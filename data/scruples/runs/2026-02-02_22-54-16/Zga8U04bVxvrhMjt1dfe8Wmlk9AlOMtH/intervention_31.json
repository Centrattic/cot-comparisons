He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who rejected her because she was \"too fat\" after initially being interested. She sent him pictures, they had a good connection, but when he saw her in person during a face-time, he said looks matter and she's too fat. She decided not to stay friends, and he's upset. The user thinks she's not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. She was upfront about her weight gain, sent photos, and he was attracted initially. Then, after the face-time, he was dismissive, ignored her for hours, and then blamed her for not wanting to stay friends. \n\nThe main issues here are respect and communication. He rejected her based on her weight, which is a sensitive issue. She felt disrespected by his silence and then his blunt rejection. She had the right to prioritize her self-esteem and end the relationship, especially after his behavior. \n\nHe claimed to value her personality at first, but then changed his stance on physical appearance. That inconsistency might be part of the problem. Also, his response of ignoring her for hours and then blaming her seems inconsiderate. \n\nThe user's reasoning is that the author isn't in the wrong. The rejection based on appearance is valid, but the author's decision to cut ties isn't wrong. People have the right to walk away from people who treat them poorly or disrespect their feelings. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She acted appropriately given his disrespectful behavior and rejection based on her body, which she had already been transparent about.\n"
