He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends with someone who rejected them for being \"too fat.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author met a guy on Tinder, they connected, and he was into her personality. She was upfront about her weight gain, sent pictures, and even showed her body during a video call. The guy then told her he found her too fat, ignored her for hours, and then tried to continue the conversation. The author felt disrespected and decided not to stay friends.\n\nThe key points here are communication and respect. The guy didn't handle the rejection well. He ignored her, which is a poor way to communicate, and then made a comment about her weight. The author was honest about her body and even showed it to him, so the guy's reaction seems to be about his own standards rather than any deceit from her. \n\nThe author's decision to cut off the friendship is her choice. She's not obligated to stay in contact with someone who's hurt her feelings. The guy's behavior\u2014ignoring her and then being upset when she's uninterested\u2014doesn't make her wrong. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is valid because of the poor communication and lack of respect from the guy. She's standing up for herself, which is a positive thing. Friendships are mutual, and if one party is toxic or disrespectful, it's okay to distance oneself.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She handled it appropriately given the guy's behavior.\n"
