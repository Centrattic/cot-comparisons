He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends with someone who rejected her because she was \"too fat.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. The author was upfront about her weight, sent full body pictures, including a nude, to be honest. The guy initially was into her, even called her \"refreshing.\" Then during a face-time, he asked her to show her body again, and she did, even though she was anxious. After that, he made a comment about her being a bigger girl, which made her feel insecure. He then ignored her for hours before finally saying he wanted to stop because she was too fat. The author decided not to stay friends, feeling hurt and disrespected due to his handling of the situation\u2014he left her hanging for a long time, which upset her.\n\nThe key points here are the guy's behavior. He initially seemed interested but then rejected her based on her body, which she had already disclosed. His response of ignoring her for hours might be seen as rude or inconsiderate. The author's decision to cut off the friendship is a reaction to feeling disrespected and the emotional impact of his rejection. \n\nFriendship and respect are mutual. If someone treats you poorly or makes you feel bad, it's reasonable to distance yourself. The guy's comment about her weight could be hurtful, especially when she was already self-conscious. The author's action was a response to his lack of respect and the emotional toll, which makes her position justifiable. \n\nHowever, sometimes people might assume that being upfront should prevent such reactions, but attractiveness can be subjective, and even with honesty, rejection can still happen. But in this case, the way he handled the rejection is questionable\u2014ignoring her for hours and then being upset when she moved on. The author isn't obligated to maintain a friendship if it's making her feel bad. \n\nSo overall, the author isn't in the wrong. Her feelings are valid, and his behavior was inconsiderate. She's protecting her self-esteem, which is important. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
