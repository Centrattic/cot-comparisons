He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

They talked on the phone a lot, and he even called her \"refreshing,\" which seems positive. Then, she sent him full-body and nude pictures to be upfront about her weight gain over the past year. He was initially okay with it and they continued talking. But during a FaceTime call where she showed him her body, he later told her he didn't find her attractive because she was too fat. The key points here are the communication issues and the guy's behavior after the rejection.\n\nThe guy rejected her based on her weight, which is a sensitive issue. She tried to be honest by sending pictures beforehand, and he accepted that. Then, after the FaceTime, he didn't immediately come out with his rejection. Instead, he ignored her for hours even though they had plans to meet that night. That silence made her feel disrespected and upset. When she finally said she wasn't interested in staying friends, he got upset about it.\n\nNow, considering AITA (Am I the Asshole) criteria, the person who did something wrong is the one who should be called out. The guy's actions here are questionable. He initially showed interest and then suddenly rejected her without clear communication. The ignoring for six hours is a red flag because it's not honest and can be seen as cruel. The author felt hurt and decided not to stay friends, which is understandable given his behavior. \n\nThe guy might be in the wrong for leading her on and then not being upfront about his feelings. The author's response to not want to continue the friendship is a reaction to his rejection and poor handling of the situation. People have different preferences, but the way he communicated his rejection is disrespectful. The author isn't the one who's being dishonest or ignoring someone here. She was upfront about her weight and even tried to be open. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong. The guy rejected her in a hurtful way, and her decision to distance herself is valid. People can't be forced to stay friends after being disrespected. The weight comment is also offensive, and his behavior of ignoring her isn't okay. The author's feelings are justified.\n"
