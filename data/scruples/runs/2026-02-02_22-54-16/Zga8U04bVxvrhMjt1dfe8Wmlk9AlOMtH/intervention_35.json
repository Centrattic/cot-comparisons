He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected her because she was \"too fat.\" Let me go through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the guy they met on Tinder seemed to like her personality and they connected well. He was into her sarcasm and being introverted. They talked a lot, even on the phone late into the night. Then he called her \"refreshing,\" which sounds positive. \n\nThe user sent full-body photos, including nude, to be upfront about her weight gain. She mentioned that she was in the process of losing weight. The guy then wanted to see her body during a face-time call. He showed his own body, which she found chubbier than expected, but she accepted it because they both discussed wanting to lose weight. \n\nWhen it was her turn to show hers, she did and then left abruptly. He responded by saying she was a bigger girl and was insecure, which made her uncomfortable. Then he ignored her for hours before finally texting that looks matter to him and she was too fat. She decided to cut off communication, which upset him because he wanted to keep talking.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that she didn't want to be friends anymore because of how he handled the rejection. He ignored her for hours instead of being upfront, leading to her feeling disrespected. The key points here are honesty about physical appearance, mutual acceptance of current bodies, his abrupt rejection after ignoring her, and her decision to end the friendship.\n\nNow, considering social norms and respect in relationships. When someone is upfront about their appearance, it's generally seen as honest. The guy, however, after showing his own body and talking about weight loss, later rejected her based on her size, which could be seen as hypocritical or inconsistent. His behavior of ignoring her for hours before giving a direct answer might be considered rude or inconsiderate, especially since they had plans to meet. The user felt disrespected because he didn't communicate clearly, which led to her emotional distress.\n\nIn terms of friendship, if someone is rejected for their body size and handled poorly, it's understandable to not want to maintain a friendship. The user's decision is based on the respect and communication issues, not just the rejection itself. Since both were upfront about their situations, the guy's actions were the problem here. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to stay friends. The guy's behavior was disrespectful, and she has a right to prioritize her self-esteem and emotional well-being. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
