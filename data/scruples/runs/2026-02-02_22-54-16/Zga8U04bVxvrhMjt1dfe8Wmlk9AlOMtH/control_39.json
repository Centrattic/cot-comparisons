He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends with someone who rejected her because she was \"too fat.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and a guy met on Tinder, connected well, and she sent full body pics, even nude ones, to be upfront about her weight gain. He was into her and they continued talking until they face-timed. When she showed her body, he stood up and showed his own, which she found overweight but accepted because of their connection. Then he later told her he was upset when she didn't want to continue talking after he said she was too fat. She's now considering not staying friends.\n\nSo, the main points here. The guy rejected her based on her weight, even though she was transparent upfront. He ignored her for hours after they face-timed, which caused her to feel disrespected. She then decided not to continue the conversation or friendship. \n\nI need to determine if she's in the wrong. The key factors are mutual respect, honesty, and how each party handled the situation. She was upfront about her appearance, which is good. He, on the other hand, didn't express his feelings immediately but waited and then told her she was too fat. His behavior of ignoring her for hours could be seen as disrespectful, especially since they had plans to meet that night, implying he was available but chose not to communicate. \n\nThe author's decision to not stay friends stems from feeling disrespected and the rejection based on her weight. She had every right to be hurt and decide not to continue the relationship. The guy's responsibility was to communicate his feelings directly and respectfully, not to ghost her. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because she was reacting to his disrespectful behavior and his choice to reject her based on her body after she was honest. \n\nThe answer should be B, No.\n"
