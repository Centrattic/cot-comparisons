He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this Reddit-style post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who rejected her because she was \"too fat,\" and she doesn't want to stay friends. The answer needs to be A or B, where A is yes she's in the wrong and B is no.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The woman (21/F) met a guy on Tinder. They connected via phone, and he liked her personality. She sent him photos, including full body and nude, to be upfront about her weight gain. He was okay with it until they face-timed. When she showed her body, he responded with a comment about her being too fat, then ignored her for hours before finally texting that looks matter. She felt he was rude, didn't respect her, and now she doesn't want to stay friends.\n\nThe key points here are about respect, honesty, and how the guy handled the rejection. The woman was upfront about her weight and the guy's response was to point out her size and then ghost her for hours. That sounds pretty hurtful. She felt disrespected because he didn't just come out and say it instead of ignoring her. \n\nIn relationships or potential relationships, communication is key. If someone is not interested, ideally they should communicate that respectfully. The guy's approach of ignoring her for hours and then bringing up physical appearance as the issue could be seen as inconsiderate. The woman then decided not to continue the friendship because of how he treated her. \n\nIs she in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends with someone who rejected her in a hurtful way? Probably not. People have the right to set boundaries and walk away from situations where they feel disrespected. The guy's behavior was poor\u2014he didn't handle the rejection well, and his comments about her weight were unkind. \n\nThe author's actions seem justified. She was honest, he was dishonest or evasive in his rejection. Her decision to end the friendship is a personal choice, and she's not wrong for prioritizing her self-esteem and emotional well-being. So the answer should be B (No, she isn't in the wrong).\n"
