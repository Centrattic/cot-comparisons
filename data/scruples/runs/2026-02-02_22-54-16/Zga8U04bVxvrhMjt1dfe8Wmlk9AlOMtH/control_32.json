He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends with someone who rejected her for being too fat.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The woman met a guy on Tinder, they connected well, and he was into her personality. She was upfront about her weight gain and even sent pictures. They faced each other via video call, and he showed her his body. She was okay with his weight, but when she showed hers, he later told her he wasn't into her because she was too fat. He ignored her for hours before responding, and she felt disrespected because of his behavior.\n\nSo, the key points here are: she was honest about her weight, he was honest too, but then he rejected her based on her weight. He also didn't communicate clearly, ignoring her for hours. She decided to cut off the friendship because of his actions.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's think about social norms and respect. Being rejected is part of dating, but the way he handled it was poor. Ignoring someone for hours after a face time is pretty rude. Also, using someone's weight as a reason to end a connection can be hurtful, and there's definitely a societal issue with body shaming. \n\nThe author's decision to not stay friends is her choice. People can choose who they want to keep in their lives, especially after being treated disrespectfully. If someone is body-shaming you and then is rude, it's reasonable to distance yourself. The guy was in the wrong for his actions, so the author isn't at fault for ending the relationship. \n\nAlso, considering she was upfront and he still went ahead to reject her in a hurtful way, she's not the one being dishonest here. So, the answer is likely B (she's not in the wrong).\n"
