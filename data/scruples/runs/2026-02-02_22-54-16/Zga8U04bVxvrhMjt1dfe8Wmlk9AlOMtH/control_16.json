He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who rejected her because she was \"too fat,\" leading her to decide not to stay friends. \n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The woman was transparent about her weight gain and even sent pictures, including a nude one. They had a good connection initially. Then, during a face-time, he saw her body, she left abruptly, and he later told her she was too fat. He ignored her for hours before responding, which upset her. She then decided to cut off contact, and he was upset she didn't want to stay friends.\n\nThe main issue here is whether her decision to not stay friends is justified. The guy's actions included ignoring her for hours, which could be seen as disrespectful, and then rejecting her based on her appearance. She felt disrespected and upset by his behavior and his rejection. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is crucial. If he couldn't be honest upfront and chose to ghost instead of communicating, that's a red flag. Also, basing rejection solely on physical appearance might be hurtful, but it's his right to express that, even if it's not ideal. However, the way he handled it\u2014ignoring her for hours\u2014adds to the disrespect. \n\nHer response to not want to stay friends is a personal choice. Since he was the one who rejected her and acted disrespectfully, she's not in the wrong for cutting contact. People have the right to leave situations where they feel disrespected or unappreciated. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She acted in her own emotional well-being and didn't owe him a friendship after his treatment."
