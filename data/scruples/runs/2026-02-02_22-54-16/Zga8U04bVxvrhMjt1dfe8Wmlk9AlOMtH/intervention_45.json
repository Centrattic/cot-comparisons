He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The situation involves a guy rejecting her because she's \"too fat,\" and she decides not to stay friends with him.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The woman, 21 years old, met someone on Tinder. They connected through text and phone calls, and he seemed into her personality. She was upfront about her weight gain, even sending full-body and nude pics. Then, during a face-time call where she showed her body, he criticized her weight and later ignored her for hours before sending a message about looks mattering. She cut ties and now he's upset, but she doesn't want to stay friends because of his handling.\n\nThe main question is whether she's in the wrong for not wanting to continue the friendship. The user thinks she's not, but wants confirmation. \n\nI should consider the dynamics here. She was honest about her weight gain, which is a sign of respect and openness. The guy, after seeing her in person, said \"I understand why you're insecure because you're a bigger girl.\" That's pretty direct and could be seen as hurtful. Then he ignored her for hours while they had plans to meet, which is inconsiderate. When she finally said she'd take his silence as a no, he replied with the looks mattering comment. His behavior seems dismissive and disrespectful, especially after the plans they had. \n\nThe author then chooses to end the communication, not wanting to stay friends. Friends should be supportive and respectful. If the guy's comments and actions led her to feel disrespected, it's understandable she'd want to cut ties. He's upset she's not staying friends, but his initial rejection based on her weight and the way he handled it (ignoring her, making her wait) could justify her stance. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often get called out for not respecting others, but in this case, the author was upfront and the guy's response was the issue. So, her decision to not stay friends seems justified. Answer B.\n"
