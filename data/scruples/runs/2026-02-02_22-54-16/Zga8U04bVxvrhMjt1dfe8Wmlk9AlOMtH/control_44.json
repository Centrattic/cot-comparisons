He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends with someone who rejected her for being too fat. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author met someone on Tinder. They connected over personality traits, talked a lot, and he was into her. She was upfront about her weight gain and even sent full-body pics, including nude ones. During a video call, he asked her to show her body, and after she did, he told her he found her insecure because she's a bigger girl. Then he ignored her for hours before explaining that looks matter and she's too fat. She felt he was rude and didn't respect her, so she cut off contact. Now he's upset she doesn't want to stay friends.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the guy rejected her based on her size after previously being interested, he ghosted her for hours, and then criticized her weight. The author decided not to stay friends because of his behavior. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, the guy's actions seem pretty hurtful. He was upfront about looks mattering, which isn't uncommon, but his handling of the situation\u2014ignoring her for hours instead of being honest from the start\u2014could be seen as disrespectful. The author was honest about her appearance and even made efforts to show him, which shows she was being transparent. His behavior of ghosting and then bringing up the weight issue might have been a manipulative way to avoid a direct rejection. \n\nThe author's decision to not stay friends is based on his lack of respect and the emotional distress he caused. She had every right to prioritize her self-esteem and emotional well-being. People can choose who they want to keep in their lives, especially when others treat them poorly. \n\nAlso, the guy's comment about her being insecure because she's a bigger girl is problematic. It's placing blame on her for his own preferences. The author isn't obligated to maintain a friendship with someone who doesn't respect her, especially when he's the one who initiated the rejection. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. Her boundaries are valid, and his actions were hurtful. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
