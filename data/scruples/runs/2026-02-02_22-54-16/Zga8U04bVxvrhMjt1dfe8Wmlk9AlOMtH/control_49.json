He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The situation involves a guy who initially seemed into the author but then rejected her for being too fat after a face-time call where they showed each other their bodies. The author is now not wanting to stay friends, and the question is if she's in the wrong for that.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was up front about her weight gain, sent full body pics, including nude ones, to be honest. The guy then asked to see her body again during a face-time. He showed his own body, which she found overweight but she accepted because they were both working on losing weight. Then when she showed her body, he told her he found her too fat. He ignored her for hours before finally texting that looks matter and she's too fat. The author felt disrespected, left hanging, and now doesn't want to stay friends.\n\nSo, the question is if she's in the wrong for cutting off contact. Let's consider the dynamics. The author was honest about her body. The guy, after seeing her, rejected her based on her weight. His behavior of ignoring her for hours and then being upset when she doesn't want to continue the relationship seems rude. The author had the right to set boundaries, especially after being treated poorly. \n\nIn relationships, if someone is honest about their preferences, and the other person's behavior is disrespectful, it's not the wrong move to distance oneself. The guy's actions\u2014ignoring for hours, then explaining his reasons for rejection\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's reaction is understandable given the emotional impact. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong). The key here is that she wasn't deceitful; she was upfront. The guy's rejection based on appearance is his choice, but his handling of the situation was poor. The author is justified in not wanting to maintain a friendship after such a hurtful experience.\n"
