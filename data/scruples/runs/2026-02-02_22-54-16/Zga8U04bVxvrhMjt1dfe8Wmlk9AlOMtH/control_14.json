He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author, a 21-year-old woman, met a guy on Tinder. They seemed to get along well initially. She was upfront about her weight gain and even sent him photos. They face-timed, showed each other their bodies, and discussed wanting to lose weight. Then, after she showed herself, the guy told her that looks matter and she was too fat. He ignored her for hours, then later wanted to continue talking, but she didn't want to stay friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors. The man rejected her based on her weight, which she was already transparent about. He didn't communicate his feelings clearly, instead ghosting her for hours. She felt disrespected because he was rude and then upset when she cut off contact. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends. Well, he rejected her for a superficial reason (weight) after she was upfront. His behavior of ignoring her and then trying to reconnect after rejecting her might be inconsiderate. She's justified in feeling hurt and choosing to end the relationship. \n\nBut maybe some would argue that she shouldn't have ended the friendship so quickly. However, given the context of rejection and the way he handled it, her decision seems reasonable. He was the one who was disrespectful in the rejection. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B makes sense here.\n"
