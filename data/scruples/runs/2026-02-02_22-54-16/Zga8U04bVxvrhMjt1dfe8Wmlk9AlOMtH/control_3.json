He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends with someone who rejected them because they were \"too fat.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The woman met a guy on Tinder, and they bonded well. She was upfront about gaining weight and shared her photos, even nude ones. They had a face-time call where she showed her body. He then told her she was too fat, ignored her for hours, and later wanted to continue talking. She decided to cut ties because of his handling, which included the rejection and ignoring her.\n\nThe key points here are about respect and communication. She was honest about her appearance from the start. The guy didn't say he wasn't attracted until after seeing her, but he let her down gently by ignoring her for hours instead of a direct conversation. That's a red flag because it's inconsiderate and leaves her in limbo. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends. Generally, if someone treats you poorly, especially after a rejection, it's reasonable to distance yourself. The guy's behavior was disrespectful, so her reaction is justified. \n\nAlso, the guy's comment about her being \"too fat\" is problematic. It's important to consider body positivity and how such comments can affect someone's self-esteem. She had already been anxious about her weight, and his remark likely hurt her. \n\nSo, the answer would be that she's not in the wrong. The guy acted disrespectfully, and she's within her rights to stop the friendship. So the answer is B."
