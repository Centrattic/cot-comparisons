I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong by changing their neighbor's internet password after the neighbor stopped paying. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and her husband set up a second WiFi connection for their neighbor, who initially paid $40/month. Then the neighbor started being late, paid half upfront, then stopped paying altogether. The author is considering changing the password until payment is made.\n\nSo, the main question is whether cutting off the neighbor's internet access is justified. Legally, if there was an agreement, the neighbor might be breaching it by not paying. But the author provided the WiFi as part of that agreement. Without payment, the author could have a right to terminate the service. However, there might be other considerations. For example, was there a written agreement? If not, proving the terms could be harder. Also, the neighbor might not have a contract, so the author's action could be seen as taking matters into their own hands instead of going through proper channels like mediation or small claims court.\n\nEthically, it's about fairness. The neighbor isn't paying, so the author isn't getting the agreed-upon money. But cutting off internet access might be a direct consequence. However, the neighbor might rely on that internet for work or other necessities. Also, the author mentions they can afford the payments, but it's for their savings. But if the neighbor is using the internet, maybe she's also relying on it for her own needs.\n\nAnother angle: Did the author and husband set up the WiFi as a form of payment arrangement? If they provided the service and the neighbor isn't paying, withholding the service could be seen as cutting off a utility they provided. However, if the neighbor isn't fulfilling her part of the agreement, the author has a reason. The problem is whether changing the password is an appropriate response. It could be considered a form of economic coercion, which might not be legal, especially if it's not outlined in the terms of their agreement.\n\nAlso, in some jurisdictions, disconnecting someone from a service they've paid for (even if indirectly) might have legal repercussions. The author might be overstepping by taking unilateral action instead of addressing the issue through the correct channels. They should probably send a formal notice or seek legal advice before taking such action.\n\nIn conclusion, while the neighbor isn't paying, the author's method of enforcing payment by changing the password might be seen as inconsiderate and possibly illegal. The proper approach would be to communicate clearly, send reminders, and if necessary, take legal steps rather than acting on their own.\n"
