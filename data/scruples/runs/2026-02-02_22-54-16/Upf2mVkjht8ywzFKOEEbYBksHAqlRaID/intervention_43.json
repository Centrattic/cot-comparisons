I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password. The situation is that the neighbor was paying $40 a month for internet, but then started missing payments and now the author wants to cut off the internet until payment is made.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the agreement between the two parties. They had an informal setup where the neighbor pays for the internet. The author and her husband agreed to provide a second Wi-Fi connection in exchange for the $40. The neighbor started paying, then got late, then stopped. The author feels that since they're saving for a mortgage and have kids, they can't afford to absorb the cost anymore.\n\nNow, the key question is whether changing the password is justified. Legally, if there was an agreement, the author might have a right to enforce payment. However, without a formal contract, it's more of a moral or ethical issue. The neighbor isn't paying, so the author is cutting off the service. But is this the right approach?\n\nEthically, the author might feel they're in the right because they provided a service (internet access) and the neighbor agreed to pay. If the neighbor breaches the agreement by not paying, the author could argue they're justified in stopping the service. However, changing the password without prior warning could be seen as a harsh measure. Maybe the author should have tried to communicate more, like sending a notice or giving a deadline before taking action.\n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor is using the internet without paying, which is essentially freeloading. The author is within their rights to stop providing the service if the payment isn't made. The fact that the neighbor is seen shopping and buying a car suggests she has the means, so the author's actions might be seen as protecting their own resources.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of being a good neighbor. Cutting off internet could be seen as a petty or confrontational move, especially if done without proper communication. Maybe there's a misunderstanding or an issue the neighbor is facing that the author isn't aware of. However, the author did mention that the neighbor hasn't made any effort to communicate about the payments, which is a red flag.\n\nIn terms of legal standing, without a written agreement, it's hard to enforce payment. So the author's action might not be legally wrong, but ethically, it's a gray area. The community might have different views\u2014some might support the author's right to protect their own resources and savings, while others might think the situation should be handled through more formal channels like sending a formal notice or involving a mediator.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer hinges on whether the author's action is a reasonable enforcement of their agreement. If they had a mutual understanding and the neighbor is in breach, changing the password is a way to enforce payment. However, it's important that the author communicated their intentions beforehand. Since the author didn't mention prior warnings in the scenario, maybe they should have done that. But given the information, the author is trying to uphold the agreement they had, so they might not be in the wrong. But there could be arguments either way.\n"
