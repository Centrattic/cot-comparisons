I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully. The user is asking if changing the neighbor's internet password is wrong. The setup is that the neighbor offered to pay $40/month for the internet, which they initially agreed to. The neighbor stopped paying after some delays and now the author is considering changing the password until payment is made.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspect. When someone offers a service (like internet access) for a fee, and the other party agrees, it's a form of contract. If the neighbor isn't paying as agreed, maybe the author has the right to stop the service. But wait, the author set up the second wifi connection for the neighbor. So the internet is a shared service, and the author is acting as a middleman, charging the neighbor for a portion of the cost. But the main provider is the internet company, and the author isn't the official provider. So maybe there's a difference here. If the author isn't the ISP, they might not have the right to cut off someone's access. Because the internet is a shared resource; changing the password would be using their control over the local network. But legally, if the neighbor is using the author's wifi, the author could argue that they have a right to set the terms. But if the neighbor is on a separate network that the author controls, then maybe they can enforce payment by changing the password.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author is not in immediate financial need, but they are saving for a mortgage and have two kids. The neighbor isn't paying, and it's affecting their savings. The neighbor isn't making an effort to pay, even though she can afford it. The author might feel justified in cutting off the service until payment is made. However, using the password as leverage might be seen as taking matters into their own hands. If the neighbor had a contract or agreement, maybe the author should go through proper channels, like sending a formal notice or involving the building management if there's any policy. But since it's a private arrangement between neighbors, maybe it's up to them to resolve. \n\nAlso, the author mentioned that the neighbor approached them with the offer. So it was the neighbor's idea to pay for the internet. The author agreed. Now the neighbor isn't paying. The author could argue that they're enforcing the original agreement. But if there was no written contract, the enforcement might be tricky. The author could be seen as taking unilateral action, which might not be the best approach. Maybe they should have a conversation first, but it seems like they've already tried that. The author says they don't want to chase the neighbor down, so changing the password is their way of enforcing payment without confrontation.\n\nBut is that the right approach? Some might say that the author should have a written agreement to avoid such issues. Without a contract, the neighbor could argue that the arrangement was informal and the author can't just cut off access. Legally, the author might not be in the wrong if they control the network, but ethically, some might say it's reasonable to stop providing the service when the neighbor isn't paying. On the other hand, others might say that the author should have a more formal agreement in place before doing that. \n\nAlso, changing the password could be considered a breach of trust or a hostile action, especially in a community setting. The neighbor might feel it's unfair if the author has the control over the network. Maybe the author should have made it clear from the start that non-payment would result in losing access. So if that was part of the original agreement, then changing the password is justified. If not, maybe the author is overstepping.\n\nIn the end, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the author has the technical control over the network and the neighbor agreed to pay, then the author might not be in the wrong. However, if there's no formal agreement, the author's action could be seen as taking the law into their own hands. The answer might depend on local laws and the specific circumstances, but since it's a hypothetical, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're trying to enforce a prior agreement, even if it's informal.\n"
