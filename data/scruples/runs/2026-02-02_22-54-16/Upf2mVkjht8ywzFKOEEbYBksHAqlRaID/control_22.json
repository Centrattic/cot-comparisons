I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password because the neighbor stopped paying. The situation is that they set up a second wifi for the neighbor who initially paid, then became late with payments, and now hasn't paid at all. The author is considering changing the password to stop the neighbor from using the internet until she pays up.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the neighbor is using the internet without explicit permission from the service provider, the author might be liable. Even if they agreed to share the connection, the service might be under the author's account, so cutting off access could violate the terms of service or even be illegal. Also, the author could be in breach of a contract if there was an agreement in place. But the original agreement was verbal or informal, so maybe there's no legal binding here.\n\nEthically, the author is trying to enforce a payment arrangement they had. The neighbor isn't paying, and the author feels it's their right to stop the service. But since the internet is a shared resource, the author might have a responsibility to handle this through proper channels. Changing the password without notice could be seen as taking the law into their own hands. The neighbor might still have a right to the internet she agreed to pay for, even if she's not up to date with payments. The author's actions could disrupt the neighbor's access, which might be necessary for her to work or take care of her kids.\n\nAnother angle: the author's own use of the internet. If they control the router, changing the password might also affect their own connection if they have a single router. But the setup here is a second wifi connection, so maybe they can isolate the neighbor's network. However, even if that's possible, the legal repercussions could be an issue. The neighbor could potentially call the police or report the internet provider's account being tampered with. \n\nAlso, the author is saving for a mortgage and has two kids, so the $40 a month adds up. But they've been covering the cost themselves, which might be their choice. The neighbor's non-payment is a breach of their agreement, but the author might need to address it through communication or formal methods rather than just cutting off access. Maybe sending a letter or using mediation services if available. \n\nWhat about the neighbor's situation? She's a single mom but also has a new car and buys things weekly. The author might think she's not in need, but the question is about the author's actions. The author's frustration is understandable, but how to resolve it properly. \n\nIn summary, while the neighbor isn't paying as agreed, the author's act of changing the password unilaterally could be seen as taking matters too far. It's better to handle through formal agreements, written contracts, or contacting the service provider if possible. Since there's no explicit legal agreement mentioned, the author might not be in the right. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
