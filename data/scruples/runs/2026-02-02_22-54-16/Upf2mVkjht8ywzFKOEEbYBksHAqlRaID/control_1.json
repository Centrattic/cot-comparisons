I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password due to unpaid rent.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their husband set up a second Wi-Fi for their neighbor, who agreed to pay $40/month. Initially, payments were on time, then became late and then stopped. The neighbor isn't in financial trouble, buying stuff regularly and got a new car. The author wants to cut off the neighbor's internet until payment is made.\n\nThe key points here are the agreement between the parties. If there was a mutual agreement where the neighbor paid for the service, then the author might have a right to enforce payment. However, the legality and morality might differ. \n\nLegally, changing someone's password without their consent could be a privacy violation. In some places, this might even be illegal, as it's a form of unauthorized access. Even if the author set up the Wi-Fi, the neighbor might have a right to the service as per their agreement, and cutting it off could breach that agreement.\n\nEthically, the neighbor is in breach of the agreement by not paying. The author is trying to enforce payment, which is understandable. But using a personal action like changing the password might be seen as taking matters into one's own hands, which could be problematic. The proper course would be to remind the neighbor of the agreement, send a formal notice, or even involve a mediator or legal system if necessary.\n\nThe author mentions they can afford the payments but want to save for a mortgage. While that's their prerogative, the neighbor's non-payment is a breach of contract. However, using a personal password change as a form of collection might not be the best approach. It's possible the neighbor could retaliate or there could be legal repercussions for the author.\n\nIn summary, while the neighbor is in the wrong for not paying, the author's method of enforcing payment might be legally and ethically questionable. The correct approach would be to handle it through proper channels rather than unilateral action. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for changing the password without going through the appropriate legal steps.\n"
