I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for considering changing their neighbor's Wi-Fi password. The situation is that the neighbor agreed to pay $40/month for internet access, but stopped paying. The author is thinking about cutting off the Wi-Fi until payment is made.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if they had a formal agreement, maybe the author has a case. But in reality, most such arrangements might not be legally binding without a contract. So changing the password could be seen as taking matters into one's own hands, which might not be legally sound. Even if the neighbor was supposed to pay, the author might not have the legal right to cut off access unilaterally. \n\nEthically, the author is upset about the neighbor not paying, and they're trying to enforce the agreement. But is it fair to cut off a service that the neighbor might rely on? The neighbor might have her reasons for not paying, even if she can afford it. The author is using the Wi-Fi as leverage, which could be seen as punitive. Also, the author mentions they can afford the cost, so maybe the issue is more about principle. However, using the Wi-Fi as a bargaining chip could disrupt the neighbor's life, especially if she's a single mom with kids. Ethically, that might be harsh.\n\nAlso, the original arrangement: was it mutual consent? The neighbor approached them with the offer, and they agreed. If the neighbor stopped paying, the author might have the right to ask for the money, but changing the password without notice could be considered a breach of the agreement. The proper approach might be to communicate, send a formal request, or even involve a mediator. Changing the password without prior communication could be seen as taking an aggressive step without due process.\n\nAdditionally, in some places, landlords or building management handle such shared utilities. If the author is the one managing the internet, perhaps they shouldn't be the ones to cut off access without going through official channels. There's a risk of escalating the conflict, especially in a small apartment where neighbors have to interact.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is not necessarily in the \"wrong\" legally, but ethically and socially, it's questionable. The answer might depend on the context. But since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the options are A or B, probably the answer is A (Yes, in the wrong) because changing the password without proper process could be seen as unfair or taking the law into their own hands. Even if they have a right to do so, it's not the best approach. The correct course of action would be to attempt to resolve it through communication or legal means, not by cutting off essential services.\n"
