I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the writer and her husband have an apartment where they installed internet. A neighbor above them, a single mom, approached them and offered to pay $40 a month for a second Wi-Fi connection. Initially, she paid on time, then became late, then offered half now half later, and then stopped paying. The writer feels she's not in a financial hardship because the neighbor seems to buy things regularly and got a new car. They don't want to chase her for the money but are saving for a mortgage and have their own kids. The writer is considering changing the password until the neighbor pays what's owed.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if changing the password is justified. Legally, if there was an agreement, the neighbor might be breaching that by not paying. However, the original setup was that the neighbor approached them with the offer, and they agreed. So there's an informal contract here. The neighbor not paying could be a breach. \n\nBut the writer is using the neighbor's access to their Wi-Fi as leverage. However, the internet is the writer's responsibility and expense. So if the neighbor was given access as part of an agreement, withholding it might be a way to enforce payment. But is that legal or ethical?\n\nLegally, the neighbor might have no right to the Wi-Fi unless it's part of a formal agreement. If the writer set it up for her, maybe there's an implied contract. But changing the password could be seen as a form of self-help. However, in some jurisdictions, this might be considered a civil issue rather than criminal. The writer could be within their rights to stop the service if payment isn't made as per the agreement.\n\nEthically, it's a bit tricky. The writer is trying to enforce payment without being confrontational. But using the password change as a method to enforce payment might seem harsh. The neighbor might not have any other way to get internet, so cutting it off could inconvenience her. However, the writer isn't cutting off their own access; they're just revoking the neighbor's access. \n\nThe key points are: the neighbor agreed to pay, stopped paying, and the writer wants to stop access until payment. The writer isn't in a financial need but is saving for a mortgage. The neighbor's behavior shows she's not in financial trouble. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if there's an agreement, the writer can enforce its terms. Ethically, it's about whether using the password change is fair. The writer isn't stealing from her; they're removing a service she was using without paying. However, in some cases, landlords can't unilaterally cut off services, but this is a neighbor-to-neighbor situation, not a landlord-tenant. \n\nSo, in a neighbor situation, if they informally agreed to this, the writer might have the right to stop the access. But there might be other ways to handle it, like a formal notice or involving the building management if it's a shared service. Since it's a private setup, the writer has control. \n\nHowever, changing the password could be seen as a form of retaliation or using a coercive method. If the neighbor had a contract, the writer should follow the terms, which might include a process for non-payment. Without a formal contract, it's more of an ethical grey area. \n\nIn conclusion, the writer might not be in the wrong legally but could be ethically if they're taking it upon themselves to enforce payment without proper notice or recourse. But since the neighbor agreed to pay and the writer set it up for her, changing the password to enforce the agreement might be justified. The answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
