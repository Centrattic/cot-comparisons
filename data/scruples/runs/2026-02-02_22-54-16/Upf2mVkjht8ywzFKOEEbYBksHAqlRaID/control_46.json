I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering changing their neighbor's internet password because the neighbor isn't paying the agreed-upon $40/month.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and their husband set up a second Wi-Fi connection for the neighbor, who initially paid but then started missing payments. The neighbor seems to have means, so it's not a financial hardship, but rather a matter of not keeping up with the payments. The author is considering changing the password until the neighbor pays up.\n\nSo, the main question is about whether changing the password is an appropriate action. Legally, the neighbor is using the internet as part of an informal agreement. The author isn't a service provider, so they might not have the legal right to cut off service for non-payment. The neighbor might have a right to use the internet as long as the agreement exists, even if it's not formalized. \n\nEthically, the author is trying to enforce the agreement, but using the Wi-Fi password as leverage might be problematic. The author could argue that since they're the ones paying the bill and the neighbor isn't, they have a right to stop the sharing if payments stop. However, changing the password without notice could be seen as cutting off a utility that the neighbor relies on, even if it's informal. \n\nAlso, there's a question of communication. The author mentions that they haven't directly asked the neighbor for the money again after she stopped paying. Maybe a better approach would be to remind her of the agreement and discuss the payments first before taking action. \n\nAnother angle: the neighbor might have agreed to the payment terms but isn't honoring them. The author could be seen as trying to enforce the agreement they had, which might be reasonable. However, changing the password without a prior agreement about what happens in case of non-payment could be abrupt. \n\nIn terms of morality, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to be paid what's owed. But the method of enforcing payment by cutting off internet access might be seen as harsh. The neighbor might have other obligations and cutting internet could affect her and her children. However, the author is also saving for a mortgage, so their financial goals are important too.\n\nThere's also the aspect of community and relationships. If the author changes the password, it might lead to conflict. It's possible that the neighbor didn't realize she was supposed to continue paying or might have a valid reason for the delay. The author hasn't communicated clearly, which could be part of the issue.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's intention is understandable, but the action of changing the password without prior discussion might be considered inconsiderate. The correct answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because the appropriate step would be to communicate and possibly terminate the agreement through proper channels rather than just changing the password.\n"
