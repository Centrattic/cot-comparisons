I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who changed their neighbor's internet password is in the wrong. The situation is that they set up an agreement where the neighbor pays $40 a month for internet access. Initially, the neighbor paid on time, then started being late, offered half now/half later, and then stopped paying completely. The author is considering changing the password to enforce payment.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legality and ethics here. The neighbor agreed to pay, so there's a contract in place, even if it's informal. If someone breaches a contract, what are the legal remedies? Usually, you can't just take matters into your own hands and shut off services. That might be considered a breach of contract or even a civil wrong. The author is trying to enforce payment by cutting off the service, which is similar to a landlord turning off utilities for unpaid rent, which is illegal in many places. So maybe that's a parallel here.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author feels that chasing the neighbor is not their responsibility, especially since the neighbor isn't making it easy. However, changing the password could be seen as a form of retaliation that affects the neighbor's ability to use the internet, which might be important for their work or daily life. The neighbor might not have other options for internet access, especially if it's a small apartment building. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the neighbor isn't in financial distress\u2014they have a new car and buy groceries regularly. So the neighbor has the means to pay, which makes the situation more about willful non-payment. The author is trying to enforce the agreement they made, but in a way that's unilateral. \n\nWhat's the appropriate way to handle this? Legally, the author might need to go through a formal process, like sending a demand letter or small claims court, rather than taking direct action. By changing the password, they're taking enforcement into their own hands, which could backfire if the neighbor sues for breach of contract or intentional interference with property. \n\nEthically, while the author has a right to be upset about unpaid bills, cutting off internet might be seen as disproportionate. The neighbor could face significant inconvenience, and the author might lose a neighbor in a good relationship. There's also the aspect of setting a precedent\u2014others might do the same if they get into similar situations.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because they're using a method of enforcement that's not legally sound and could be considered unethical. The proper course would be to pursue legal avenues rather than taking unilateral action. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
