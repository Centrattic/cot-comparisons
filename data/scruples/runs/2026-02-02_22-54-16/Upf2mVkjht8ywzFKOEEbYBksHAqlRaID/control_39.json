I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password because the neighbor stopped paying for the shared Wi-Fi. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The neighbors agreed to pay $40/month for the internet, and initially, the neighbor paid on time. Then she started being late, offered half now half later, and then stopped paying. The author is considering changing the password to enforce payment.\n\nSo, the main question is whether changing the password is justified. Legally, if there's an agreement where one party is paying for internet access, and the other is providing it, then the paying party (neighbor) has a contractual obligation. If she stops paying, the provider (author) could terminate the service. But the internet is in the author's name, so they might have the right to control access. However, in some places, changing passwords without notice might violate terms of service with the internet provider, or could be seen as a civil matter.\n\nEthically, the author is trying to enforce a verbal agreement. The neighbor isn't paying, and the author isn't getting paid. The author isn't in a position where they can't afford the bill themselves, but they want the neighbor to honor the agreement. Changing the password could be seen as a way to enforce the contract, but it might be considered harsh or take the law into their own hands. The neighbor might not have a way to contest if the password is changed, especially if she's reliant on that internet.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If there's no formal contract, maybe the author's actions are more about enforcing a verbal agreement. However, changing someone else's access without a legal process could be problematic. For example, if the neighbor had a contract with the internet provider, changing the password might not be allowed. However, since the setup was done by the author, maybe they have control over it.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author has the right to do that. If the internet is under their name, they can manage access as they see fit. But if the neighbor's payment is part of an agreement, then stopping service for non-payment is enforcing that agreement. However, in some cases, you need to follow proper procedures, like giving a notice before cutting off service.\n\nAlso, considering the neighbor's situation, the author might not need the money, but they want the neighbor to honor the agreement. The author might be within their rights to stop the service if the neighbor hasn't paid, but there could be other ways to handle it, like sending a formal notice or involving a mediator.\n\nIn terms of legal advice, it's possible that the author is within their rights to terminate the service if the neighbor isn't paying, given that the initial agreement was made. But there's a risk that if the neighbor sues, the court might see it as a breach of the informal contract. Alternatively, if there's no formal agreement, the author's actions might be seen as a violation of the neighbor's rights if she's relying on that service.\n\nSo, the answer could depend on the jurisdiction and the specifics of the agreement. But in general, if there's an agreement and the neighbor isn't fulfilling their part, the author might have the right to stop the service. However, the method of changing the password could be seen as taking matters into their own hands, which might not be the best approach legally or ethically. They might have been better off sending a formal demand or closing the agreement properly through a written contract.\n\nBut since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer could be that they are not in the wrong (B), because they are enforcing an agreement, but there's a nuance here. However, given the way the situation is presented, the author's actions might be seen as justified if there was a mutual agreement, so the answer could be B.\n"
