I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password. The situation involves a neighbor who was set up with a second WiFi connection for $40 a month. Initially, she paid, then got late, then did a half payment split, and eventually stopped paying. The author is considering changing the password to stop her from using the internet until she pays up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, sharing internet access is a gray area. If the neighbor was using the internet without a proper agreement, maybe the author can stop it. But they had an agreement where she pays them. The author is enforcing the terms of their arrangement, which could be seen as justified. However, if the neighbor is still using another method to pay the bill, like maybe she has her own provider, but the author controls the network, then changing the password could be cutting off a service they agreed to provide.\n\nEthically, the author might feel they're being unfair if they have to provide the internet without payment. The neighbor isn't paying, so the author might think they're entitled to stop the service. But on the other hand, changing the password could disrupt the neighbor's ability to access the internet, which might be necessary for her to work or for her kids to do homework. That could be considered inconsiderate, especially if there's no prior warning.\n\nThe original agreement: if they set up the second WiFi specifically to charge her, then the author has the right to stop the service if payments aren't made. However, if the neighbor had another way to access the internet legally, the author can't cut off her internet that way. But since it's a shared or second connection, maybe the author can. Also, the author mentions they're paying the bill themselves, so they might be out of pocket. But the neighbor might be using a different provider, so this is about the WiFi access they provided.\n\nThe author is not the ISP; they can't control the neighbor's main internet. If the neighbor is using the author's WiFi as her main connection and isn't paying, the author can technically block access. However, this might be seen as a breach of some mutual understanding if not properly communicated. The neighbor might be in the wrong for not paying, but the author's method of enforcing payment could be problematic if done without notice. The author could have tried to communicate again before changing the password, but if they've already made it clear and the neighbor ignored it, then maybe it's acceptable.\n\nIn terms of what's right or wrong, the author's action could be seen as taking control back from a breach of agreement. But there's a question of whether the neighbor has a contract with the author or the ISP. If the author is the one who set up the WiFi, then they might have the right to manage access. However, if the neighbor is under the assumption that the main internet is being billed to her through the author, that's different. The author should verify if the neighbor is using their WiFi as the main connection or just an additional one.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation is understandable\u2014saving for a mortgage and having their own kids. Not having to chase payment is a valid reason. But changing the password without notice might be abrupt. They might have sent a warning first, but the scenario doesn't mention that. If they did, then it's more justified. If not, it's possibly seen as a bit of a trap.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author has a right to manage that specific WiFi access and if they communicated the terms clearly. Since the neighbor was the one who initiated the offer and the author agreed, the author is within their rights to stop the service if the neighbor isn't fulfilling the payment terms. However, it could be considered inconsiderate if there's no prior warning. But given that the author is not the ISP and the neighbor's main access might not be through them, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
