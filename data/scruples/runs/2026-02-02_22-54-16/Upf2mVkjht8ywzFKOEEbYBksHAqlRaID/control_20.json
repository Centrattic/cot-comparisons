I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong if they changed their neighbor's internet password because the neighbor stopped paying them. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author and their husband allowed the neighbor to have a second Wi-Fi connection in exchange for $40 a month. The neighbor initially paid on time, then became late, offered to pay half now and half later, and then stopped paying altogether. The author is considering changing the password to enforce payment.\n\nSo the question is: is the author in the wrong for doing that? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the legal and ethical aspects here. Legally, if there was a verbal agreement, that's enforceable, but it might be hard to prove without written documentation. However, the neighbor is breaching the agreement by not paying. The author is cutting off access as a form of enforcement. But is that legal? In many places, you can't just cut someone off from a service you agreed to provide without following proper procedures. You might need to terminate the agreement through proper channels, like sending a formal notice, not just changing the password. Changing the password could be seen as a breach of contract or even a form of harassment if it's considered an unfair penalty. \n\nEthically, the neighbor agreed to pay, and the author is trying to enforce that. However, the author is using a method that affects the neighbor's access to the internet, which might be necessary for her single mom duties, like work or kids' needs. The author could be seen as standing up for their agreement, but maybe the approach is too harsh. They might need to communicate first, send a formal demand, or involve a mediator. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they can afford the cost, but they want to save for a mortgage. That's a personal financial decision. Legally, if the neighbor is breaching the contract, the author might be entitled to terminate the service, but doing so abruptly without notice could be problematic. The neighbor might have a right to access until the agreement is properly terminated. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, services like internet, even if shared, are considered part of the property's amenities. If the author controls the network, they might have the technical ability to change the password, but they might be required to give notice or provide a way for the neighbor to resolve the issue. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author might not be in the wrong ethically if they feel the neighbor is breaching the agreement, but legally, they might be overstepping by unilaterally cutting off service without following proper procedures. However, since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the answer might lean towards A (yes) because changing the password is a form of taking matters into their own hands without legal justification. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the answer is A because the author is enforcing a contract but in an illegal way. Alternatively, B if it's considered a reasonable response. \n\nWait, but in many places, you can't just cut someone off from a service they were paying for. The author might be the one breaching the agreement by terminating it unilaterally. The neighbor might have a right to keep the service until the agreement is legally terminated. So the author is in the wrong (A) because they can't just change the password without following the correct legal steps, like sending a termination notice, not just doing it. So the answer is A.\n"
