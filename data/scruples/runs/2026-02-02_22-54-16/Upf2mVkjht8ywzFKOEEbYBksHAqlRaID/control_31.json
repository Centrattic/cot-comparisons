I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering changing their neighbor's internet password.\n\nSo the context is that the neighbor offered to pay $40 a month for internet, and they agreed. The neighbor started late, then paid half, then stopped. The author is thinking of cutting off the internet until payment is made.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the internet was installed under the author's name, they might have the right to control access. But if the neighbor was given access as a guest, changing the password could be within their rights. However, if there's a formal agreement, maybe the neighbor is entitled to access as long as they pay. But since the payment isn't up to date, the author could argue they're terminating the service for non-payment.\n\nEthically, it's about fairness. The author isn't in desperate need of the money but wants to enforce the agreement they made. The neighbor isn't paying, so the author is trying to enforce the terms they agreed upon. On the other hand, cutting off internet might be seen as a harsh measure, especially if the neighbor relies on it for work or other essentials. But the author is saving for a mortgage and has two kids, so prioritizing their own financial goals makes sense.\n\nAnother angle: the author isn't chasing the neighbor for payment, which might be a passive approach. But the neighbor isn't communicating about the debt either. The author's action could be a way to prompt payment without confrontation.\n\nI should also consider if there's any harm. If the author changes the password, the neighbor loses internet access, which could be inconvenient. However, the author isn't causing physical harm, just enforcing a service agreement. The neighbor can choose to pay up or stop using the service.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if the original agreement allowed for termination upon non-payment, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if there was no formal agreement, maybe it's a bit gray. The key is whether the author's action is a reasonable enforcement of an informal agreement. Since the neighbor agreed to the payment terms initially, the author is acting within their rights to stop the service when terms aren't met.\n\nSo the answer would likely be B, No, the author isn't in the wrong. They're enforcing an agreed-upon arrangement when the other party isn't fulfilling their part.\n"
