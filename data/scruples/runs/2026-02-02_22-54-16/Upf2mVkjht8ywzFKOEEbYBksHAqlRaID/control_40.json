I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password because the neighbor hasn't been paying the agreed-upon $40 a month. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author and her husband live in an apartment building. A single mom above them offered to pay $40 a month for internet, which they set up for her. Initially, she paid on time, then got late, then paid half up front and half later, then stopped altogether. The author argues that the neighbor isn't struggling financially, given her purchases and new car. They don't need the money desperately but are saving for a mortgage with their own kids. The author considers changing the Wi-Fi password until the neighbor pays up.\n\nNow, the key points here. The original agreement was that the neighbor pays $40 a month for internet access. The author provided the internet service, and the neighbor wasn't fulfilling her part of the agreement. The author is thinking of cutting off access as a way to enforce payment.\n\nBut wait, when you have an internet service, typically it's a subscription you pay the provider for. If they set up a separate Wi-Fi for the neighbor, maybe they're splitting the existing internet connection. But if they're the ones providing the service, maybe they have control over it. However, legally, if the internet is in the author's name, they might have the right to control access. But there's a difference between a verbal agreement and a legal contract. Since they agreed verbally, the neighbor might not have a legal obligation to pay, but the author might have the right to control their own network.\n\nHowever, taking matters into one's own hands can have consequences. If the neighbor is using the internet under an informal agreement, changing the password could be seen as cutting off a service she's relying on, which could lead to conflict. Also, if the internet is part of the building's service, maybe the author isn't the sole provider. Another angle: if the neighbor is paying for a service she's supposed to get, the author might be within their rights to stop the service if payment isn't made. But in a community setting, there might be expectations of mutual respect. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the neighbor has been neglectful in payments, but the author hasn't mentioned if they've formally asked for the money or given a deadline. If they haven't communicated clearly, maybe the neighbor is unaware of how serious the situation is. The author might need to have a conversation first before taking action. \n\nLegally, changing the Wi-Fi password could be seen as a breach of any agreement, but since the agreement was informal, it's unclear. However, ethically, if the author is providing a service with the expectation of payment, they have the right to stop the service if payment isn't made. But there's also the aspect of privacy and security. If the neighbor is using the internet without permission, even if an agreement was made, changing the password could be appropriate. \n\nBut in this case, the neighbor was given access under an agreement to pay. So the author's action is a form of enforcing that agreement. However, if the neighbor is relying on that internet service, cutting it off could disrupt her and her children. The author might be justified in enforcing the agreement, but maybe there's a better way to handle it, like sending a formal notice or involving a mediator. \n\nIn summary, the author's action might be seen as justified because they provided a service under an agreement that the neighbor isn't fulfilling. However, the method of enforcement (changing the password) could be considered harsh or confrontational. It's possible that the author is in the right because they have the right to control their own network, but they might also be in the wrong if they should have handled it through proper channels first. But given the informal nature of the agreement, the author's action is probably not in the wrong.\n"
