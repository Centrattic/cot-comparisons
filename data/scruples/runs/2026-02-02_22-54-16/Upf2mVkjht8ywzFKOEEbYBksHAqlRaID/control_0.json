I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering changing their neighbor's internet password because the neighbor isn't paying. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author and husband set up a second WiFi for their neighbor, who agreed to pay $40/month. Initially, the neighbor paid on time, then got late, then half-paid, then stopped entirely. The author argues that the neighbor isn't in financial trouble since she buys a lot and got a new car. They don't want to chase the money, and they can afford to pay the bill themselves, but they're saving for a mortgage with their own kids. The question is whether changing the password is wrong.\n\nSo, the main points here are the agreement between the two parties. The neighbor offered the deal, and the author agreed. Now, the neighbor isn't fulfilling their part. The author is considering cutting off access until payment is made.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if there's a verbal agreement, it's still a contract. However, enforcing it might be tricky. Without a written agreement, it could be hard to prove the terms. Legally, the neighbor might still have a right to the service they've already paid for, or if it's part of the building's main internet, maybe the landlord's policy comes into play. But the scenario says the author set up a second WiFi specifically for the neighbor, so maybe that's a personal arrangement.\n\nEthically, the author is trying to enforce a mutual agreement. The neighbor is breaching the agreement by not paying. The author isn't trying to harm, just to make the neighbor follow through. However, cutting off access unilaterally might be seen as taking the law into their own hands. Instead of changing the password, the proper approach might be to send a formal request, maybe involve the building management, or even small claims court if necessary.\n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. If the author changed the password, they might be seen as taking a reasonable step given the neighbor's non-payment, but others might argue that they should have gone through proper channels first. However, since there's no evidence of a formal agreement beyond their own arrangement, the author's actions could be seen as justified from their perspective, but maybe not the best approach.\n\nAnother angle: If the neighbor's access is part of the building's main internet, the author might not be the one who controls it. But the setup here is that the author set up a separate connection for the neighbor, so they have control. In that case, changing the password is within their control, but maybe not the most professional or mature way to handle it.\n\nIn \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" forums, people often debate the social ramifications. Even if technically right, cutting off someone's internet might be seen as harsh. However, the neighbor initiated the arrangement, so the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The neighbor's non-payment is the issue here.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer might hinge on whether there's an enforceable agreement. If the author and neighbor only had a verbal agreement, then the author's action might be seen as self-help, which is sometimes acceptable if all other options are exhausted. However, if there's no formal agreement, the author might be overstepping. But given the scenario, since the neighbor approached them and they agreed, the author's action could be justified as enforcing their own terms. However, ethically, it's iffy because it's a neighbor and there's a personal relationship involved. Maybe the correct answer is that the author is in the wrong because cutting off access without going through proper legal channels is taking it into their own hands. But others might say they're within their rights if the agreement was mutual. Hmm. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong because they're not using proper methods to resolve the debt. They should have sent a demand letter or something first.\n"
