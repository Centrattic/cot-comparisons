I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether changing a neighbor's internet password is wrong, given the neighbor hasn't been paying for the service they agreed to. The setup is that the neighbor approached the author and husband, offered to pay $40/month for a second Wi-Fi connection. Initially, the neighbor paid, then became late, then half-paid, then stopped altogether.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the author set up the internet for the neighbor as a service agreement, there might be some basis for terminating the service if payments are not made. However, usually, internet service providers handle billing and access. In this case, the author is acting as a private individual, not an ISP. So, legally, the author might not have the authority to enforce such terms. But maybe there's an implied contract here. If they agreed to provide the service for payment, and the neighbor isn't paying, the author could argue a breach of contract. However, enforcing that by changing the password could be seen as self-help, which might not be legally sound. Also, the author might be violating terms of service from their own ISP if they're sharing the connection, but that's another angle.\n\nEthically, the author is frustrated because the neighbor isn't paying as agreed. They don't want to chase the neighbor, but the neighbor isn't taking the obligation seriously. The author is in a position where they can afford the loss but want to save for a mortgage. Changing the password could be seen as a reasonable way to enforce the agreement, but it's also cutting off a service that the neighbor might rely on. However, the neighbor agreed to pay and didn't, so the author might feel justified. But is it ethical to take such action without a formal agreement? If there was a written agreement, it might be clearer. Since it was a verbal agreement, it's more complicated. The author could be seen as taking the law into their own hands. However, given that the neighbor isn't paying and the author is trying to enforce the agreed terms, the author might not be in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer would depend on whether there was a clear agreement and if changing the password is a proportionate response. The author's reasoning is understandable, but without a legal contract, it's risky. However, since the neighbor initiated the arrangement and agreed to the terms, the author might have a valid point. So, the answer could be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance.\n"
