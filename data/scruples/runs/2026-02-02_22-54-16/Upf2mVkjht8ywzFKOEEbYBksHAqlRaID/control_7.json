I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password because the neighbor stopped paying. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their husband set up a second wifi connection for the neighbor, who agreed to pay $40/month. Initially, the neighbor paid on time, then started being late, offered to pay half now and half later, and eventually stopped paying. The author is considering changing the password to enforce payment.\n\nThe main question is about whether this action is wrong. Legally, the author provided internet access as a service, and the neighbor agreed to pay. If payment is overdue, the author might have the right to stop the service. But there might be a formal agreement or contract involved. If there was a verbal agreement, it could be harder to enforce. Also, in some places, utilities like internet might have different regulations, but since this is a shared setup, maybe it's more of a private agreement.\n\nEthically, the author is trying to get their money back. They don't need the payment to survive but want to save for a mortgage. The neighbor isn't paying, which is a breach of their agreement. Changing the password is a way to enforce payment. However, cutting off service without notice might be seen as harsh. Maybe they should have given the neighbor a formal notice before taking action.\n\nAnother angle: the author's approach could be considered a form of self-help. If the neighbor isn't paying, the author can't just take the money without a proper agreement. However, since the service is being provided, stopping it when payment isn't made could be justified if there was an agreement. But if there's no written contract, it's a bit iffy. \n\nAlso, there's a potential for escalation. The neighbor might retaliate or there could be legal repercussions if the neighbor sues for breach of agreement. The author might need to go through proper channels, like sending a formal demand letter or involving the building management if applicable.\n\nIn terms of community relations, changing the password without communication could damage the relationship. The author might have a right to do it, but the method could be questionable. Maybe they should have communicated first, given a final warning, and then changed the password. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's action might be legally justified if there was a clear agreement, but ethically, it's a gray area. However, the act of cutting off service without a formal process might be seen as inconsiderate or overly harsh. The answer might depend on the specific laws regarding shared services and verbal agreements. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and given that changing the password is a form of taking matters into one's own hands without following proper procedures, the answer could be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't go through the proper legal or community channels first. Alternatively, if the agreement was clear and the neighbor breached it, then B (no, not in the wrong) might apply. But considering the lack of a formal contract and the potential for conflict, the answer is likely A.\n"
