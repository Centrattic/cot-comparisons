I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they live in an apartment and have a neighbor above them. The neighbor, a single mom, asked to use their internet for $40 a month. Initially, she paid on time, then got late, paid half upfront, and then stopped paying altogether. The author is considering changing the neighbor's Wi-Fi password until she pays up.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if they set up the internet and agreed to share it for a fee, the neighbor is entering into a contract. If she's not paying, they might have a right to stop the service. But maybe there's a problem with how they enforced it. They might have an informal agreement, but in some places, you can't just cut off someone's service without following certain procedures. Maybe they need to give her notice or follow some other steps first.\n\nEthically, the author feels wronged because the neighbor isn't paying her share. The author isn't needing the money for daily expenses but is saving for a mortgage. The neighbor, on the other hand, isn't fulfilling her part of the agreement. The author might feel justified in stopping the service as a way to enforce payment. However, changing the password could be seen as a harsh measure, especially if the neighbor relies on the internet for work or communication. Also, the neighbor didn't approach the author with the offer; she came to them, so maybe the author had the right to set terms from the start.\n\nAnother angle is that the internet is a service they're providing, so they have the right to revoke it when terms aren't met. However, the neighbor might not be aware of the password change unless the author informs her. The author's approach could be seen as taking matters into their own hands instead of addressing the issue through proper channels, like sending a formal notice or involving the building's management if there's a policy against this. \n\nAlso, considering the neighbor's behavior, she's not making an effort to pay, which might make the author's action seem more justified. But maybe the author should have communicated more clearly about the consequences of missing payments before changing the password. The fact that the author isn't in a dire financial situation might mean that their motivation is less about financial need and more about enforcing the agreement, which could be a point in their favor.\n\nHowever, changing the password without notice could be disruptive for the neighbor. If the neighbor isn't paying, the author should perhaps follow some formal process rather than just cutting off access abruptly. There could be legal repercussions if the author's action is considered a breach of contract or if it's against the building's rules. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they had an agreement, and the neighbor isn't holding up her end. But the method of enforcement (changing the password without notice) could be problematic. The correct approach might involve sending a written notice first, giving a deadline, and then taking action if that's ignored. Since the author didn't mention doing that, it's possible they're acting rashly, which could put them in the wrong. But the neighbor's behavior is definitely contributing to the conflict. The answer might depend on whether the author's action is proportionate and follows proper procedures. If they followed up properly, maybe they're not in the wrong, but if they just changed the password without any prior communication beyond the initial agreement, then they might be.\n"
