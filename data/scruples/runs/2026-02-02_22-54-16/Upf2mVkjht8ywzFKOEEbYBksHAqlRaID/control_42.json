I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person in the scenario) is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password after the neighbor stopped paying. \n\nFirst, the situation: They live in an apartment building. The neighbor, a single mom, asked to split the internet cost, paying $40/month. Initially, she paid, then became late, then half payments, then stopped altogether. The author feels they don't need to chase her for the money but want her to pay. They can afford it but are saving for a mortgage. Now, they're considering changing the password to enforce payment.\n\nSo, the key points here. The agreement was made for the neighbor to pay $40/month. Both parties agreed. The neighbor breached the agreement by not paying. The author is considering cutting off access as a way to enforce payment.\n\nLegally, if there's a contract or agreement, both parties are expected to follow it. However, the internet setup isn't a legal contract unless there were formal terms. But in a practical sense, there was an informal agreement. The neighbor isn't following through, and the author is trying to enforce it. \n\nEthically, is changing the password acceptable? Well, the author isn't using any formal means, like contacting the neighbor directly, sending a written notice, or seeking mediation. They're taking a direct action by changing the password. This could be seen as a form of self-help, but it's also cutting off a service someone was relying on. The neighbor might not have the internet for other reasons besides her payment issue, which could affect her children, her work, etc.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author changed the password without prior communication or a formal agreement, they might be acting unilaterally. The neighbor might have expected continued service until the agreement is dissolved. The author's action could be seen as taking matters into their own hands instead of resolving it through proper channels. \n\nAlso, consider power imbalances. The author has the technical ability to control access, and the neighbor is in a vulnerable position as a single parent. The author might be justified in wanting to enforce the agreement, but their method could be problematic. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, changing the password without prior discussion might be seen as wrong because it's a drastic step. The right approach would be to communicate, perhaps remind the neighbor of the agreement, then escalate if needed. If they don't pay, then cutting off access might be justified, but only after giving notice and a chance to pay. \n\nSo, in this case, the author is acting without prior communication, which might make them in the wrong. They should have given the neighbor a chance to pay before taking action. Therefore, answer A (author is in the wrong) would be appropriate.\n"
