I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password to enforce payment. The author and their husband agreed to let the neighbor use their internet for $40/month, but the neighbor stopped paying. Now the author is considering changing the password until payment is made. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are the agreement between the neighbors and the actions taken by the author. The original agreement was that the neighbor pays $40/month for internet access. The neighbor initially paid on time but then started missing payments, even though she has the means. The author is now considering cutting off access until payment is made.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in most places, there's no enforceable legal contract here unless there's a written agreement. Since the setup was informal, the author might not have legal grounds to enforce the payment through such a method. However, from a moral or ethical perspective, people might see it differently. The neighbor isn't paying as agreed, so the author is trying to enforce the original terms. \n\nBut changing the password could be seen as a form of taking matters into one's own hands, which might not be the best approach. It could lead to conflict or escalation. A more appropriate action might be to send a formal notice or stop sharing the internet unless payment is made up front. However, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to enforce the agreement they made. The neighbor isn't a tenant, so the author can't really evict them for non-payment. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author has the right to seek payment for a service rendered, especially if it was agreed upon. However, cutting off access without some form of notice or legal means could be problematic. But since there's no legal contract, it's more about personal ethics. The author is trying to protect their own interests and savings for a mortgage, which is understandable. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They are enforcing an agreement that was made, even if informally. The answer should be B: No.\n"
