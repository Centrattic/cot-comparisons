I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password because the neighbor stopped paying for a shared internet connection.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The neighbor (a single mom) approached the author and her husband with an offer to split the internet cost, initially paying $40/month. At first, she paid on time, then became late, then paid half upfront, and finally stopped entirely. The author feels that the neighbor isn't in financial trouble, given her visible spending habits. The author is considering changing the neighbor's password to enforce payment, even though they can afford to cover the cost themselves but are saving for a mortgage.\n\nThe key issues here are: 1) Was there a formal agreement? 2) Did the author have the right to enforce payment by cutting off access? 3) Is changing the password a reasonable action or a breach of trust?\n\nFirst, the initial agreement was mutual; the neighbor offered to pay, and the authors agreed. However, agreements between neighbors often aren't formal contracts, so enforceability might be an issue. The neighbor's payments stopped, and the authors feel they shouldn't have to chase for money. But changing the password is a form of taking matters into their own hands.\n\nLegally, if there was a verbal agreement, it can be a contract, but enforcing it might be tricky without evidence. However, ethically, the authors might feel they're justified. But cutting off internet access without notice could be seen as harsh. The neighbor might have other means to pay, but the authors are using a necessary service as leverage. This could be considered a form of self-help, but it's often frowned upon because it can escalate conflicts.\n\nAlso, the authors mention they can afford the payments, so maybe they could have communicated the issue first, given a final notice, or ended the arrangement amicably instead of cutting off access abruptly. Changing the password without prior communication might be seen as a hostile act, making the authors appear in the wrong.\n\nIn many WIBTA scenarios, taking direct action without attempting to resolve the issue through communication is usually seen as the wrong move. The authors might have been better off sending a final notice to end the agreement if payments weren't received, rather than cutting off access. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
