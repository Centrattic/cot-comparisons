I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author and their husband agreed to provide internet to their neighbor for $40/month. The neighbor initially paid on time but then started being late, then paid half up front, and now stopped paying entirely. The author is considering changing the password to withhold the internet until payment is made.\n\nFirst, there's the agreement between the two parties. They had an informal arrangement where the neighbor offered the payment and the author's side set up the second Wi-Fi. So there's an implied contract here. If one party isn't fulfilling their part, the other might have grounds to take action. However, the method of enforcement matters.\n\nChanging the password is a direct action without any prior formal notice. The author mentions that the neighbor isn't in financial trouble, which suggests the issue isn't about inability to pay but possibly negligence or intentional non-payment. The author also states they don't want to chase the neighbor, which is understandable.\n\nBut legally and ethically, taking control of someone's service without a proper agreement or legal process could be problematic. Even if the agreement was verbal, the author might not have the legal right to shut off the service unilaterally. There might be local laws about utility services and how to handle payment disputes. Additionally, doing so could lead to legal repercussions if the neighbor files a complaint.\n\nEthically, some might argue that the author is within their rights if the agreement was mutual, but others might say that the proper way is to communicate clearly, send reminders, or even terminate the service through official channels. Changing the password without giving a final warning or a chance to pay could be seen as harsh, especially if the neighbor relies on the internet for work or other essential needs.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they can afford the payments but are saving for a mortgage. The $40 is important for their savings. However, the neighbor's side might not be aware of the urgency or the savings goal. The author's approach might be seen as justified in their own right, but without proper communication, it's a bit abrupt.\n\nIn summary, while the neighbor isn't paying, the author's method of enforcing payment by changing the password might not be the correct course of action. They should probably first send a formal notice, then if necessary, discontinue the service through a more formal process rather than taking unilateral action that could be considered a breach of the informal agreement or local laws.\n"
