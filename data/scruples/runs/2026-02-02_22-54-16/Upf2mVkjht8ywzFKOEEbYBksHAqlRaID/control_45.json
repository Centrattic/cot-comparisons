I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password because she stopped paying her share. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The neighbor offered to pay $40/month for internet access, and the original residents agreed. Initially, she paid on time, then started being late, then paid half, then stopped. Now, the author wants to disable her access until she pays up.\n\nThe question is whether changing the password is justified. Legally, if the neighbor is a tenant in the apartment building, maybe the landlord handles the internet. But in this case, since it's a private agreement between neighbors, maybe it's more of an informal arrangement. However, if the internet is installed in a place where the author is the main user, and they've allowed the neighbor access, does the neighbor have a right to it? \n\nFinancially, the neighbor agreed to pay, so there's a mutual agreement. If she's not fulfilling her part, the author might feel justified in stopping the service. But the author is using their own resources to cover the bill, so there's a financial loss here. \n\nEthically, is it right to cut off service because someone isn't paying? Well, if the original agreement was that she pays, then not paying means breaking that agreement. However, the author is the one who allowed the access, so they could argue they have the right to revoke it. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of being a good neighbor. Maybe the author should have confronted the issue earlier, like sending a reminder or discussing the payment issues before taking action. Changing the password without notice might be seen as harsh. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they don't need the money but want to save for a mortgage. Still, the neighbor's non-payment is a breach of the agreement. The author might not be in the wrong for enforcing the agreement. But legally, if there's no formal contract, it's hard to enforce. \n\nIn terms of the WIBTA community, they often consider social norms. Even if it's morally justified, the action of changing the password might be seen as petty or extreme. The author could be seen as in the right for enforcing payment, but others might say they should have addressed it differently first, like sending a formal notice or involving management if it's a rental.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether there's a formal agreement. Since it's a private agreement between neighbors without a contract, the author's action is more about enforcing a verbal agreement. Legally, it's tricky, but socially, they might be seen as in the right for taking action after the neighbor repeatedly failed to pay. However, some might argue that the author should have handled it more professionally, perhaps by cutting off access after a warning and documented requests for payment. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they were enforcing a prior agreement, but some might argue that the method is harsh. However, since the neighbor breached the agreement, the author is within their rights to stop the service.\n"
