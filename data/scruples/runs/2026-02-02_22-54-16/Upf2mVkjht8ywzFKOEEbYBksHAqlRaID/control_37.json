I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering changing their neighbor's Wi-Fi password because the neighbor stopped paying for the internet they were using. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their husband agreed to let the neighbor use their internet for $40/month. The neighbor initially paid but then started missing payments. The author is thinking about changing the password to force the neighbor to pay up. \n\nSo, the key points here are: there was an agreement, the neighbor isn't paying, and the author wants to enforce payment by cutting off access. Now, I need to figure out if this action is morally or legally wrong.\n\nLegally, if there was a verbal agreement, it's still a contract. If the neighbor isn't paying, the author might have grounds to terminate the service. However, changing the password without notice could be seen as a breach of the agreement if they didn't specify that non-payment would result in that. But in many places, you can terminate a service if the terms aren't met, even if it's a verbal agreement. But maybe the author should have a formal way to terminate, like giving notice.\n\nMorally, the author's intention is to get paid for a service. They're not in dire need, but saving for a mortgage. The neighbor isn't paying despite having the means. The author doesn't want to chase them, which is understandable. Changing the password is a direct way to enforce the agreement. But maybe they could have tried other methods first, like a written notice or mediation. \n\nBut the neighbor has been getting the internet without paying, which is unfair. The author's action is a form of taking back their service. However, cutting off access might disrupt the neighbor's life, especially if they have a child. But the neighbor chose to use the service, so maybe they should have known the terms. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't set up the service with clear terms, so maybe they should have a better agreement next time. But given the situation, the author is trying to uphold their side of the deal. \n\nSo, considering both legal and moral aspects, the author might not be in the wrong. They have a right to enforce payment for the service they provided. However, there could be better ways to handle it, like communicating clearly first. But the question is whether they're in the wrong for changing the password. \n\nIn some cases, changing the password could be seen as a form of self-help, but it's also possible that a more formal approach is needed. However, since there's no legal agreement, the author's action might be a way to protect their own interests. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (No), because the author is trying to enforce a prior agreement and isn't causing harm beyond cutting off the service they're being paid for. The neighbor isn't being harmed beyond losing access they agreed to pay for. However, if there's a more reasonable approach, that's a different matter, but the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not whether there's a better solution.\n"
