I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering changing their neighbor's internet password because the neighbor hasn't been paying the agreed-upon $40/month. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The neighbor approached the author and their husband to set up a second Wi-Fi connection, with the agreement that the neighbor would pay $40 a month. Initially, the neighbor was paying, then started being late, offered a split payment, and eventually stopped paying altogether. The author feels it's unfair to subsidize the neighbor's internet when they can clearly afford it, as seen by their purchases and new car.\n\nNow, the key points here are the original agreement and the enforcement of it. The neighbor and the author had a mutual agreement. If the neighbor isn't fulfilling her end by paying, is the author justified in cutting off the internet? Legally, maybe not, because the agreement was verbal (since it's a neighborly arrangement), and without a formal contract, it's hard to enforce. However, morally, if the neighbor agreed to pay and isn't, the author might feel wronged.\n\nBut changing the Wi-Fi password is an action that affects the neighbor's access. The question is whether the author has the right to enforce the terms of their agreement by themselves. In a typical landlord-tenant scenario, a formal contract would be necessary, and the landlord would follow proper procedures for unpaid rent. Since this is a private agreement between neighbors, the author's actions could be seen as taking the law into their own hands. \n\nAlso, considering the neighbor's financial capacity, the author might feel justified, but others might argue that the proper course of action is to first communicate, then perhaps involve a mediator or legal steps if the neighbor doesn't comply. Changing the password without notice could be seen as a breach of trust or even a form of harassment, especially if there's no prior warning.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't in a position of authority, so self-help measures might be considered reasonable in some contexts. However, since this is a shared resource, the author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to protect their own financial interests, especially if the neighbor isn't meeting their obligations. But the method of cutting off access without formal procedures could be problematic.\n\nIn summary, while the neighbor's non-payment is the initial wrong, the author's response of changing the password could be seen as taking matters into their own hands without proper resolution steps. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not pursuing more formal methods before taking action. However, others might argue that the neighbor's non-payment justifies the action. The answer likely hinges on whether the action is proportionate and follows due process. Since the author hasn't tried to resolve this through communication or mediation first, changing the password might be considered in the wrong.\n"
