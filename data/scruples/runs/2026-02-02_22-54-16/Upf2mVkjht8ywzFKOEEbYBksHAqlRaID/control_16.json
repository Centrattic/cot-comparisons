I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering changing their neighbor's internet password because the neighbor isn't paying her share.\n\nFirst, the setup: The couple set up a second Wi-Fi connection for their neighbor in exchange for $40/month. The neighbor initially paid but then started being late, offered a split payment, and now isn't paying at all. The couple is saving for a mortgage and doesn't want to chase the neighbor for payments. They're thinking about changing the password until the neighbor pays up.\n\nSo, the key points here are the agreement between the neighbors. The couple provided a service (internet access) and the neighbor agreed to pay. When the neighbor stopped paying, the couple is considering cutting off access. Legally, if there's a verbal or informal agreement, the couple might have the right to terminate the service if payments aren't made. However, in many jurisdictions, you can't just cut someone off from a shared resource without some form of legal agreement. It might depend on whether the neighbor was supposed to be paying for the service or if it's considered a rental for the space.\n\nEthically, the couple is trying to enforce a payment they were promised. But changing the password could be seen as taking matters into their own hands. The proper approach might be to send a formal request for payment or terminate the informal agreement through proper channels, like sending a notice or involving the building's management if it's a shared space.\n\nAlso, the neighbor's behavior is questionable\u2014she's not paying despite having the means. But the couple's response might be seen as a form of self-help that could escalate the conflict. They could potentially be in the wrong if there's no formal agreement allowing them to cut off service, as it might be considered a breach of contract or even a violation of the neighbor's rights to the service they were initially allowed to use.\n\nIn some places, landlords have specific rules about such arrangements, but since this is a neighbor and not a landlord-tenant situation, the rules might be less clear. The couple might be within their rights if they had a clear agreement, but without that, changing the password could be problematic.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical aspects, the author might be in the wrong because they're using a self-help method without following proper procedures. The correct approach would be to communicate clearly, send a formal request, and if necessary, involve legal means or the building's management. Changing the password could be seen as an overreach and might lead to further conflict or legal issues.\n"
