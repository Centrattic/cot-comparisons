I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of a \"Would I Be A [Asshole]\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author and her husband provided internet to their neighbor for $40 a month. The neighbor initially paid, then started being late, then stopped altogether. The author is considering changing the neighbor's Wi-Fi password to force payment.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if changing the password is a reasonable action or if it's overstepping. The initial agreement was verbal? The neighbor approached them with the offer, and they agreed. So there's a mutual understanding. The neighbor isn't paying, and the author is upset because they have to cover the cost, and they're saving for a mortgage. \n\nThe key points here: Was there a formal agreement? If it's just a verbal agreement, then legally it's still binding, but enforcement might be tricky. The author is using the internet password as leverage. By changing it, they're cutting off the neighbor's access. But the neighbor's access was part of the original agreement. So, if the neighbor isn't paying, the author has a right to stop the service. But is changing the password an appropriate way to do that?\n\nHowever, there are other considerations. The neighbor is a single mom, and maybe the author is being a bit judgmental about her financial situation. The author mentions the neighbor has a new car and buys items weekly, but that doesn't necessarily mean she can't pay. Maybe she has other financial obligations. The author could have addressed this by talking to her first, maybe sending a reminder, then a final notice before cutting off. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, if they had an agreement, the author can terminate the service if payment isn't made. However, ethically, there might be a better way. Also, changing the password might be seen as taking matters into their own hands instead of going through proper channels. If the neighbor is using the internet without paying, the author could report the unauthorized use to the internet provider, but that might be more involved.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they have a right to stop the service when payment isn't made, then no. But if the neighbor is still technically allowed access despite non-payment, then changing the password could be a breach. But since they agreed to a payment arrangement, the author can reasonably require payment for continued service. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. But the answer depends on the existence of a valid agreement. Since the neighbor initiated the arrangement, and the author agreed, changing the password is a reasonable step to enforce the terms. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
