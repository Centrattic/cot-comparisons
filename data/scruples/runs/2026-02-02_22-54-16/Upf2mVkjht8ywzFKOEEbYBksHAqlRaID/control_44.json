I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" post is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password. The situation is that they agreed to provide a second Wi-Fi connection for the neighbor in exchange for $40 a month. The neighbor initially paid on time, then started being late, switched to paying half up front and half later, and eventually stopped paying. The author is considering changing the password to make the neighbor pay first.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the agreement. If there was a mutual agreement where the neighbor offered to pay and the author accepted, then the neighbor is in breach by not paying. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to enforce the terms they originally agreed to. However, changing the password without notice might be seen as cutting off a service they've been providing, which could have consequences. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The main points are: the original agreement, the neighbor's non-payment, and the author's response. Since the neighbor is the one who initiated the offer and the author agreed, the author is within their rights to stop the service if the neighbor isn't fulfilling their part. The author mentions that they can afford the extra cost, but they're saving for a mortgage, so it's their choice to manage their finances. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have given more notice or tried to communicate further. But the neighbor also isn't reaching out to pay, and the author doesn't want to chase them. In that case, stopping the service as a form of payment reminder could be justified. Legally, if there's no formal contract, it might be a gray area, but morally, the author is protecting their own interests after a prior agreement. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're enforcing a prior agreement and the neighbor isn't paying as promised. The author isn't the one who broke the terms first.\n"
