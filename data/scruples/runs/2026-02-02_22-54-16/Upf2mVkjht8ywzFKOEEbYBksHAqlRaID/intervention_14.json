I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author and their husband set up a second Wi-Fi for their neighbor, a single mom, who agreed to pay $40/month. Initially, she paid on time, then got late, then half now/half later, and now stops paying altogether. She seems to have money since she shops frequently and bought a new car. The author is considering changing the password to enforce payment.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if there was a verbal agreement, can the author enforce it by cutting off the Wi-Fi? If there's no formal contract, it might be harder to enforce in court. However, maybe the initial agreement was mutual, so changing the password could be seen as enforcing their part of the deal. But is that legal? Maybe not, because the neighbor might have a right to the service she's paying for, but she's not paying now. \n\nEthically, the author is trying to get their neighbor to pay what's owed without being aggressive. They don't want to chase her, which is understandable. But cutting off the internet is a form of coercion. It might pressure her to pay, but could also be seen as unfair if there's no clear agreement. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they can afford the payments but are saving for a mortgage. So it's not about necessity but about fairness. If the neighbor agreed to pay and then isn't following through, the authors might feel justified. But if they didn't set clear terms from the start, maybe they contributed to the problem by not having a written agreement. \n\nAnother angle: Is the second Wi-Fi a shared resource? If the internet is provided by the building, maybe the neighbor already has access, and the authors aren't allowed to charge extra. That could be a legal issue. But the question states that the setup was done with the neighbor's request, so maybe it's a private agreement. \n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, if the authors agreed to provide the service for payment and the neighbor isn't honoring that, changing the password could be seen as protecting their own interests. But it's also a form of taking matters into their own hands instead of using legal means. \n\nHowever, the authors might not want to escalate to formal complaints or legal action, which could strain the community. So their action is a middle ground. But is that acceptable? It depends on societal norms and local laws. In some places, cutting off a service someone is supposed to pay for might be allowed under a verbal agreement, in others not. \n\nSince the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, and the options are A or B, I need to weigh these factors. The authors didn't force the agreement; the neighbor approached them. The authors agreed, and the neighbor isn't fulfilling her part. Changing the password to enforce payment seems like a self-help measure. It's not violent, but it's withholding a service she's supposed to pay for. \n\nIn many places, if there's a service agreement (even verbal), the provider can stop the service if payments are not made. So legally, maybe the authors are within their rights. Ethically, if the neighbor is being reasonable, the authors might be justified. But if the neighbor is in a vulnerable position, maybe it's not. However, the neighbor isn't shown to be in hardship; she has money. \n\nSo overall, the authors might not be in the wrong. They have a right to enforce their agreement, even if it's verbal. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
