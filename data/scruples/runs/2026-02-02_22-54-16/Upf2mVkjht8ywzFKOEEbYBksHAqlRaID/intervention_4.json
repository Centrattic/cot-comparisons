I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password because the neighbor stopped paying for the shared Wi-Fi. \n\nFirst, the setup: The couple agreed to provide a second Wi-Fi network for their neighbor in exchange for $40/month. The neighbor initially paid on time, then became late, then paid half, and finally stopped. The couple says they can afford it but are saving for a mortgage and don't want to chase the neighbor for payments. The question is if changing the password is justified.\n\nI need to consider both legal and ethical angles. Legally, if there was a clear agreement and the neighbor is in breach, the couple might have a case, but it's a civil matter. However, using a password to cut off access could be seen as a form of self-help, which might not be legally advised. Ethically, it's about fairness and respect. The neighbor isn't paying as agreed, so the couple wants to enforce the agreement. But is cutting off internet a fair response? It could be a necessary action if they can't collect the debt otherwise. However, some might argue it's a harsh measure and they should go through proper channels like sending a formal notice or involving a mediator. \n\nAlso, the neighbor's behavior is a factor. The neighbor isn't acknowledging the debt when they see her, which adds to the couple's frustration. The couple's actions might be seen as a justified enforcement of the agreement they made. However, others might say that the couple should have set clearer terms from the start, maybe in writing, to avoid such disputes. \n\nIn summary, the answer hinges on whether the couple's method of enforcing the agreement is considered reasonable. Since the neighbor breached the agreement, the couple is trying to uphold their end. Changing the password is a direct action to stop a service they're being paid for. Legally, it's a gray area, but ethically, it might be seen as a reasonable step given the circumstances. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
