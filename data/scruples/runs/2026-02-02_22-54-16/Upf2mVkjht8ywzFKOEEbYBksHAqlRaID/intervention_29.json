I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and their husband set up a second internet connection for their neighbor, a single mom, and agreed she would pay $40 a month. Initially, she paid on time, but then started being late, then paid half upfront, then stopped altogether. The author mentions the neighbor isn't in financial trouble since she buys a lot of stuff and got a new car. The author is considering changing the neighbor's Wi-Fi password to stop her from using internet until she pays what's owed. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nHmm. Let's think about legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if there was a verbal agreement for her to pay monthly, and she's not fulfilling that, the author might have a right to enforce the terms. However, changing someone's internet access without notice could be seen as a breach of service or even a form of coercion. Legally, depending on the jurisdiction, this might not hold up because cutting off services could be considered a civil matter where they should go through proper channels like sending a formal notice, mediation, or small claims court.\n\nEthically, the author is frustrated because the neighbor isn't paying as agreed. The neighbor isn't acknowledging the debt openly, which adds to the author's frustration. But taking matters into their own hands by changing the password could be seen as taking a proactive step to enforce the agreement, but it's also a form of punishment without due process. The author might argue it's fair to stop the service until payment is made, but others might say it's unfair because the neighbor could face consequences like losing her internet without a proper warning or legal recourse.\n\nAlso, the neighbor might not have a backup plan for internet, so suddenly losing it could disrupt her work or other important activities. The author's intention is to get payment, but the method might be harsh. There's also the aspect of maintaining good neighbor relations. If they cut off the internet, it could lead to conflict. However, the neighbor isn't respecting the agreement, which is a breach.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should have set clearer terms from the start, maybe in writing. Since they didn't, their options might be limited. Legally, without a contract, enforcing payment through self-help measures might not be valid. The author might need to pursue formal legal action if the amount is significant. Alternatively, cutting off the service could be considered a civil matter where the author has the right to terminate the service if the neighbor defaults, but again, this depends on local laws.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's actions are a form of self-help, but without a formal agreement, they might not have a legal basis. Ethically, while understandable, it's a gray area. The answer depends on whether you prioritize legal correctness over the ethical frustration of unpaid debts. Since the user's own analysis is that the author is not in the wrong, but the question is whether they are, I need to decide based on standard norms. In many places, altering someone's service without legal process is not advised, so the author might be in the wrong. But others might argue they have a right to enforce the agreed terms. I think the safer answer is that the author is in the wrong because the proper course is to go through legal channels rather than self-help measures, even if the neighbor isn't paying.\n"
