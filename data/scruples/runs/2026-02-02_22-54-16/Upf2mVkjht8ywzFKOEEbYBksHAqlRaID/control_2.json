I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor who was given free Wi-Fi access in exchange for paying $40 a month. The neighbor started missing payments and now the author is considering changing the Wi-Fi password until payment is made.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the scenario details. The neighbor approached them about setting up the second Wi-Fi, agreed to pay, and initially paid on time. Then she started being late, then half payments, then stopped altogether. The author notes that the neighbor seems to have the means, as she shops regularly and bought a new car. The author is frustrated because they don't want to chase her for payment and are saving for a mortgage. The question is whether changing the Wi-Fi password is justified and if the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the agreement between neighbors. Legally, when you set up something like this, it's a verbal agreement. But in terms of legality, would changing the password be a violation of any laws? Possibly. If the neighbor is paying for the service, but the provider (the author) is cutting off service without notice, that might be a breach of their agreement. However, in many places, landlords or internet service providers have specific rules about this. Since this is a private arrangement between neighbors, the legal standing might be unclear.\n\nEthically, the author might feel justified because they're not getting paid and the neighbor isn't fulfilling her part of the agreement. But the neighbor might have a right to the Wi-Fi if it's been set up. The author's action could be seen as a form of taking justice into their own hands. Also, cutting off the service entirely might be harsh, especially if the neighbor needs it for work or other essential purposes. The author could have tried sending a formal notice or giving a warning before changing the password.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author's actions are proportionate. The neighbor's debt is $40 a month, and the author is cutting off the Wi-Fi, which could be a significant inconvenience. However, the author is also saving for a mortgage, so the financial aspect is important. The neighbor's behavior of not paying despite having the means is a valid concern.\n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. Legally, maybe not if there's an agreement. However, in terms of community and neighbor relations, changing the password without a formal notice might be seen as abrupt. The correct approach might have been to give a final warning or send a written notice. Also, the author should consider if there's a way to resolve the payment issue through communication rather than cutting off access.\n\nIn the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) context, the community often emphasizes respect and communication. So even if the author has a legitimate grievance, taking unilateral action without trying to resolve it through proper channels might be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not exhausting other options first.\n"
