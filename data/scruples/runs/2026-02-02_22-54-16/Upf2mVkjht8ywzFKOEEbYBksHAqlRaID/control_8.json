I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for considering changing their neighbor's internet password.\n\nSo, the setup: The author and her husband live in an apartment where they installed internet and set up a second Wi-Fi for the neighbor, a single mom. The neighbor offered to pay $40 a month, and they agreed. Initially, she paid on time, then started being late, then paid half up front and half later, and then stopped paying altogether. The author feels she isn't in financial trouble since she has a new car and shops regularly. The author is considering changing the password to stop her from using the internet until she pays up. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects here. Legally, if there was a formal agreement, the author might have grounds to enforce payment. But since it's a neighborly arrangement without a contract, it's more of an informal agreement. Legally, they might not have the right to cut off internet access without going through proper legal channels. However, ethically, the situation is more gray. \n\nThe author is trying to enforce payment without being aggressive, but changing the password could be seen as taking matters into their own hands. They might be justified in wanting to be paid, but the method could be problematic. The neighbor isn't paying, and the author doesn't want to chase her, so changing the password is a way to apply pressure. However, this could be considered a breach of the neighbor's access, especially if the original agreement was that she could use the internet for that price. If the author removes access, it's like cutting off a service she was paying for, even if she hasn't paid. But since she hasn't paid, maybe the author is within their rights to stop the service.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of property rights. If the internet is under the author's name and they own the router, they have control over it. However, if the neighbor was relying on that internet access, changing the password without notice might be harsh. Also, if there's a prior agreement that the neighbor can use it for $40, then stopping access might be enforcing that agreement. But maybe the author should have a conversation first instead of cutting off the service unilaterally.\n\nAnother angle: The author mentions they can afford it but want to save for a mortgage. So, it's not just about the money but also about the principle of being paid for the service. The neighbor's behavior is disrespectful, not paying as agreed. The author's response is to stop the service until payment. In some contexts, this is standard practice (like utilities cutting off service if you don't pay), but in a shared living situation, it's more sensitive. The neighbor might not have alternative internet access, so cutting it off could inconvenience her. However, if the agreement was clear, the author might not be in the wrong.\n\nBut legally, if there's no formal contract, it's hard to enforce. The author might be within their rights to stop the service since it's their property. However, ethically, they might be wrong to do so without giving the neighbor a chance to explain or resolving it through proper channels first. Maybe the author should have sent a formal notice or involved the building management if there's any. \n\nIn terms of the WIBTA aspect, the community often considers whether the action is the \"wrong\" thing to do socially. Changing someone's password without notice could be seen as harsh and confrontational, even if the person is in the wrong. It could lead to more conflict. The author might be justified in wanting to be paid, but the method might be socially inappropriate. So, in the WIBTA context, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they're taking a strong action that could escalate things without giving the neighbor a chance to respond.\n\nBut I'm a bit torn. If the author is enforcing a prior agreement, they might not be wrong. However, without a formal agreement, it's more of a social contract. The neighbor wasn't paying, so the author is trying to enforce payment by stopping the service. But maybe the author should have followed up with reminders or sought mediation instead of cutting off access abruptly. So, the author's action might be seen as justified in principle but the execution is questionable. \n\nIn summary, the answer likely depends on the interpretation of the informal agreement and the appropriateness of the action taken. Since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong (A for yes, B for no), considering the community's perspective, changing someone's password without notice could be seen as the wrong thing to do socially, even if the underlying issue is valid. So the answer might be A.\n"
