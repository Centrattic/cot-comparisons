I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nSo, the neighbor offered to pay $40/month for internet access, which the couple agreed to. Initially, the neighbor paid on time, but then started being late, then only paid half, and then stopped altogether. The couple isn't getting the money, and the neighbor isn't bringing it up when they see each other. The couple can afford it but are saving for a mortgage and have kids. They're considering changing the password to force payment.\n\nFirst, is there a formal agreement? It seems like a verbal agreement. They didn't have a written contract. If there's no written agreement, that might affect the enforceability. But in many places, verbal agreements can still be legally binding, though harder to prove. However, the main question here is about morality or social norms, not necessarily legal standing.\n\nNext, the neighbor is not paying, despite having the means. The couple feels they shouldn't have to chase the money. They are using the internet as leverage. Changing the password would cut off the neighbor's access until payment is made. \n\nIs this a fair response? On one hand, the couple gave their consent to provide internet in exchange for payment. If the neighbor isn't fulfilling her end, the couple could argue they have the right to revoke the service. But on the other hand, the internet was a shared resource, and taking unilateral action might be seen as harsh or not following proper channels.\n\nWhat are the proper channels? The couple could have sent a formal notice, maybe a written reminder, or even involved a mediator. Changing the password without prior communication might escalate the situation. Also, if the couple is the one who installed the second connection, they might have control over it, but does that justify cutting off someone who used to pay?\n\nAnother angle: the neighbor might be using the internet for essential purposes, like work or school, especially since she's a single mom. Cutting off access could inconvenience her, but the couple isn't doing it maliciously\u2014they want payment. However, the neighbor might not have agreed to such terms in the original arrangement. The couple is using a service as a bargaining chip, which could be seen as a form of coercion.\n\nIn terms of social acceptability, people often frown upon cutting off services without proper communication. The couple should probably have tried other methods first, like a polite but firm reminder, or setting up a payment plan. Changing the password without prior notice might be seen as taking the law into their own hands, which could make them look in the wrong.\n\nAlso, if the neighbor had a car and shopping habits, maybe she can afford to pay but is choosing not to. However, the couple's decision to change the password could be a reasonable step after multiple failures in communication. But the initial agreement might not have included clauses about non-payment leading to service termination.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might depend on cultural or community norms. In many cases, people would advise the couple to communicate more directly before taking action. Changing the password without prior notice could be seen as overstepping, hence the author is in the wrong. But if the neighbor is in default and the couple had no other recourse, it might be justified. However, given that it's a neighborly situation and the lack of formal agreement, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A).\n"
