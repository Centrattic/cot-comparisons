I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password because she hasn't been paying the agreed-upon $40 a month. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the setup: the author and their husband set up a second Wi-Fi for the neighbor, and the neighbor agreed to pay $40 a month. Initially, the neighbor paid on time, then started being late, then half payments, and then stopped altogether. The author is considering changing the password until payment is made again.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author mentions that they agreed to provide the internet access in exchange for payment. The neighbor isn't paying, so the author wants to cut off the service. Legally, if there was a verbal agreement, it's still a contract. The neighbor is breaching that contract by not paying. But changing the password could be seen as cutting off service, which might be their right, but there are other factors.\n\nBut here's the catch: the internet is part of the building's service, right? If the author isn't the official provider, they might be using the building's internet themselves. So, providing a separate password might not be a legal right. The author could be violating the neighbor's rights by restricting access if the building's internet is communal. Also, changing the password without notice might be abrupt. The neighbor might have relied on that service, and sudden cutoff could cause inconvenience. \n\nEthically, the author is trying to enforce a payment they're owed. They mention they can afford to lose the money but want to save for a mortgage. However, using a unilateral action like changing the password might not be the best approach. It could lead to conflict or legal issues if the neighbor disputes it. Perhaps the author should have tried formal methods first, like sending a written notice or involving the building management. \n\nThere's also the aspect of how the author is handling the situation. They're not chasing the neighbor for payment, which might be a passive approach. But by changing the password, they're taking a more active step. The neighbor might have a valid reason for not paying, but the author isn't considering that. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's action is a form of self-help. But in many jurisdictions, you can't just stop someone's services without following proper procedures. The author might need to go through legal channels to enforce payment, like small claims court, rather than taking matters into their own hands. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is trying to enforce a payment agreement, but the method they're using (changing the password) might be considered inappropriate or illegal. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
