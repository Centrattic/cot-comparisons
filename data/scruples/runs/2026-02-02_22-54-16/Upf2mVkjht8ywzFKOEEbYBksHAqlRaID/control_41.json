I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password after the neighbor stopped paying. \n\nFirst, there's an agreement between the two parties. The neighbor offered to pay $40/month for internet access, and the couple agreed. The neighbor initially paid on time, then became late, then half-paid, and finally stopped paying. The couple feels they shouldn't have to chase her for payment, even though they can afford it. They want to cut off her access until she pays.\n\nNow, considering the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, changing the password could be seen as cutting off a service they've been providing under an informal agreement. If there's no formal contract, the situation might be a bit murky. Ethically, they might feel justified since they agreed to this arrangement, but taking matters into their own hands by changing the password without a formal agreement might not be the best approach.\n\nAlso, the neighbor's behavior is inconsiderate, but retaliating by disconnecting her could be seen as a form of taking justice into their own hands. They might not have legal standing to enforce payment this way. It's possible that the neighbor could argue breach of the informal agreement, but if there's no written contract, proving that could be difficult.\n\nOn the other hand, the couple isn't in a position where they can legally enforce payment through such means. They might need to involve the landlord or the ISP if the internet is under their name. Changing the password without permission could be considered a breach of the neighbor's reasonable access, especially if the neighbor was a good-faith payer at first.\n\nSo, even if the neighbor isn't paying, the couple's method of enforcing the agreement might not be the right approach. They might be in the wrong because they're using a self-help method that's not legally sanctioned. The proper way would be to communicate again, maybe set up a payment plan, or seek help from a mediator or the landlord. Therefore, the answer is likely A, that they're in the wrong.\n"
