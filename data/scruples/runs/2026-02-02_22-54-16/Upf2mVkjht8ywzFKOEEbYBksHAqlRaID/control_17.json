I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if changing the neighbor's Wi-Fi password is wrong. The setup is that the neighbor offered to pay $40/month for internet access, but she stopped paying. The author is considering revoking access until payment is made.\n\nFirst, agreements between neighbors\u2014especially informal ones\u2014can be tricky. They probably had a verbal agreement where the neighbor pays for the internet. If she agreed to pay and hasn't, the author might have a case. But legally, changing the password could be an issue. Internet service is typically a utility provided by a company, not the individual. If the neighbor is using the author's Wi-Fi, it's unauthorized unless there's a formal agreement. However, the author set up a second connection specifically for her, which might imply a mutual understanding.\n\nBut here's the catch: legally, the author might not have the right to control someone else's access. The neighbor might be using the internet without proper authorization, which could be a legal gray area. If the internet provider's terms don't allow sharing, then the author could be violating those terms by providing access in the first place. Changing the password could escalate the issue, but the root problem is the unpaid debt.\n\nThe author's argument is about respecting boundaries and not chasing money. The neighbor isn't paying, so cutting off access seems like a way to enforce the agreement. However, without a formal contract, it's hard to enforce terms. The author might be justified in wanting payment, but the method of changing the password could be seen as taking matters into their own hands. Legally, the proper step would be to pursue a small claims case or send a formal demand letter. Changing the password might be a violation of the neighbor's rights if she's using it under any terms, even informal ones.\n\nAlso, the author mentions she's not in dire straits but still isn't paying. The author's financial situation allows them to absorb the cost, but they want to save for a mortgage. It's understandable, but the method of enforcing payment is questionable. So, the author might be in the wrong for taking direct action instead of following legal channels. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
