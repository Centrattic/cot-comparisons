I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password because the neighbor stopped paying for the wifi they agreed to pay for.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author and their husband set up a second Wi-Fi connection for their neighbor. The neighbor initially agreed to pay $40/month. At first, she paid on time, then started being late, then paid half upfront and half later, and then stopped paying entirely. The author feels it's unfair to have to chase her for payments, especially since the neighbor seems to have financial means (shopping weekly, bought a new car). The author is saving for a mortgage and doesn't need the money but wants to be paid as agreed. They're considering changing the password until payment is made.\n\nNow, the key points here are whether changing the password is justified. Legally, I'm not sure, but ethically, the author might think they're entitled to enforce the agreement. However, there's a question about mutual consent. When they set up the second Wi-Fi, did they have a formal agreement? If it was just a verbal agreement, enforcing it through such a method might be problematic. Also, cutting off internet access could be seen as a form of retaliation or breach of implied agreement.\n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor isn't fulfilling her part of the deal, and the author is trying to enforce the terms they agreed upon. The author didn't mention confronting the neighbor first about the unpaid bills. Maybe they should have had a discussion before taking action. Changing the password without prior communication might be seen as taking matters into their own hands instead of resolving it through proper channels, like sending a formal request or involving building management if it's an apartment complex.\n\nAdditionally, there's the aspect of privacy and property rights. The author is using their own internet connection, so technically, they can control access. However, the neighbor might have an expectation of continued service if they've been using it up to now. There's also the potential for escalation\u2014what if the neighbor retaliates in some way?\n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The author has a right to be paid for the service they provided, but enforcing it by cutting off access might not be the best approach. A better solution might be to terminate the agreement politely after giving notice, rather than taking a more confrontational step like changing the password without prior communication. The author's approach could be seen as a breach of trust or an act of coercion, which might not be considered appropriate in a community setting.\n\nIn summary, while the neighbor is not following through on her payments, the author's method of enforcing payment might be seen as overstepping. They might have a valid grievance but the action taken could be considered in the wrong because it's a direct and unilateral action without giving the neighbor a chance to respond or resolve the issue through discussion or mediation. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because changing the password without prior communication and using it as a form of payment enforcement could be seen as an aggressive and potentially illegal act, depending on local laws, and not the proper way to handle such disputes.\n"
