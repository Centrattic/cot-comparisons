I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong after changing their neighbor's internet password because the neighbor stopped paying for the shared connection.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The neighbor (a single mom) offered to pay $40/month for internet access. Initially, she paid on time, then was late, then paid half upfront and half later, then stopped paying altogether. The author and their husband agreed to this arrangement, but the neighbor isn't fulfilling her part. The author is considering changing the password to enforce payment.\n\nSo, the key points here are: there was an agreement, the neighbor is not keeping up her end, and the action taken is to revoke access. The question is whether this action is justified.\n\nLegally, if there's a contract or agreement between the two parties, the author might have the right to enforce it. However, in many jurisdictions, intentionally disrupting someone's access to services, even if they're in breach of an agreement, could be seen as a civil matter rather than criminal. But it's more about ethics and social norms here.\n\nEthically, the author might feel wronged because the neighbor isn't paying, and they've been covering the costs. On the other hand, cutting off internet access might be seen as a form of punishment or retaliation. The neighbor might have a legitimate need for internet access, especially as a parent, and doing this could cause inconvenience.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that they're protecting their own resources and enforcing the terms of the agreement. The problem here is whether changing the password is a reasonable and proportionate response. Another angle is that the author could have tried to resolve the issue through communication, mediation, or other means before taking such action.\n\nAlso, considering they're in a shared living situation, maintaining good relations is important. If the author's action leads to further conflict, that could be a problem. But the author might feel justified in protecting their own financial interests and the agreement they made.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might not be in the wrong if there was a mutual agreement and the neighbor is in breach. However, taking unilateral action without trying to resolve it through proper channels could be seen as problematic. The key is whether changing the password is a fair and appropriate way to enforce the agreement.\n\nIn many cases, people might advise sending a warning or requesting payment before cutting off access. Since the author didn't mention trying to communicate again, maybe they should have done that first. But the question is whether they're in the wrong now that they've done it.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the action was a reasonable enforcement of the agreement. If the agreement was clear and the neighbor isn't honoring it, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But some might argue that it's still a harsh move that could be illegal or unethical. However, without legal action, it's more about personal ethics here.\n\nSo, considering all that, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong, as they were trying to enforce a prior agreement. But there's a possible nuance in how they handled it. The answer might be B (No), but I should make sure I haven't missed any key points.\n"
