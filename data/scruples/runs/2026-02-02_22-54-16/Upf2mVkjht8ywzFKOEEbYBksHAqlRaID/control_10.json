I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether changing a neighbor's internet password is wrong in this scenario. The setup is that the neighbor offered to pay $40/month for the internet, but she stopped paying. The author wants to change the password until payment is made.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. The neighbor approached them with the offer, and they agreed. So there's an informal contract here. The neighbor was initially paying but became delinquent. The authors are providing a service (internet) and expect payment. The question is about whether changing the password is a reasonable action when the neighbor isn't fulfilling her part.\n\nLegally, if there's a verbal agreement, the authors might have a claim, but it's hard to enforce. However, in practice, the neighbors are relying on each other without a formal contract. The authors are out of pocket because they're paying for the internet themselves, even though they don't need the money. The neighbor isn't respecting their end of the deal, not even acknowledging the debt when they meet.\n\nEthically, withholding the service (internet) because the neighbor isn't paying could be seen as justified. The authors aren't cutting off utilities in a legal sense, but it's a service they're providing. However, changing the password might be seen as taking matters into their own hands. There's no legal protection here, and the neighbor could potentially retaliate or there might be community issues.\n\nBut the authors are not in a position to enforce payment through legal channels easily. Their options might be limited to stopping the service if the agreement isn't being honored. The fact that the neighbor isn't paying despite having the means (new car, shopping) adds to the frustration. The authors aren't trying to harm, just to collect what's owed.\n\nSo, considering all this, the authors might not be in the wrong because they're enforcing the terms of their agreement. However, changing the password could be considered a form of self-help, which is a gray area. But given the circumstances, they might not be in the wrong. I think the answer is B.\n"
