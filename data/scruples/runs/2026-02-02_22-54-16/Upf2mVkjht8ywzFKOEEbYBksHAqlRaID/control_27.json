I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering changing their neighbor's internet password because the neighbor stopped paying. \n\nFirst, the setup: The neighbor offered to pay $40/month for internet access, and the author agreed. Initially, the neighbor paid, then started being late, then only paid half, and then nothing. The author is frustrated because the neighbor seems to have the means but isn't paying up. They want to cut off the internet by changing the password until payment is made.\n\nSo, the main question is about whether this action is justified. Legally, the author isn't a service provider. The internet is part of their own home setup. By providing the neighbor with a separate Wi-Fi, they created a kind of informal agreement. But if the neighbor isn't paying, can the author cut off access?\n\nIn legal terms, if there's no formal contract, the author might not have the legal standing to enforce payment through such means. However, the neighbor was using the author's property (the Wi-Fi) under an agreement. If the neighbor isn't fulfilling their part, the author could argue that they have the right to revoke access. But using the password change as a method to enforce payment could be seen as a form of coercion or a civil dispute handled inappropriately. \n\nMorally, it's a bit tricky. The neighbor isn't paying as agreed, so the author feels entitled to stop the service. However, cutting off internet access without notice might be seen as taking the law into their own hands. The author could have approached the neighbor directly, sent a formal request, or even taken legal action. Instead, changing the password is a more aggressive action that could be considered a breach of peace or an act of revenge. \n\nAlso, considering that the author mentions they can afford the $40, maybe the issue isn't about the money but about principle. But using such a method could escalate the conflict and lead to more problems, like the neighbor retaliating or legal issues if the neighbor sues for breach of an agreement. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, cutting off someone's internet access without proper notice or legal recourse might not be allowed, especially if it's a shared resource. Since it's an apartment building, maybe the landlord is the one who provides the internet, so the author isn't technically the one providing the service. If the neighbor is using the apartment's Wi-Fi, maybe the author has no right to control it. The setup is a bit unclear, but if the author set up a separate network, they might have control, but that's still a gray area.\n\nOverall, while the neighbor isn't paying as agreed, the author's method of enforcing payment by changing the password might be seen as taking matters into their own hands. The appropriate steps would be to communicate clearly, perhaps send a written notice, and if necessary, involve a mediator or legal system. So, the author might be in the wrong for not following proper procedures and for using a tactic that could be considered coercive or harassing.\n"
