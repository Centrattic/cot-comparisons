I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password because the neighbor stopped paying. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author and their husband set up a second wifi connection for their neighbor, who agreed to pay $40 a month. Initially, the neighbor paid on time, then got late, offered half now half later, and then stopped paying. The author is considering changing the password to make the neighbor pay what's owed. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Legally, if they had an agreement, maybe the neighbor isn't paying. But the author is taking matters into their own hands by changing the password. Is that a valid approach? Well, if there's a contract or some kind of legal agreement, the proper way would be to enforce it through legal means, not just disable the service. But in reality, people don't always go to court for small amounts. \n\nEthically, the author might feel they're justified since they agreed to the arrangement. But taking away the internet could inconvenience someone else, especially a single mom with kids. Also, maybe the neighbor has financial issues now, but the author doesn't know that. The author's argument is that the neighbor isn't in financial trouble because she buys things regularly and got a new car. But maybe the neighbor's circumstances changed.\n\nThe author mentions they can afford to pay the bill themselves but want to save for a mortgage. So it's more about principle. But changing the password could be seen as a form of harassment or retaliation. Legally, the author might not have the right to control someone else's access like that. Plus, if the internet is provided by the building, maybe they're not allowed to set up separate access in the first place. \n\nAlso, the neighbor might have a contract with the internet provider, and the author's setup could be unauthorized. So the author could be violating the neighbor's rights by changing the password. It's a gray area. But generally, disrupting someone's service without legal recourse is probably wrong. The proper approach would be to communicate again, maybe send a formal notice, and if that fails, consider small claims court. Changing the password is more of a personal action, which might not be legally or ethically correct.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're taking unilateral action without following proper legal channels. Even if they feel justified, the method is inappropriate.\n"
