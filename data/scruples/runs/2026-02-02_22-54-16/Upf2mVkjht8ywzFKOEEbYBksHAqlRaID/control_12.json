I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if changing the neighbor's internet password is wrong. They formed an agreement where the neighbor pays $40 a month for internet access. Initially, the neighbor paid on time, but then started being late, paid half, and then stopped altogether. The author is considering changing the password until payment is made.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legality and ethics here. Legally, if there was a formal contract, changing the password might be a breach. But in this case, it's a verbal agreement, which might not hold up legally. However, ethically, the author might feel justified because the neighbor isn't fulfilling her part. But the neighbor might argue that the internet is secondary, and the main service is the building's internet, which the author isn't providing directly. Also, the author is covering the full bill themselves, so perhaps they should handle the payment issue through proper channels, like contacting the ISP or involving building management if applicable. Changing the password could be seen as a form of taking the law into their own hands, which might not be the best approach. The author could have other options, like sending a formal request for payment or involving a mediator. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because there are more appropriate ways to handle the debt without cutting off access unilaterally. Also, the neighbor's children might be affected, which adds an ethical layer. So, the answer would be A.\n"
