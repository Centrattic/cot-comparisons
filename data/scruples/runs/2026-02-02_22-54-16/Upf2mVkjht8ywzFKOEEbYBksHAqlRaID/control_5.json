I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password because the neighbor isn't paying the $40 a month. The situation started with the neighbor offering to pay for a second Wi-Fi connection, and they agreed. Initially, the neighbor paid on time, then got late, then started paying half, and then stopped altogether. The author is considering changing the password until payment is made.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legality and ethics here. Legally, if they set up a second Wi-Fi network and the neighbor is using it, the author might have provided access under an informal agreement. However, changing the password to enforce payment could be a problem. In many places, you can't just cut someone off from a service you provide as a private agreement without some legal framework. It might be a breach of contract if there was an agreement, but if it was just an informal arrangement, it might not be enforceable. But the author might not be aware of that.\n\nEthically, the neighbor isn't paying, and the author is covering the cost, which they can afford but are saving for a mortgage. The neighbor is using the service, so the author might feel they're entitled to the payment. However, changing the password could be seen as a form of self-help, but in some places, this could be considered illegal or a form of harassment. Also, the neighbor might have a counter-claim if the service isn't properly provided, but in this case, the author is the one controlling the service.\n\nAnother angle is the initial agreement. If the neighbor offered the deal and the author agreed, it's their fault for not following through if they didn't set up any formal contract. The author might have trusted the neighbor initially, but the neighbor's behavior is now causing a problem. The author's right to enforce payment depends on whether there was a binding agreement. Without a contract, it might be hard to enforce, and changing the password could be a form of taking matters into their own hands, which might not be the right approach.\n\nAlso, considering the neighbor's situation, they might have financial issues despite appearing to have money. However, the author mentions the neighbor shops weekly and got a new car, suggesting she can afford the $40. The author is not in need of the money but wants to save for a mortgage. The ethical question is whether it's fair to cut someone off from a service they're using, especially if there's no clear agreement. The author might be trying to enforce a verbal agreement, but without legal backing, it's tricky.\n\nIn terms of the answer, the options are A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). Legally, changing the password could be seen as a breach of peace or some other infraction, depending on local laws. Ethically, the author has a right to be paid, but the method of enforcement is questionable. The neighbor's continued use of the service might imply an ongoing agreement, so changing the password is a way to enforce payment, but it's not a legal solution. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not pursuing proper channels, like mediation or small claims court, instead of taking unilateral action. So the answer would be A.\n"
