I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about changing a neighbor's internet password because she hasn't been paying her share. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The couple set up a second Wi-Fi for their neighbor, who agreed to pay $40 a month. Initially, the neighbor paid on time, then started being late, offered half payments, and eventually stopped. The couple isn't desperate for the money but want to save for a mortgage. They're considering changing the password until the neighbor pays up.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's analyze from different angles. Legally, the neighbor is a tenant in the same building, so the couple might not have a formal contract. If there's no written agreement, the neighbor could argue that the setup was informal. However, the neighbor initiated the arrangement and agreed to the terms. The couple provided a service (internet), and the neighbor agreed to pay, so there's an implied contract here. \n\nEthically, the couple isn't in dire need but want their money back. The neighbor has been consistently late, which could be seen as a breach of the agreement. The couple's action of changing the password is a form of enforcing the agreement, but is it justified? They might be taking matters into their own hands instead of going through proper channels. \n\nWhat are the neighbor's rights? If the neighbor is a tenant, she might have the right to internet access if it's part of her lease or if it's considered a necessary service. However, since the couple provided a separate Wi-Fi, it's more of a private arrangement. \n\nPossible consequences: The neighbor could retaliate, legal action might be taken if there's a formal agreement, or the couple could face issues from the building management if they interfere with the neighbor's services. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, disconnecting services without proper legal grounds could be considered harassment or a breach of peace. The couple might need to go through the building's management or involve the internet provider if there's a formal agreement. \n\nSo, while the neighbor isn't paying as agreed, the couple's method of enforcement might be too direct. They should probably send a formal notice, involve the building management, or seek legal advice. Changing the password unilaterally could escalate the situation and might not be legally sound without a contract. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they're taking unilateral action without proper legal recourse.\n"
