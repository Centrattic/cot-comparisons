I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who changed their neighbor's internet password is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor who was paying $40/month for internet access, but then stopped. The author is considering changing the password to enforce payment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. In most places, intentionally disrupting someone's internet access could be illegal. The neighbor paid for the service, so the author might be interfering with their contractual rights. Also, changing someone else's password without consent is unauthorized access, which could be a crime.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. Even if they agreed to the arrangement, the author might be within their rights to stop the service if the neighbor isn't paying. However, they should probably follow proper procedures, like sending a formal notice or involving a mediator. Just cutting off access might be seen as taking the law into their own hands.\n\nThe neighbor's actions: she initially agreed to pay, then stopped. The author's response is to change the password. But maybe the right step would be to first communicate clearly, send a written notice, and if necessary, terminate the service through official means. Changing the password without prior notice might be abrupt and could lead to legal issues if the neighbor sues.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they can afford to pay the bill themselves but want the neighbor to pay. However, the neighbor might have a right to the service if they were set up to share the cost. The author's actions could be seen as a breach of their agreed-upon terms unless they have a written contract allowing them to cut off service for non-payment.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because changing the password could be illegal and ethically wrong without proper procedure. The correct approach would involve formal communication and possibly legal steps if needed.\n"
