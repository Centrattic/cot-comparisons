I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password because the neighbor hasn't been paying. \n\nFirst, the setup: The neighbors offered to pay $40 a month for internet access. Initially, payments were on time, then became inconsistent. Now, the neighbor isn't paying at all, but they don't seem to be in financial trouble. The author wants to cut off the neighbor's access until the debt is settled.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, I don't see a formal contract here. It was an informal agreement. If there's no contract, the author might not have legal recourse. But the question is about moral wrong, not legal. \n\nMoral considerations: The neighbor agreed to pay but isn't. The author is using the neighbor's internet under an agreement. If the agreement is broken, the author has a right to enforce terms. However, changing the password could be seen as taking the law into their own hands. The neighbor might have a right to expect continued service if the agreement isn't formal. Also, the author is in a position where they can afford the internet, so maybe they have the leverage. But is it right to withhold something the neighbor is using under an agreement? If the neighbor agreed to pay and isn't, maybe the author isn't wrong to enforce the agreement. However, some might argue that it's better to resolve this through communication or involving the internet provider. Also, there's a power dynamic here; being in a small apartment complex could mean social consequences if they cut off the neighbor. But the author's need to save for a mortgage is a valid point. \n\nSo, balancing these factors, the author's action could be seen as a reasonable enforcement of an agreement, especially since the neighbor isn't in dire straits. Therefore, the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
