I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password after she stopped paying. The situation involves a small apartment building where the couple set up a second Wi-Fi for the neighbor, who initially paid but then became delinquent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical implications. Legally, sharing your internet password allows others to use your service, which is typically a violation of the service provider's terms of service. By changing the password, the author is enforcing their own rules, but did they have a formal agreement? The neighbor offered the arrangement, and the couple agreed. However, the terms might not be legally binding. If the neighbor is using the internet without proper authorization now, the author could be liable for her usage, which might be a problem.\n\nEthically, the neighbor isn't paying as agreed, which the author finds frustrating. They've been covering the cost themselves, which is understandable, but cutting off the internet could affect the neighbor, especially if she's a single mom. There's a question of fairness\u2014while the author isn't in need of the money, the neighbor's actions are a breach of their informal agreement. However, changing the password without discussing it first might be seen as a harsh measure. The author could have addressed the issue through communication, maybe setting clear expectations or ending the arrangement properly.\n\nAlso, the neighbor's use of the internet might be affecting the author's own usage, like bandwidth. But the author hasn't mentioned any issues with that. The main point is about the payment. The couple has the right to protect their property and set terms, but using a password change as a means of enforcement could be seen as taking the law into their own hands. They might be within their rights to stop the arrangement, but doing so abruptly without warning or a formal agreement could lead to complications.\n\nIn some places, unauthorized users could be considered a security risk, so changing the password might be necessary from a safety standpoint. But if the neighbor was using it with the author's initial consent, even if it's now unpaid, there could be a different perspective. The key is whether there was a mutual agreement that included consequences for non-payment. Since there's no mention of a written contract, it's likely an informal understanding.\n\nOverall, while the author is frustrated and wants to enforce the terms they agreed to, the act of changing the password without prior discussion might be seen as going too far. It's a gray area, but ethically, the author is not entirely in the wrong because the neighbor broke the agreement. However, the better approach would have been to communicate and resolve the issue amicably first. Legally, there could be issues, but the question seems more about social acceptability. The title \"WIBTA\" (Would I Be Terrible for doing this?) is about social judgment, so the answer might lean towards B, but depends on context. Given that the author is trying to uphold an agreement, maybe B is correct.\n"
