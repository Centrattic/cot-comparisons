I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after changing their neighbor's internet password because the neighbor stopped paying. \n\nFirst, the situation: The neighbor offered to pay $40/month for the Wi-Fi, and the author agreed. Initially, the neighbor paid on time, then got late, then paid half now/half later, and then stopped altogether. The author is considering changing the password until the debt is paid.\n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, sharing your Wi-Fi and charging for it isn't a formal contract. There's no legal enforceability here. So if the neighbor stops paying, the author might not have a legal case. But the question is about moral or social wrong, not legal. \n\nMoral-wise, the neighbor broke the agreement. The author set up the Wi-Fi for payment, and the neighbor isn't honoring that. The author is trying to enforce the agreement. However, changing the password could be seen as cutting off a service that the neighbor relies on, especially since the author mentions the neighbor has the means to pay. \n\nBut the author is also not in a position where they need the money desperately. They can afford to pay the bill themselves. So is it right to cut off the internet as a form of payment? It might be seen as a harsh measure. The neighbor might need the internet for work or other important reasons. Also, the author didn't mention trying to communicate again before taking action. Maybe they should have reminded the neighbor or set clearer terms first.\n\nOn the other hand, the author made an agreement, and the neighbor isn't fulfilling their part. The author isn't wrong for wanting to enforce the agreement. However, taking unilateral action like changing the password could be seen as taking the law into their own hands. Maybe a better approach would be to confront the neighbor and ask for the payment again, or even cut off access more formally if they don't comply, but not just changing the password without notice.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they changed the password without prior communication, maybe. But if they've tried to get the neighbor to pay and failed, then it's more of a gray area. But overall, taking the password away as a form of payment might be considered harsh, even if the neighbor is at fault. It's a bit of a conflict between enforcing an agreement and being reasonable. The answer might lean towards 'A' (the author is in the wrong) because they're using a service to collect a debt without proper communication or legal backing. Alternatively, if they've tried to communicate and the neighbor refused, then maybe 'B'. But the scenario doesn't mention prior attempts beyond initial agreement. So probably 'A'.\n"
