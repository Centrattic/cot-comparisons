I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password. The situation involves a neighbor who was given a second Wi-Fi connection for $40/month but stopped paying, and the author wants to cut off their access until payment is made.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the agreement between the two parties. The neighbor initiated the offer, and the author agreed. When the neighbor started missing payments, the author didn't chase them but eventually decided to change the password. The key points here are: was there a formal agreement? If it was a verbal agreement, how enforceable is that? Also, is cutting off access a legal and ethical response?\n\nLegally, the author might be within their rights if they set up the Wi-Fi as a service with conditions. However, if the neighbor wasn't officially a subscriber through the service provider, the author might not have a legal obligation to provide the Wi-Fi. But ethically, taking such action without prior notice or discussion could be seen as harsh. The author didn't mention trying to communicate the issue first, just changed the password. That might come off as confrontational without giving the neighbor a chance to explain or pay.\n\nAlso, the author mentions not needing the money but wanting to save for a mortgage. The neighbor's non-payment could be seen as a breach of the mutual agreement. However, the author's decision to cut off access unilaterally might not be the best approach. Maybe sending a formal notice or discussing the matter first would be better. Changing the password could lead to conflict, especially if the neighbor relies on the internet and wasn't given prior warning.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author set up the Wi-Fi for a fee, so expecting payment makes sense. But cutting off access without prior communication might be seen as overstepping. The neighbor might have their reasons for not paying, like financial issues not visible to the author. The author's assumption that the neighbor has money (based on shopping habits and a new car) might not be accurate; maybe the neighbor has other expenses or debts.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't communicate the issue first and took a direct action that could be seen as hostile. It's possible the neighbor is in the wrong for not paying, but the author's method of addressing it could be problematic. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they acted without proper communication and potentially escalated the situation without giving the neighbor a chance to resolve the payment issue.\n"
