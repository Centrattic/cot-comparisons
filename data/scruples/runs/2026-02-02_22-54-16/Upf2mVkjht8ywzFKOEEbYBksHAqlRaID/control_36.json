I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this \"Will I Be The Asshole\" (WIBTA) scenario is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their husband live in an apartment building. A neighbor, a single mom, asked them to set up a second Wi-Fi connection in exchange for $40/month. Initially, the neighbor paid on time, but then started being late, offered to pay half now and half later, and then stopped paying altogether. The author mentions that the neighbor seems to have money (shopping frequently, bought a new car) but doesn't bring up the payments when they meet. The author is considering changing the Wi-Fi password until the neighbor pays what's owed. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's start by looking at the agreements. The neighbor approached them with the offer, and they agreed. That's an informal agreement, not a legal contract. But in such situations, people often expect that if you agree to a service for a fee, the service is provided until the fee is paid. However, the author is considering cutting off the Wi-Fi as a way to enforce payment. \n\nNow, in many places, intentionally disrupting someone's access to services they are paying for might be legally questionable. But in this case, the neighbor isn't a customer of the author's internet service; the author is the one providing the service. The author is not a telecom provider, so they might not have the legal right to terminate the service they are providing to someone else, especially if there's no formal agreement. \n\nHowever, the moral aspect is tricky. The author is providing a service (Wi-Fi) for a fee, and the neighbor isn't paying. The author is trying to enforce the terms of their agreement. But in many communities, neighbors often have informal agreements, and sometimes those agreements are broken. The question is whether using the Wi-Fi password as a way to pressure payment is fair or considered wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel they have the right to withhold the service if the neighbor isn't paying. On the other hand, changing the password could be seen as a form of coercion or harassment, especially if the neighbor is now being denied a service they were using without upfront payment. The author might be taking matters into their own hands instead of addressing the issue through more formal means, like mediation or even legal action if there's a contract. \n\nAlso, the neighbor's behavior is problematic\u2014stopping payments without communication. The author could have first tried to address the issue directly, remind the neighbor of the agreement, maybe set up a payment plan. By changing the password, the author is taking a unilateral action that could escalate the conflict. \n\nLegally, in some places, such actions could be considered a breach of the agreement, but without a formal contract, it's hard to say. Morally, the author might be justified in wanting to stop the service if it's not being paid for, but others might see it as an overreaction or an inappropriate use of personal power over a neighbor. \n\nSo the answer hinges on whether the author's action is seen as a reasonable enforcement of the agreement or as a harsh and unfair response. The community's perspective on WIBTA often leans towards considering the intentions and communication. Since the author didn't mention trying to resolve it through direct communication first, maybe they should have done that. Changing the password could be seen as the asshole move if it's done without discussion, as it's cutting off something the neighbor was relying on without giving them a chance to explain or pay. \n\nAlso, the neighbor might not have the technical means to access the internet otherwise, so this could be a significant inconvenience. The author's argument is that they can afford to lose the money, but they want the neighbor to honor the agreement. However, using the Wi-Fi as leverage could be seen as using a personal power move, which is a common theme in WIBTA where the answer is often \"yes\" if someone takes unilateral action without proper communication or legal standing.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because changing the password without proper communication or a formal agreement could be seen as an asshole move. The answer is A."
