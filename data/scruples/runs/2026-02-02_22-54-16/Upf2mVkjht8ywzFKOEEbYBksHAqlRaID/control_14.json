I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for considering changing their neighbor's Wi-Fi password after she stopped paying. \n\nFirst, there's the initial agreement. The neighbor offered to pay $40 a month for internet access, and the author and husband agreed. That's a contractual agreement, even if informal. The neighbor started paying on time, then got late, then paid half now and half later, and then stopped altogether. \n\nThe author feels that the neighbor isn't in a financial hardship since she can afford a new car and frequent shopping. The author is upset because they're covering the cost themselves, even though they can afford it, but they're saving for a mortgage. They\u2019re considering cutting off the neighbor's access by changing the password until payment is made.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the neighbor's breach of the agreed-upon terms, the author's attempt to enforce payment through removing access, and whether this action is justified.\n\nLegally, if there's no formal contract, it's a bit tricky. The neighbor isn't legally bound unless there's a written agreement. However, in terms of ethics and social norms, the author might feel that enforcing the terms they agreed upon is fair. But changing the password could be seen as taking matters into their own hands, which might be considered a form of retaliation or an overstep. The neighbor might have other ways to get internet, but it's the author's property and their right to control access. However, if the neighbor isn't a tenant and the internet access wasn't part of their lease agreement, it's a private arrangement. \n\nBut there's a risk here. If the neighbor is using a public network or it's considered a shared space, there might be different considerations. However, in this case, it's an apartment building where they installed a second Wi-Fi specifically for the neighbor. So the author provided that service under the condition of payment. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for wanting payment, but changing the password could be seen as cutting off a service that the neighbor might rely on, even if it's an informal agreement. However, if the agreement was clear and the neighbor is breaching it, then the author has the right to enforce the terms. The problem is that without a formal contract, the author's options might be limited to legal remedies, like sending a demand letter or going to small claims court. Changing the password is a self-help measure that might be considered justified in some contexts but could also be seen as inconsiderate or harsh, especially if it affects the neighbor's ability to work or access essential services. \n\nIn terms of social norms, the author might be justified in their frustration, but the method of enforcement could be seen as extreme. The neighbor might also have the right to access the internet through other means, so the impact on her isn't as severe. But the author's actions could be perceived as taking unilateral action without giving the neighbor a chance to resolve the debt through proper channels. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B), as they have a right to enforce payment under their agreement. However, it's a bit of a grey area because the method of enforcement could be considered overly harsh. But since the author isn't causing physical harm or blocking essential services beyond the internet, and the neighbor isn't a tenant in a formal sense, the author's actions might be seen as justified in the context of their own property.\n"
