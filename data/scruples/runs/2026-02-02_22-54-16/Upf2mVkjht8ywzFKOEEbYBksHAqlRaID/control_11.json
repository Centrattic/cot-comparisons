I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about changing a neighbor's internet password because she stopped paying for the service they provided. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The neighbors offered internet access for $40 a month, which the single mom initially paid but then started being late and eventually stopped. The author and her husband are covering the cost themselves but don't want to chase the money since they're saving for a mortgage. They're considering changing the password to enforce payment.\n\nNow, the question is whether this action is wrong. Legally, if there was a prior agreement, the person is in breach by not paying. However, cutting off internet access might be a breach of contract too if they agreed to provide the service in exchange for payment. But in practice, maybe they didn't have a formal contract. \n\nEthically, they're trying to enforce a payment they're owed. The neighbor isn't paying, so the author might feel justified. But changing the password without notice could be seen as a harsh move. It's a private good (internet access), so controlling access is their right. However, there might be a better way to handle it, like sending a written notice or involving the landlord. \n\nBut the core issue is whether they have the right to deny service when the neighbor hasn't paid. If they set up the second Wi-Fi as part of an agreement, then requiring payment is reasonable. However, doing it abruptly could be seen as taking the law into their own hands. Maybe they should have documented the agreement or used a more formal method to request payment first. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because they're enforcing a mutual agreement. But there could be a more appropriate way. However, the question is if they're in the wrong. Since the neighbor is breaching the agreement by not paying, changing the password could be a reasonable step. But maybe the author should have given more formal notice first. However, the scenario doesn't mention that, so maybe they feel it's time to take action. \n\nI think the answer is B (No) because they're protecting their own resources and enforcing an agreement they had. It's a bit of a gray area, but if they provided a service and the neighbor agreed to pay, then denying access when the payment isn't made isn't necessarily wrong. The neighbor is the one in the wrong for not paying. So the author is just taking a stand.\n"
