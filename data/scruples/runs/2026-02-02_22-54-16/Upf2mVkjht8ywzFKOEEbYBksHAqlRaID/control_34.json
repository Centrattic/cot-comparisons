I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering changing their neighbor's internet password if she stops paying. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The writer and her husband set up a second Wi-Fi connection for their neighbor, who agreed to pay $40 a month. The neighbor initially paid on time but then became late and eventually stopped paying altogether. The writer is considering changing the password until the neighbor pays up.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether changing the password is a justified action given the neighbor's non-payment. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, there was an agreement. The neighbor approached them with the offer, and they agreed to the terms. The neighbor started paying but then didn't continue. The writer and husband are out of pocket, even though they can afford it, but they have financial goals like saving for a mortgage. \n\nNow, the question is about right or wrong. Legally, if they have an agreement, the neighbor might be in breach by not paying. But the writer is considering taking matter into their own hands by changing the password. Is that acceptable?\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, changing someone else's access could be seen as interfering with their property or services. Even if the neighbor isn't paying, the writer might not have the right to cut off the service. The proper legal recourse would be to pursue through small claims court or another legitimate process. Taking unilateral action could be problematic.\n\nMoral and ethical aspects: The writer is frustrated because the neighbor isn't following through on the agreement. They feel it's unfair to continue providing service without payment. However, cutting off the internet could be considered a form of punishment or retaliation. It might also be seen as reasonable if the agreement was clear and mutual. The writer might feel they have the right to enforce the terms they agreed upon.\n\nAnother angle: The neighbor isn't actively hiding the fact that she can't pay; in fact, she's seen buying things and got a new car. This could imply she's not in financial hardship, making the situation seem more like willful non-payment. The writer's action is a way to hold her accountable, but is it the right approach?\n\nPossible counterarguments: Changing the password could cause inconvenience to the neighbor, especially if she's a single mom with children. It might also escalate tensions between neighbors. Additionally, if the internet is part of a shared system, the writer might not have control over it, depending on how the setup is managed.\n\nIn terms of social norms, some people might think the writer is justified in enforcing the agreement, while others might say they should handle it through legal means instead of taking matters into their own hands. The phrase \"WIBTA\" (Would I Be Terrible for...) suggests the writer is seeking moral approval rather than legal advice.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The writer is in a tough spot. Legally, they might not have the right to cut off the service without going through proper channels. Morally, there's room for both sides\u2014some might see it as fair, others as overstepping. But typically, in these types of scenarios, the correct approach is to resolve disputes through legal means, not personal enforcement. Therefore, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because they're taking unilateral action instead of following proper procedures.\n"
