I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering changing their neighbor's Wi-Fi password. The situation involves a neighbor who agreed to pay $40/month for internet access, but has stopped paying. The author is contemplating cutting off access until payment is made.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a legal aspect here. In most places, if you're providing a service like internet access, you can set terms for payment. However, if the neighbor isn't a formal tenant or under a legal agreement, there might be issues. The original setup was a private agreement between neighbors, so there's no formal lease or contract. Legally, the author might not have a strong case to enforce payment through such a method as changing the password. But that's not the main point here\u2014the question is about morality, not legality.\n\nEthically, the author is frustrated because the neighbor isn't following through on an agreement. They provided a service (internet) in exchange for money, and the neighbor isn't upholding their end. The author isn't in need of the money but is saving for a mortgage. The neighbor, however, seems to have the means to pay, as indicated by the car and shopping. The author feels it's unfair to have to chase payments and wants to enforce the agreement.\n\nChanging the Wi-Fi password could be seen as cutting off a necessary service, which might be harsh. However, the author provided the service under the condition of payment. If the neighbor isn't paying, the author has a right to stop the service. But since it's a neighborly arrangement, there's an expectation of good faith. The author might be justified in stopping the service once the neighbor defaults on payments, especially since they've tried to collect and the neighbor ignores it.\n\nOn the flip side, cutting off Wi-Fi could inconvenience the neighbor, especially if they have children. But the neighbor chose to enter into the agreement knowing the terms. The author isn't cutting off something like electricity or water, just internet access. It's a service they provided, so revoking it when payment isn't made might be fair.\n\nBut there's a nuance here. The initial agreement was made when the internet was installed. If the neighbor isn't paying, the author could argue they're not bound to continue providing the service. However, in a small community, such actions might affect relationships. The author might be right in enforcing the agreement, but they should consider communication first. Maybe sending a formal notice or reminder before taking action. Still, the question is whether the action of changing the password is wrong. Since the neighbor isn't paying, the author might not be in the wrong for enforcing the terms they agreed to. So the answer is likely B (No).\n"
