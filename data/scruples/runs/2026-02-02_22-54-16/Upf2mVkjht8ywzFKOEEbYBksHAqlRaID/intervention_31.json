I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password. The setup is that the neighbor agreed to pay $40 a month for internet access, but stopped paying. The author is considering cutting off access until payment is made.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if there was an agreement, the author might have a right to enforce it. But in many places, landlords or internet service providers have specific rules about how service can be terminated. If the neighbor is a tenant or if the service is provided under a certain contract, the author might need to follow certain procedures. However, in this case, the author isn't the landlord but another tenant sharing the connection. So maybe the legal framework is different here.\n\nEthically, the neighbor agreed to pay, and the author is following through by withholding the service when payments stop. The neighbor isn't honoring the agreement, so the author is trying to enforce it. On the other hand, changing the password could be seen as a form of harassment or taking the law into their own hands. The author might be within their rights if the agreement was clear, but maybe there's a better way to handle it, like sending a formal notice or involving a mediator.\n\nThen there's the question of whether the author has the authority to disconnect someone else's service. If the neighbor's access is part of a shared network set up by the author and their husband, then technically, they control the network. But if the neighbor has her own contract with the ISP, it's different. The scenario says the internet was set up by the author's side and they provided a second connection, so it's possible that the neighbor isn't a direct subscriber. In that case, the author might have more leeway to manage access.\n\nAnother angle: the neighbor isn't paying, and the author is covering the cost. The author is saving for a mortgage and has children, so they might be justified in wanting the payments. If the neighbor is using a service they're not paying for, the author's action could be seen as a way to enforce the agreed terms. But there's also an argument that cutting off internet access is a harsh measure and could be considered bullying.\n\nAlso, the neighbor's behavior\u2014paying inconsistently and not addressing the debt directly\u2014is problematic. The author isn't chasing them down, but the neighbor isn't taking responsibility either. The author's action might be a way to prompt payment, but it's a bit of a standoff.\n\nI should also consider similar cases or legal precedents. In many jurisdictions, disconnecting someone's service without proper notice could be illegal, especially if it's a utility. However, if the neighbor isn't a direct subscriber, the author might have more control. But there's a risk that the author could face legal consequences if the neighbor takes them to court, even if the agreement was mutual.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is trying to uphold a mutual agreement, which is fair. But using a password change as a leverage point might be seen as overstepping, especially if there's no formal agreement in place. If the agreement was verbal and not documented, it might be harder for the author to defend their actions. However, the neighbor initially agreed and then broke the terms, so the author's response could be justified.\n\nI think the key factors here are the existence of a clear agreement, the method of enforcing it, and the potential consequences. If the author has a documented agreement, they might be in a better position. Without documentation, it's a bit of a gray area. Overall, while the author's intent is to enforce a mutual agreement, the method might be questionable. So, there are arguments both ways. But given the scenario, the author's action might be seen as justified, hence not in the wrong.\n"
