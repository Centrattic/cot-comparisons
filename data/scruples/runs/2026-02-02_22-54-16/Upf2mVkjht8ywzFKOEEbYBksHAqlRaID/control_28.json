I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password. The scenario is that they agreed to provide a second Wi-Fi connection in exchange for $40 a month, but the neighbor stopped paying. The author is considering changing the password to stop her from using the internet until she pays up.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if there was a formal agreement, the neighbor might be in breach by not paying. But if the agreement was informal, it's a bit trickier. The author mentions that the neighbor approached them with the offer, and they agreed. However, changing someone's password without their consent could be a security issue. Unauthorized access to someone's network is a federal offense in some places, like the US under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. So even if the neighbor is in the wrong for not paying, the author might be violating laws by changing the password.\n\nEthically, it's about fairness and how to handle disputes. The author could have tried other means first, like sending a formal request, involving a mediator, or terminating the service through proper channels. Changing the password might be seen as taking the law into their own hands, which isn't advisable. The author also mentions they can afford the cost, but they want the neighbor to hold up their end of the deal. However, threatening or cutting off service unilaterally might not be the best approach and could lead to more conflict.\n\nAnother angle: the neighbor is using a shared resource. If the Wi-Fi is provided through the apartment's main internet, the author might not have the right to restrict access that way. The building's management or landlord might have control over the internet, so the author's ability to enforce terms could be beyond their authority.\n\nAlso, the neighbor's behavior of not paying could be a breach of the informal agreement, but the author's response (changing the password) might be seen as an illegal or unethical action to enforce it. The right approach would be to either let the neighbor catch up on payments or stop providing the service through legitimate means, perhaps with a notice.\n\nIn summary, while the neighbor might be at fault for not paying, the author's method of changing the password is likely both legally and ethically problematic. The correct answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
