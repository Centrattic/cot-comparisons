I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is about changing a neighbor's internet password because she's not paying a shared bill.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The original poster (OP) and her husband agreed to let the neighbor have a second Wi-Fi connection for $40/month. The neighbor initially paid but then started being late, then paid half, then stopped altogether. The OP wants to change the password until payment is received.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether this action is justified. Legally, maybe there's a problem because the neighbor might have a contract or agreement. If they set up the Wi-Fi as part of an oral agreement, the neighbor might be in breach by not paying. But the OP's action of changing the password could be considered a breach of that agreement as well, since they provided the service under an agreement that included payment.\n\nEthically, it's about fairness. The OP is trying to enforce the terms of their agreement. But taking away the service without notice or legal process could be seen as harsh. Also, the neighbor might have her own reasons for not paying, like financial difficulties, even if the OP thinks she can afford it. The OP could have approached it by sending a formal notice or terminating the agreement properly instead of just cutting off service.\n\nAnother angle: the internet service is likely under the OP's name. If the neighbor was allowed to use it as a courtesy, the OP can revoke that access at any time. However, if there was a formal agreement, the OP might need to follow certain steps. Since the neighbor didn't pay, the OP has grounds to end the arrangement, but changing the password without notice might not be the best approach.\n\nAlso, the OP mentions they can afford the payments but want to save for a mortgage. It's their money, but the neighbor's non-payment is a breach. However, the method of response (changing the password) might be seen as a form of self-help that could lead to conflict. It might be better to communicate directly, send a written notice, or involve an intermediary.\n\nIn terms of \"wrongdoing,\" the OP isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to enforce the agreement. But the method of enforcement could be questionable. Changing the password without notice could be seen as overstepping, especially if there's no prior agreement on consequences for non-payment. The neighbor might argue they were relying on the Wi-Fi, and cutting it off could be disruptive. Legally, the OP might need to terminate the agreement properly, perhaps in writing, before cutting off access.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical aspects, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because the method of enforcement is abrupt and lacks proper communication. Even if the neighbor is breaching the agreement, the OP should follow a more formal process. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
