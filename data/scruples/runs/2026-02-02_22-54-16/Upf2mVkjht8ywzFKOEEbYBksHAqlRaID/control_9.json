I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if changing the neighbor's internet password is wrong. The situation is that the neighbor agreed to pay $40 a month for internet access, but started missing payments and now owes money. The author wants to cut off the internet until payment is made.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. The neighbor approached them with the offer, and they agreed. So there's a contract-like agreement here. When the neighbor stopped paying, the authors are within their rights to stop the service, right? Because if you don't pay, you shouldn't get the service. But wait, the internet isn't their own\u2014it's part of the apartment's setup. So maybe they're using the landlord's internet and just sharing a portion. If that's the case, changing the password could be interfering with the landlord's property or violating building rules.\n\nAlso, legally, if there's a verbal agreement, there might be some expectations. But in practice, changing the password without notice could be seen as a breach of their original agreement. Plus, depending on where they are, there might be laws about interfering with another person's access to utilities or services, even if it's a shared one.\n\nAnother angle: the neighbor isn't paying, so the authors aren't getting their money. But if the internet is a shared resource, they can't unilaterally decide to cut someone off. They might need to go through proper channels, like contacting the landlord or maybe even sending a formal notice before changing the password. Acting on their own could be considered harassment or a breach of privacy if they change the password without the landlord's approval.\n\nAlso, the authors mention they can afford the payments but want to save for a mortgage. But the neighbor's non-payment is a breach of their agreement. However, the method of enforcement matters. Changing the password might be a form of retaliation rather than a legal or proper response. They might need to send a written notice first, give a final warning, and then proceed to disconnect, perhaps through the landlord or service provider.\n\nIn summary, while the neighbor isn't paying as agreed, the authors' method of cutting off service might not follow proper procedures. They should probably handle it through the appropriate channels rather than taking matters into their own hands. So the answer might be A (they are in the wrong) because they're acting without proper authority or process.\n"
