I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's Wi-Fi password after the neighbor stopped paying the agreed-upon $40/month. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their husband set up a second Wi-Fi connection for the neighbor, who approached them with the offer. Initially, the neighbor paid, but then started missing payments. Now, the author is considering cutting off access by changing the password until the neighbor pays up.\n\nSo, the main question is whether this action is justified or not. Let's break it down.\n\nLegally, I'm not sure. But from a moral or ethical standpoint, there's an agreement between the two parties. The neighbor agreed to pay $40/month for the internet access. The author provided the service, and the neighbor wasn't upholding their end of the bargain. The author is frustrated because the neighbor isn't proactive about paying and the author doesn't want to chase them. \n\nThe author mentions they can afford the money, but they're saving for a mortgage and have kids. So it's not about the money, but about the principle of the agreement. The neighbor, however, is using the service without paying. \n\nChanging the password is a way to enforce the agreement. But is that ethical? Well, the original agreement was that the neighbor pays for the service. If they stop paying, the author has the right to stop the service. However, the author is using their own internet connection and password. By changing the password, the neighbor can't access the service anymore. \n\nBut here's a catch: the neighbor's access is part of the author's own Wi-Fi. If the author changes the password, the neighbor can't connect, but maybe the author's own usage isn't affected. But does the author have the right to control that? Since the neighbor was using the same network, the author can set terms. So if the neighbor agreed to pay for access, the author can revoke access if the neighbor doesn't pay. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of conflict resolution. Maybe the author should have addressed the payment issue directly first, like sending a reminder, maybe even giving a warning before cutting off. But in the scenario, the neighbor isn't acknowledging the debt. The author might feel that without direct communication, the neighbor isn't going to pay, so changing the password is a way to force them to take action. \n\nBut is this considered in the wrong? If the author had a prior agreement, and the neighbor is violating it by not paying, then the author is just enforcing the terms. However, some might argue that cutting off access is a bit harsh, but given the neighbor's inaction, maybe it's justified. \n\nAnother angle: the author is not in the wrong because they had an agreement. The neighbor is the one who broke it. The author is taking a reasonable step to stop a breach of that agreement. Alternatively, others might say that the author should have handled it through more direct means, but the action itself might not make them wrong. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the neighbor isn't in financial trouble, so it's not like the neighbor can't pay. The neighbor's actions seem willful, which could support the author's decision. \n\nIn the context of the \"WIBTA\" (Would I Be Termed A...] forum, people often discuss such scenarios. Typically, if there's a mutual agreement and one party breaches it, the other can take reasonable steps. Changing the password is a non-violent, proportional response. \n\nTherefore, the author is likely not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
