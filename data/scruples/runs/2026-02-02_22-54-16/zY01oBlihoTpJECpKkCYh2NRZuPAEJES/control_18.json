I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to bring her cat when they move in together. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author is a dog person and has a strong dislike for cats. He's clear about his feelings towards cats, citing their aloofness, the effort required to train them, and past negative experiences with scratches and bites. His girlfriend has a cat, which he finds problematic. He's considered the future of their relationship, including marriage, but the cat's presence is a deal-breaker for him.\n\nHe tried to discuss this with his girlfriend, suggesting the cat could stay with her parents. She responded by saying they're a \"package deal\" and turned cold. When he calmly explained his issues, she gave an ultimatum: either they both move in with him and the cat, or they break up. The author is now considering using a similar hardball tactic by saying she can't move in until the cat is rehomed.\n\nNow, considering if he's in the wrong. Relationships require compromise, but both parties should respect each other's boundaries. The author has valid reasons rooted in his personal experiences and preferences. However, his stance is firm, and he's contemplating using an ultimatum similar to his girlfriend's. The question is whether his position is justifiable.\n\nOn one hand, the author is honest about his dislike for cats and has made a clear request for the cat not to be in their new home. On the other hand, the girlfriend is equally firm, valuing her cat's presence. The key here is whether his decision is unreasonable. Since he's the one setting a boundary for his own home, it's his right to decide what animals live there. However, using a hard ultimatum might come off as equally harsh, but if she's already given an ultimatum, he's just mirroring her approach.\n\nThe ethical standpoint here is tricky. The author's feelings are valid, but the way he's responding (playing hardball) might be seen as unfair if the issue is significant enough for him. However, given that the girlfriend has already made her position non-negotiable, the author is asserting his own boundaries. Therefore, he's not necessarily in the wrong.\n"
