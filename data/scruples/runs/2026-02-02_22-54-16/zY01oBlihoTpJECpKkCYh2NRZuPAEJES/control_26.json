I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is a dog person and has strong negative feelings towards cats. He's had bad experiences with scratches, bites, and the cat's behavior. He does love his girlfriend and envisions a future together, but the cat is a deal-breaker for him. He's tried to discuss it calmly, suggesting alternatives like the cat living with her parents, but she's responded with an ultimatum.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's cat is part of her life. She might see the cat as a pet she's responsible for, not just an inconvenience. Her response was firm, indicating that she's not willing to compromise on this issue. \n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is wrong. In relationships, mutual respect and compromise are key. The author has valid reasons based on his preferences and past experiences. However, his stance is that he won't move in unless the cat is rehomed. The girlfriend's response was also a hardline stance. \n\nIs the author wrong for holding his ground? Well, he's being honest about his feelings, which is important. But relationships require negotiation. If he's unwilling to find a middle ground, that could be problematic. However, if the girlfriend is also unwilling to meet him halfway, she's part of the problem. \n\nThe author's plan to play hardball by saying she can't move in until the cat is rehomed is a strong move, but if he's been clear and she's not budged, he's not necessarily in the wrong. It's about whether he's being reasonable. Since he's made compromises (suggesting the cat go to her parents), and she's not budging, his position might be justified. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the answer leans towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's being honest and has tried to find solutions, even if the outcome is a tough decision.\n"
