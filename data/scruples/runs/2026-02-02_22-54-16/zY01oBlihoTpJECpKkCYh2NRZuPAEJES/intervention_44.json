I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong when he doesn't want his girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in. \n\nFirst, the author is a dog person and has strong negative feelings towards cats. He mentions that he's had bad experiences with cats, finding them unaffectionate and disruptive. His girlfriend, who he's in a serious relationship with, has a cat that's not problematic but he finds very irritating. He's considering moving in together and is clear that he doesn't want the cat. When he's tried to discuss it, his girlfriend has been rigid, even giving an ultimatum about breaking up if he doesn't accept the cat.\n\nNow, to assess if he's in the wrong. From a fairness perspective, having a pet is a personal choice, and if the cat is well-behaved, the girlfriend might feel it's part of her life that he should accept. However, the author has valid reasons based on his experiences and his dog's potential reaction. The key points are mutual respect and compromise. If the girlfriend is unwilling to find a solution that doesn't involve the author's comfort and well-being, that could be an issue. But the author's stance is about his own living conditions and his dog's safety. \n\nSince the girlfriend is holding the relationship hostage with an ultimatum, it might suggest that she's not open to negotiation. However, the author's request is about his own home, so he's not necessarily in the wrong for not wanting to live with a pet he dislikes. The question is whether his refusal is unreasonable. If the cat is manageable and she's not asking him to take on extra care, but just to tolerate it, then he might be expected to adjust. But considering his strong feelings and the potential conflict (with his dog), it's a valid concern. \n\nIn many relationships, finding middle ground is essential. However, if the author's refusal is a deal-breaker for her, maybe the problem lies in her inflexibility. But the author's stance is about his own home and comfort. So, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong because he's setting boundaries about his living space.\n"
