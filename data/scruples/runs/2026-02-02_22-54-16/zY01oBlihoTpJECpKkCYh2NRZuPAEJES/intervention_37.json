I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about him not wanting his girlfriend to bring her cat when they move in together. He's a dog person and can't stand cats, and the girlfriend is being very firm about it.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's reasons: he's been clear about not liking cats, has valid reasons (scratches, the cat's behavior, etc.), and he's thinking about their future living together. He's tried to discuss it but the girlfriend reacted coldly and gave an ultimatum. The question is whether he's in the wrong if he sets a boundary by saying no cat, even if it means a breakup.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that the cat is part of her life and she's not willing to compromise. She might see the cat as a pet and not just an inconvenience. Her reaction could be from feeling that her needs aren't respected, especially if she's been with the cat longer or has emotional attachment.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships require compromise. If both parties can't meet in the middle, it's a tough spot. But the author is standing his ground on something that's a deal-breaker for him. The girlfriend is also firm, which could indicate that the cat is important to her. However, the author's argument is that he's tried to talk it through calmly and she's not budging, leading to a stalemate.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author isn't being unreasonable in his stance because he's been upfront. The girlfriend's ultimatum is harsh, but she's also asserting her needs. It's a situation where both have valid points, but their values conflict. In such cases, it's not necessarily about who's \"wrong\" but whether they can find a solution. Since the author is considering his future living arrangements and the girlfriend isn't willing to consider alternatives (like rehoming the cat temporarily or finding another solution), the author's decision to set a boundary isn't necessarily wrong. It's about respecting personal boundaries in a relationship. So, I think the answer is B, No.\n"
