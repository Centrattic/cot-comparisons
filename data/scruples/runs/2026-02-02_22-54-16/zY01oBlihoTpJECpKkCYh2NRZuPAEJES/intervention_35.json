I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend's cat to move in with them. The author is a dog person and doesn't like cats. He's had issues with his girlfriend's average cat, like scratches, bites, and the cat's annoying behavior. He wants to move in together but doesn't want the cat. When he tried to discuss it, his girlfriend reacted coldly and gave an ultimatum: either the cat moves in or they break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasons are personal preferences and discomfort with cats. He's been clear about his feelings. On the other hand, the girlfriend is attached to her cat and sees it as part of her life. The author wants to set boundaries for his living space, which is reasonable. \n\nThe girlfriend's response seems extreme. Giving an ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage might be where the problem lies. The author is trying to communicate his needs, but she's not being flexible. However, the key question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting the cat. Personal preferences about pets are common, and it's reasonable to expect to have control over one's living environment. \n\nBut sometimes, relationships require compromise. The author might need to consider that the cat is part of his girlfriend's life and that finding a solution (like the parents taking the cat) was already suggested but rejected. However, the girlfriend's refusal to compromise by being inflexible might be the issue here. \n\nThe author isn't being unreasonable by setting a boundary. He's not asking to rehome the cat immediately but to not have it in their shared home. The problem is the girlfriend's reaction, not necessarily the author's stance. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
