I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about whether he's at fault for not wanting his girlfriend's cat to move in with them. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is a dog person and doesn't like cats. He has a strong dislike for them, mentioning scratches, bites, and the cat's behavior. His girlfriend has a cat, and they're planning to move in together. He's tried to discuss the issue, but she's being very firm, even giving an ultimatum. Now he's considering his own ultimatum by asking if it's an asshole move to demand she rehome the cat.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me think about the arguments for both sides. On one hand, the author has valid reasons for his dislike of cats. He's had negative experiences and is worried about living with a cat. His dog's compatibility is also a concern. The girlfriend's response seems extreme, turning \"stone fucking cold\" and giving an ultimatum. That's a harsh reaction, maybe overreacting to a discussion that should be compromise-oriented.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have addressed this earlier. He's been dating her for a year, so moving in together is a big step. Perhaps he didn't communicate his feelings about the cat sooner. However, he did try to talk to her and she shut down the conversation. Her ultimatum is all-or-nothing, which isn't healthy. The author's position is about his personal comfort and well-being, which is valid. \n\nIf someone has a strong aversion to a pet, especially if it's causing real issues (like scratches, disruptions), it's reasonable to expect a solution. The girlfriend's refusal to consider alternatives (like the cat staying with her parents) is rigid. The author's counter-ultimatum is a response to her ultimatum, so maybe he's just mirroring her approach here. But is that fair? Well, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If she's being unreasonable, then his stance isn't wrong. \n\nAlso, relationships require compromise. If neither side is willing to budge, that's a problem. But the girlfriend is already holding the relationship hostage, which is a red flag. The author pointing out the same issue by setting a boundary might be necessary for his own happiness. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. His concerns are legitimate, and the girlfriend's response is extreme. He's trying to find a solution that respects both their needs. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
