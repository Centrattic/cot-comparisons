I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in. The author is a dog person and has a lot of negative feelings towards cats. He's had bad experiences with them, like scratches and bites, and finds them unresponsive. His girlfriend is a cat person and the cat is part of her life. She's given an ultimatum: either the cat comes with her or they break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has valid reasons for not wanting a cat\u2014he's allergic to them in a sense, both physically and in terms of his emotional response. He's mentioned trying to find a compromise, like having the cat live with her parents, but she refused. The girlfriend is taking a very firm stance, which might be seen as extreme. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, both partners should be able to express their needs and find a middle ground. However, if one partner is holding the relationship hostage over a pet, that could indicate a problem. The author isn't refusing to move in with her; he's making a request about the cat. The girlfriend's ultimatum seems to be a \"take it or leave it\" approach, which isn't healthy in a relationship. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Arguing that he's not in the wrong because he's standing up for his own boundaries and trying to communicate his needs makes sense. However, some might argue that being unwilling to compromise on a pet could be seen as selfish. But given that the author has tried to find a solution and the girlfriend isn't willing to even consider alternatives, the fault might lie more with her. \n\nAlso, pets are often considered family, so there's an emotional attachment. But the author isn't asking her to get rid of the cat forever, just not to bring it into his home. The girlfriend's refusal to even consider that could be more problematic. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, healthy communication and compromise are essential. If one person is unwilling to budge, it can lead to conflict. The author's stance isn't unreasonable if he's clear about his boundaries. So, I think the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
