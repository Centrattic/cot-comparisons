I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about whether the girlfriend can bring her cat when she moves in with him. The author is a dog person and really doesn't like cats, finding them aloof and difficult. The girlfriend, on the other hand, loves her cat and is firm about not rehoming it, even to her parents. She gives an ultimatum: either the cat comes too, or they break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has valid reasons for not wanting the cat. He's had negative experiences with cats, like scratches and bites, and he's worried about his dog getting along with it. His dislike isn't just preference; it's based on his experiences. On the other hand, the girlfriend's cat is part of her life, and she's not willing to part with it. She might see the cat as a family member, which is understandable.\n\nThe key point here is communication and compromise. The author tried to talk about it, but the girlfriend was unyielding. He's now considering playing hardball by not letting her move in unless the cat is rehomed. The question is whether that's an asshole move or not.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, both partners should be willing to make some concessions. However, if one partner's non-negotiables clash with the other's, it can be a problem. The author's stance is about his comfort and well-being in their shared home. If he can't tolerate the cat, it's a significant issue. But is it his fault that she won't compromise? Maybe not entirely. However, he's also not wrong for setting boundaries about his living space.\n\nThe girlfriend's ultimatum is pretty harsh. By holding the relationship hostage, she's not leaving room for discussion. But the author's response of playing hardball might be seen as equally harsh. However, he's not breaking up first; he's just standing his ground on a condition for moving in together. \n\nLegally and ethically, pets can be a contentious issue. If the author owns the place, he might have the right to set rules about pets. But since it's a relationship, it's more about mutual respect. The author isn't wrong for having his preferences, and the girlfriend isn't wrong for valuing her cat. The problem is the lack of compromise.\n\nIn these situations, it's often about whose needs are more important. If the author can't live with the cat, and she can't part with it, maybe the relationship isn't compatible long-term. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to set a boundary, especially if it's affecting his quality of life. So maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
