I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about him not wanting his girlfriend's cat to move in with them. He's a dog person and really dislikes cats, even going as far as saying he can't stand them. The girlfriend is taking it as an ultimatum\u2014either the cat comes with her, or they break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has valid reasons. He's had negative experiences with cats, finds them uncooperative, and they cause him stress. His dog is his best friend, and he's worried about the cat's impact on their relationship. That's understandable. He's also thinking about the future, wanting to move in together, which is a big step. It's reasonable for him to have preferences about his living environment, especially if the pet is a source of conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend has had the cat for a year, and it's part of her life. She might feel that the cat is part of the package, especially if she's attached to it. However, the way she's responding\u2014turning cold and giving an ultimatum\u2014seems extreme. Relationships should involve compromise, and if one person is holding the relationship hostage over a pet, that could be a red flag. The author is trying to communicate his feelings calmly and rationally, but she's not open to discussion. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author has tried to discuss the issue, suggesting alternatives like the cat staying with her parents. Her response is all-or-nothing, which isn't a healthy approach. The author isn't being unreasonable by not wanting a cat in his home, especially if it causes him stress. He's not asking her to give up the cat entirely, just to find an alternative living arrangement when they move in together. \n\nHowever, there's a question about whether setting a hard boundary here is fair. If the cat is integral to her well-being, maybe there's room for compromise. But given her reaction, it seems she's not willing to negotiate. The author's decision to hold firm isn't necessarily wrong. Relationships require both parties to make concessions, but if one side isn't willing to meet halfway, the other has to decide what they can and can't live with.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. He's expressed his feelings, tried to find a solution, and the problem lies in the girlfriend's unwillingness to compromise. Setting a boundary in this situation is reasonable, especially when it's about their living environment and future plans.\n"
