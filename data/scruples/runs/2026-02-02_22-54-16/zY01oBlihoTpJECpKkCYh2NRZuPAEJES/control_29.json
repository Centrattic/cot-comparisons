I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about whether the author is justified in not wanting their girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in. They don't like cats, have had bad experiences, and their dog is a big part of their life. The girlfriend is adamant, saying they're a package deal and threatening to break up if he doesn't accept the cat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has valid reasons for not liking cats\u2014personal experiences, allergies (maybe?), and concerns about their dog's compatibility. It's reasonable for them to have preferences about their living space, especially if they're planning to move in together. On the other hand, the girlfriend has had the cat for a while and sees it as part of her family. She might feel that giving up the cat is not an option because of the bond she has with it.\n\nThe key point here is mutual respect and compromise in a relationship. The author is trying to communicate their feelings and is looking for a solution. They even suggested alternatives like the cat living with her parents. However, the girlfriend responded with an ultimatum, which is pretty harsh. The author is now considering matching her hardline stance by saying no cat, no move in.\n\nNow, is the author at fault? Well, they're standing up for their own needs. It's not unreasonable to ask for a compromise when moving in together. But maybe they could have approached it differently. For example, exploring more options or giving her more time to adjust. However, the girlfriend's response was extreme, turning cold and presenting a breakup threat. That seems more one-sided. The author isn't wrong for wanting a living environment that suits them, especially if they've been clear about their feelings. The girlfriend's refusal to consider alternatives and her ultimatum might be the bigger issue here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have every right to set boundaries for their home. The problem might lie in the girlfriend's unwillingness to find a middle ground. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
