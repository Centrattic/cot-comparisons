I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Alright, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their girlfriend's cat to move in with them. The situation involves differing preferences about pets, which can be a common relationship issue.\n\nFirst, the author is a dog person and doesn't like cats, finding them unaffectionate and difficult. They've had negative experiences with cats, like scratches and bites. Their girlfriend is a cat person and sees the cat as part of her life. She gave an ultimatum when the author expressed his concerns, leading him to question if he's in the wrong for considering a similar hard stance.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's valid concerns about cohabitation with a pet they dislike could affect their quality of life. However, the girlfriend's attachment to her pet is also significant. In relationships, compromise is key, but when an ultimatum is involved, it complicates things. The girlfriend's response seems extreme, using the relationship as leverage, which isn't healthy. The author's hesitation to move in without resolving the pet issue is understandable, as pets can be a major part of someone's life. However, suggesting to rehome the cat is a tough move. It's important to assess if the author's position is reasonable. Since the cat isn't problematic and the author's dislike is personal, maybe the solution could involve other compromises, like temporary arrangements or shared responsibility. The girlfriend's refusal to consider alternatives might be the bigger issue here. But the author's willingness to set boundaries isn't necessarily wrong, especially if the cat's presence causes him distress. Ultimately, the answer hinges on whether the author is justified in prioritizing his well-being while respecting the girlfriend's attachment. The ultimatum from the girlfriend complicates the situation, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for seeking a resolution that works for both.\n"
