I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a dog person and really doesn't like cats. His girlfriend has a cat, and he doesn't want her to bring it when she moves in with him. He's given his reasons: he doesn't like cats because they're aloof, hard to train, and scratch him. He's tried to talk to her but she's being very firm, even giving an ultimatum that he has to accept the cat or break up. The author is considering responding with his own ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he's been clear about his dislike for cats and his dog's potential issues. He's trying to set boundaries for his living situation. On the other hand, the girlfriend has had the cat for a long time, and she sees them as a package deal. She's not willing to rehome the cat, which is a big deal for her. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting the cat to move in.\n\nI think relationships require compromise. Both parties have to make some concessions. The author is trying to communicate his needs, which seems reasonable. However, his suggestion to play hardball by making her rehome the cat could be seen as taking a firm stance. But is that the wrong thing? If the girlfriend is unwilling to compromise, maybe the author is justified in standing his ground. But if he's approaching it with an ultimatum, that could be seen as harsh.\n\nAnother angle: does the author have a valid reason? He's given specific issues with cats\u2014scratches, noise, etc. Those are legitimate concerns. However, maybe he could have considered solutions like keeping the cat in a separate area, or getting a cat tree to keep it occupied. But the problem is that he's allergic or just doesn't want the cat? The problem here is that the cat is part of his girlfriend's life, and she's not willing to part with it. \n\nThe girlfriend's response of an ultimatum is also problematic. If she's not open to discussion, maybe the author is justified in setting a boundary. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's willing to say that the cat can't come, and she's not willing to accept that, it's a conflict of priorities. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to find middle ground. The author isn't asking to get rid of the cat permanently, just not have it in his home. The girlfriend is unwilling to even consider alternatives. The author's suggestion to play hardball might be a last resort. But is he in the wrong for having a firm boundary? I think not. If he's communicated his feelings calmly and rationally and she's not listening, then he's trying his part. \n\nSo, based on that, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong). He's standing up for his living space and his preferences, which is reasonable. However, if he's approaching it with an ultimatum, that could be seen as harsh. But given the girlfriend's ultimatum first, maybe it's a necessary step. The key is that he's trying to set a boundary to maintain his own comfort and the well-being of his dog. If the relationship can't accommodate mutual respect for each other's boundaries, then it's a problem, but the author isn't necessarily at fault here.\n"
