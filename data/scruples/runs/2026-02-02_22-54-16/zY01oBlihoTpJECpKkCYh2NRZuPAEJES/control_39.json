I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about whether the boyfriend is right to not want his girlfriend's cat to move in with them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a dog person and doesn't like cats at all. He's had negative experiences with cats, like scratches and bites, and finds them uncooperative. He's clear that he doesn't want the cat in his home when they move in together. His girlfriend is a cat person and is unwilling to separate from her cat, even offering an ultimatum if he doesn't accept it.\n\nThe girlfriend's response seems pretty firm. She's not willing to compromise, which might be a problem. The author tried to suggest alternatives, like the cat staying with her parents. She refused and gave an ultimatum. Now he's considering a similar hardball approach by threatening to not let her move in unless the cat is rehomed.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, relationships require mutual respect and compromise. The author expressed his concerns and tried to find a solution. The girlfriend, however, didn't engage in compromise and instead gave an ultimatum. The author is trying to protect his living environment and his comfort, which is valid. However, using a similar ultimatum might not be the best approach, but the question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting the cat.\n\nI think the key here is that the author isn't being unreasonable. He's clear about his preferences and tried to communicate. The girlfriend's refusal to find a middle ground is where the problem lies. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
