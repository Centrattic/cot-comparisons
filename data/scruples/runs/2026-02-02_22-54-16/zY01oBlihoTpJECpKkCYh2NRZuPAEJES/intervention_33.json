I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The author is a dog person and really doesn't like cats. They have a strong dislike for cats, citing past negative experiences\u2014scratches, bites, the cat's aloofness. They mention that even an \"average\" cat is annoying to them. The girlfriend has a cat that's not particularly bad, but the author finds it hard to tolerate. \n\nThe girlfriend is moving in, and the author is considering marriage, so this is a significant decision. They've tried to discuss it, but the girlfriend is firm, saying the cat moves in too. When the author suggests the cat living with her parents, the girlfriend responds coldly and gives an ultimatum: the cat comes with her or they break up.\n\nNow, the author is considering a hardball move\u2014saying she can't move in unless the cat is rehomed. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but wants to know the community's take.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: They have a genuine dislike for cats, which is affecting their relationship. They're setting boundaries about their living space and comfort. It's reasonable for them to not want to live with an animal they find stressful and harmful. Their request is about their own well-being and the compatibility of their future home.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective: She loves her cat and sees it as part of her life. She might feel that the author is being unreasonable or that the cat is not the problem. Her reaction is an ultimatum, which is a strong move, but she might view her cat as a family member that she can't part with.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. The author has tried to discuss it and propose a solution (cat with parents), but the girlfriend dismissed it. The author then is left with the choice to either accept the cat or end the relationship. The question is whether the author is wrong to take the cat's presence as a deal-breaker.\n\nIt's a matter of personal boundaries and values. The author isn't being cruel to the cat, just not wanting to live with it. The girlfriend is being equally firm. Neither side is inherently wrong, but their inability to compromise might be the real issue. The author is standing up for their own comfort, which is valid. If the girlfriend is unwilling to find a middle ground, maybe she's the one being inflexible. However, the author's ultimatum is also a strong move, but given the situation and their strong feelings, it might be justified.\n\nSo, weighing all that, the author is not in the wrong. Their stance is about their own well-being and the future of the relationship. Answer B.\n"
