I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when they don't want their girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in. The author is a dog person and has a lot of negative feelings towards cats. The girlfriend is taking it as an ultimatum, saying they're a package deal and threatening to break up if he doesn't accept the cat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. He's been clear about his dislike for cats, which isn't just a mild preference but a strong aversion. He's mentioned specific issues like scratches, bites, and the cat's behavior being annoying. He's also tried to communicate this calmly and rationally. From his point of view, his dog is important to him, and he's concerned about the cat's presence affecting his dog and his own well-being. \n\nThen there's the girlfriend's side. She's had the cat for a while and views it as part of her life. She's not willing to rehome it, seeing it as a package deal. Her response is pretty firm, suggesting she's not open to compromise. The author feels cornered because he's trying to plan the future and this is a dealbreaker for him. \n\nNow, the key question is whether the author is in the wrong for having this preference. People have different pet preferences, and in a relationship, it's important to find middle ground. But in this case, the author isn't asking for the cat to be rehomed now; he's just saying that when she moves in, the cat shouldn't come. The girlfriend is refusing to budge, which is causing a conflict. \n\nThe author isn't being unreasonable just because he doesn't like cats. His reasons are valid from his perspective. However, relationships require compromise. If both parties are rigid, it could lead to conflict. But the girlfriend's response is more aggressive, using an ultimatum that seems to pressure him into accepting the cat. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He's expressing his needs and trying to find a solution. He's proposed alternatives, like the cat staying with her parents. The girlfriend is the one refusing to consider those options and turning the conversation into a threat. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily wrong in wanting to set boundaries, especially when it's a significant aspect of his living situation. The fault might lie more with the girlfriend's unwillingness to compromise. \n\nBut relationships are two-way streets. If the author is okay with the cat being rehomed by her parents, maybe he should consider that. However, the girlfriend's refusal to even consider alternatives could be seen as inflexible. The author's stance is about his personal comfort and the well-being of his dog, which are legitimate concerns. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for having this preference. The girlfriend's reaction and ultimatum are perhaps more problematic. So the answer would be B.\n"
