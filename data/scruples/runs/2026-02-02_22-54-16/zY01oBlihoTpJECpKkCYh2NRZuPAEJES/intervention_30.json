I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author not wanting his girlfriend's cat to move in with them. He's a dog person and doesn't like cats, has issues with the cat's behavior, and tried discussing it with her but she took it as an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has valid reasons: he's allergic to the cat's behavior, finds cats generally unpleasant, and is concerned about how it might affect their future together. He tried to compromise by suggesting the cat stay with her parents, but she refused and gave an ultimatum. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend has had the cat for a while and considers it part of her life. She might feel that the cat is important to her, and seeing the author's stance as a rejection of her or her pet. The author's position is about his own comfort and future living situation, which is also important.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, personal preferences regarding pets can be a significant issue in relationships. The author isn't being unreasonable by not wanting a cat, especially if it's causing him stress or conflict. However, the way he's approaching it\u2014by considering an ultimatum\u2014could be problematic. Relationships require compromise, and if he's holding out on moving in unless the cat is rehomed, that's a big decision. But since the girlfriend was the one to give an ultimatum first, maybe the author isn't wrong for pushing back. \n\nAlso, the author is expressing his needs and trying to communicate. The girlfriend's reaction might be the bigger issue here. The key is whether the author's request is reasonable. Since he's the one who owns the place where they'll live, he has the right to set boundaries. So, probably, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
