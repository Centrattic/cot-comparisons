I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to bring her cat when they move in together.\n\nFirst, the author clearly states his dislike for cats, citing personal experiences and preferences. He's a dog person, and he's had negative interactions with cats, like scratches and bites. His main issue is that the cat's behavior is annoying and he doesn't want it in their future home. He's even considered asking the cat to live with her parents, but she's unwilling, leading to a potential breakup ultimatum.\n\nNow, the girlfriend's stance is that the cat is part of the package. She's firm, and the author feels like he's being forced to choose between the cat and the relationship. The key here is mutual respect and compromise in a relationship. Both parties need to have their needs considered. \n\nThe author's concern is valid because living with someone's pet is a significant lifestyle choice. However, the girlfriend is equally firm in her position. The author is now considering using a hardball approach, which is essentially matching her ultimatum. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, it's about boundaries and how they're handled. The author is expressing his legitimate discomfort with cats, which is a personal preference. However, the girlfriend's attachment to her cat is also valid. The problem arises in how they're handling the conflict. The author's ultimatum could be seen as equally harsh, but given that she was the first to present a non-negotiable stance, his response might be a necessary step to protect his own well-being. \n\nIn relationships, when one person sets a hard boundary, the other has the right to decide if they can meet that boundary. Since the girlfriend refused to compromise, the author isn't in the wrong for standing his ground. It's a matter of both parties needing to evaluate what they can and cannot accept in a long-term relationship.\n"
