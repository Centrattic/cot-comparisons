I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple considering moving in together, where the author doesn't want the girlfriend's cat to come along. The girlfriend reacts negatively with an ultimatum. The author is asking if it's an asshole move to counter with a hardball approach.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author has strong feelings against cats, has had negative experiences, and doesn't want the cat in their future home. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is attached to her cat and isn't willing to compromise, which leads to a possible breakup. \n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting the cat. The author's reasons are based on personal dislike and practical issues (clawing, noise, etc.), which are valid. The girlfriend's response seems extreme\u2014using the cat as a dealbreaker. \n\nI should consider if the author is being unreasonable. The author has a history with dogs and a clear dislike for cats. Personal preferences matter in relationships, especially when it comes to living arrangements. The girlfriend's ultimatum is a significant reaction, but the author is also standing his ground. \n\nAre there any red flags? The girlfriend's reaction might indicate that she's not willing to negotiate. The author is trying to communicate his needs, which is important for a healthy relationship. However, using a hardball approach could be seen as equally ultimatum-like. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's preferences are legitimate and he's being upfront, then he's not in the wrong. Relationships require compromise, but if one person isn't willing to budge, the other has the right to set boundaries. \n\nSo, the answer would be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. He's expressing his valid concerns about living together, and it's reasonable to expect that pets involved are ones both can live with.\n"
