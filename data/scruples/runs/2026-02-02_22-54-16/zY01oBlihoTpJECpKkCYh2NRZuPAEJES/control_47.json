I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in. \n\nFirst, the author is a dog person and has a strong dislike for cats. He's clear about his preferences and has reasons like the cat's behavior, training issues, and personal discomfort. His girlfriend is a cat person and the cat is part of her life. They're considering living together, which brings up this conflict.\n\nThe author tried to discuss it, but his girlfriend reacted strongly, saying they're a package deal and even giving an ultimatum. He's contemplating a hardball approach to get her to rehome the cat.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong, I need to consider relationship dynamics. Both partners should have their preferences respected. However, when it comes to a major life decision like moving in together, compromises are necessary. The author's stance is about his own comfort and his dog's well-being. His girlfriend's reaction seems rigid, but his potential response of making her rehome the cat could be seen as equally harsh. \n\nIs it fair for him to not want the cat? Yes, it's his choice. But demanding she rehome it is a big ask, especially if she's emotionally attached. The key is balance. He's not wrong for having preferences, but the ultimatum might be crossing a line. However, given her lack of flexibility, his response is a reaction to her stance. \n\nIn relationships, both sides need to meet in the middle. If she's unwilling to compromise, maybe the author is justified in standing his ground. But if he's using a hardball tactic, it could be seen as equally problematic. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, I think the answer leans towards him not being in the wrong because he's expressing his needs and considering the situation where she's not budging. So the answer is B.\n"
