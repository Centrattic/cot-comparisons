I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to bring her cat when they move in together. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a dog person, has a dog, and really doesn't like cats. He mentions specific issues with the cat\u2014like the behavior problems, the noise, and the physical interactions. He's tried talking to his girlfriend, but she's taking it as an ultimatum, saying they're a package deal or else break up. He's considering playing hardball by not letting her move in unless she rehomes the cat.\n\nNow, evaluating if he's in the wrong. The key points here are communication, mutual respect, and compromise. The author expressed his concerns calmly and rationally, but the girlfriend responded with a hard stance. He's trying to find a solution that works for both of them, but she's not open to it. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, it's important for both partners to respect each other's boundaries. The author is setting a boundary about not wanting a cat in their shared home. His girlfriend, however, is not willing to compromise, which is causing tension. \n\nThe question is whether his stance is valid. Since he's had this opinion for a long time and has valid reasons (personal dislike, past experiences), it's reasonable for him to not want a cat. The girlfriend's response seems extreme, using the relationship as a bargaining chip. \n\nHowever, relationships require negotiation. The author might need to consider if there's a middle ground, like the girlfriend keeping the cat in her family's home or finding a cat-friendly environment. But given her ultimatum, the author's reaction is in self-defense to protect his own comfort and space.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing by his needs and trying to find a solution. The girlfriend's approach is more problematic because she's not open to compromise. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
