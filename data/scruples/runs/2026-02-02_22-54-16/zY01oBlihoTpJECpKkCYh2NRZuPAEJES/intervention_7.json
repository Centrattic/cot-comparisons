I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who doesn't want his girlfriend's cat to move in with them. He's a dog person and has a lot of issues with cats, like scratches, the cat's behavior, and the fact that the cat doesn't seem to care about him. The girlfriend is taking it as an ultimatum, saying it's either the cat moves in or they break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that he genuinely dislikes cats, even going so far as to say he can't stand them. He's tried to discuss it calmly but the girlfriend is resistant. She's saying they're a package deal, which is a tough stance. The author is conflicted because he wants to move in together but can't stand the cat. He's wondering if it's an asshole move to rehome the cat if she's being so firm.\n\nOn one hand, personal preferences about pets are valid. People have different animal preferences, and it's reasonable to want a living environment that suits them. The author's dog's compatibility with the cat is a practical concern too. If the dog might not get along, that's an issue. Also, the author's safety and comfort when the cat scratches or bites is a real concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend has had the cat for a while and is clearly attached. The cat isn't particularly problematic according to her. The author's strong dislike might be overblown, but it's not like he's being asked to harm the cat. However, the girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, using an ultimatum. If she's unwilling to compromise, maybe she's not being fair. But the author is also being firm, which could be seen as not respecting her attachment to the cat.\n\nI need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: his valid dislike of cats, the practical issues (dog compatibility, scratches), and the girlfriend's ultimatum. The author is trying to communicate his needs, which are important for his well-being in their shared home. If the girlfriend is unwilling to find a middle ground, the author might be justified in holding his stance. However, rehoming the cat without her consent could be a problem. But in the question, he's not actually doing it yet, just considering if it's an asshole move to do so. The original question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting the cat. Since his reasons are personal and valid, and the girlfriend isn't compromising, the author might not be in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
