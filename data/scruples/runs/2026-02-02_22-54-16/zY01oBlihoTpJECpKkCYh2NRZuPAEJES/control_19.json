I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to bring her cat when they move in together. \n\nFirst, the author is a dog person and has strong negative feelings towards cats. He mentions past issues with cats being scratchy and unresponsive. His girlfriend has a cat, and he doesn't want it to move in with them. The girlfriend is being very firm, even giving an ultimatum.\n\nThe question is about whether he's in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. \n\nThe author's perspective: He's expressing a genuine dislike for cats, which could affect their living environment. His dog might not get along with the cat. He's trying to communicate this rationally, but the girlfriend is unyielding. He's concerned about their future together and wants to make sure living arrangements work for him. \n\nThe girlfriend's perspective: She loves her cat and sees it as part of her life. She's making it clear that she won't separate from her pet, which is understandable. People often form strong bonds with their pets. Her reaction might be because she feels her partner isn't respecting her attachment to the cat.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. When two people live together, compromises are necessary. The author is trying to set boundaries about his living space. However, his girlfriend is equally firm. The author is asking if his stance is wrong, but it's a matter of differing priorities. \n\nIs it fair for the author to expect her to rehome the cat? Maybe. But is he in the wrong? Well, he's standing up for his preferences. But relationships require mutual respect. If she's unwilling to compromise, perhaps the issue is about how to handle the conflict rather than who is morally wrong. \n\nThe key points: The author's dislike is personal and valid, but the girlfriend's attachment is also valid. The ultimatum from her side is a relationship issue. The author's suggestion to play hardball could be seen as equally ultimatum-based. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe neither is entirely at fault. The problem is communication and compromise. The author isn't in the wrong for having his preferences, but the way he handles it matters. However, the girlfriend's hardline stance is also a factor. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's trying to explain his feelings and the girlfriend is not budging, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong. But if he's using a hardball approach, that could be seen as a problem. However, the original question is about whether he's in the wrong for not wanting the cat. \n\nGiven that, his stance is personal preference. So the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong). The girlfriend's response is more about how she's handling it, but his position isn't inherently wrong.\n"
