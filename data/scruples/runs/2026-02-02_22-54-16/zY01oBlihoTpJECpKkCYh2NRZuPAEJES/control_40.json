I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy doesn't like cats and doesn't want his girlfriend's cat to move in with them when they get a place together. The girlfriend is taking it as an ultimatum and is threatening to break up if the cat isn't included. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is clear about his dislike for cats, citing past negative experiences and how he's a dog person. He's tried to discuss it but the girlfriend is firm. She loves the cat and sees it as part of her life. The author is considering rehoming the cat as a countermeasure.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. The key points here are about mutual respect and willingness to compromise. The author is being honest about his feelings towards cats, which is fair. But does the girlfriend have a right to include her cat as a non-negotiable part of the relationship?\n\nOn one hand, the author has a valid preference. People have different allergies or preferences regarding pets, and it's reasonable for him to not want a cat. On the other hand, the girlfriend is attached to her cat, which is part of her life. However, in a serious relationship where one is planning to live together, both parties should be willing to make some compromises. The girlfriend is using the cat as a deal-breaker, which might indicate that the cat's presence is more important to her than the relationship. \n\nBut the author is also considering the future of their living situation and the potential conflict between his dog and the cat. The girlfriend's refusal to even consider alternatives (like the parents) is a problem. The author's threat to rehome the cat if she doesn't agree is a hard stance, but if she's not willing to budge, maybe it's a necessary step. \n\nHowever, threatening to rehome a pet without the owner's consent is a big deal. It could be seen as controlling or disrespectful. The author needs to consider the ethical implications of taking over her pet's care. But if the girlfriend is holding the relationship hostage, the author might feel he's justified in his countermove.\n\nBalancing these factors, the author's stance isn't entirely wrong because he's standing up for his own well-being and the practicalities of living together. However, using a hardball tactic like rehoming might be crossing a line. The real issue is whether both can find a middle ground. Since the girlfriend is unwilling to compromise, the author's position could be seen as valid, but his method of enforcing it might be questionable. But in the context of the girlfriend's ultimatum, maybe the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
