I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the situation is that the author doesn't want their girlfriend to bring her cat when they move in together. He's a dog person, has issues with cats, and the cat's behavior is a problem for him. The girlfriend is being very firm, even giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is justified in his position. He has valid reasons: the cat's behavior is annoying and stressful for him, and he's concerned about compatibility with his own dog. It's his home, so he should have some say in the living conditions. But then again, the girlfriend has had the cat for a while and sees it as part of her life. The question is whether his stance is reasonable or if he's being unreasonable.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is key here. She's not open to compromise and is threatening to break up if he doesn't accept the cat. That's a big move. But the author is also considering an ultimatum in response. Now, is it fair for him to do that? Well, if he's not comfortable with the cat in his home, he's not in the wrong for setting boundaries. However, the way he's considering responding (playing hardball) might be seen as equally harsh. But he's just matching her approach, which is already aggressive. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong because he's standing up for his own needs and the living situation. The girlfriend is the one who's not willing to find a middle ground, maybe. The main issue is whether he's overstepping by not allowing the cat. But since it's his home, he has the right to set those terms. The problem is if the cat's presence is a significant negative impact on his life, then it's reasonable for him to ask for it not to be there. The girlfriend's ultimatum is more extreme, but the author's response is a reaction to that. So I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
