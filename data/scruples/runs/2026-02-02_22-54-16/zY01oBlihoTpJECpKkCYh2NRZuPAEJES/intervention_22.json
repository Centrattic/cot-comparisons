I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author doesn't want their girlfriend's cat to move in with them. The girlfriend is giving an ultimatum, saying it's either the cat or the relationship. The author is considering responding with a similar hardball approach.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid dislike for cats, which seems to be causing them stress and conflict. They mention specific issues like scratches, the cat's behavior, and difficulty in training. These are real concerns when it comes to living together with a pet you don't get along with. On the other hand, the girlfriend is attached to her cat and sees it as part of her life, which is understandable. The cat isn't particularly problematic, just average for a cat, which the author finds unbearable.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting the cat. The author's stance is that their dislike is strong enough to affect their future living situation. The girlfriend's response, however, seems extreme by giving an ultimatum without negotiation. The author is considering matching that approach, which could be seen as equally harsh.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's tricky. The author has the right to set boundaries for their living environment. However, the way they respond\u2014threatening to break up if the cat isn't rehomed\u2014mirrors the girlfriend's ultimatum. That could be seen as tit-for-tat, but if the author stands their ground calmly, maybe it's justified. The key here is whether the author's position is reasonable. Since the author has a legitimate issue with the cat's presence affecting their well-being, and the girlfriend isn't compromising, the author might not be in the wrong for not backing down. However, using a hardball tactic might not be the most mature approach. But given the ultimatum from the girlfriend, maybe it's a necessary step to protect their own interests. So overall, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting the cat, especially if they approach it with respect rather than just an ultimatum. The main issue is the girlfriend's inflexibility, not the author's stance.\n"
