I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong regarding their situation with their girlfriend and her cat. The main points are the author's dislike for cats, the girlfriend's refusal to separate from her cat, and the ultimatum she gave.\n\nFirst, the author has a strong aversion to cats, which is understandable. They've had negative experiences and don't see the appeal. It's important to note that preferences differ, and being a \"dog person\" doesn't make them wrong. The girlfriend is a significant part of their life, and they see a future together, but the cat is a problem.\n\nThe girlfriend's response was firm. When the author suggested the cat could stay with her parents, she said they're a package deal. Then, when the author tried to talk, she gave an ultimatum. That's pretty harsh. The author is now considering a hardball approach by making the cat's rehoming a condition for the girlfriend moving in.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author is expressing a valid personal preference. They're not being unreasonable about the cat's existence but about it living with them. The girlfriend, however, is making it an all-or-nothing situation without compromise. The ultimatum she gave is a red flag because it pressures the author to choose between the cat and the relationship. \n\nThe key here is mutual respect and compromise in a relationship. The author is trying to communicate their feelings, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's response is rigid, not allowing for discussion. The author's potential counter-ultimatum is a response to her ultimatum, which might be seen as equally harsh, but given her initial stance, maybe the author isn't wrong in standing their ground. It's a tough spot, but the girlfriend's approach seems more problematic. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
