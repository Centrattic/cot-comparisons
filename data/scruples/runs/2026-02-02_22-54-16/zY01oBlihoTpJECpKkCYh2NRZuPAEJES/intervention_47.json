I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their girlfriend's cat to move in with them. The author explains that they're a dog person, don't like cats, and have issues with the cat's behavior. They tried to talk to their girlfriend about it, but she was firm, saying it's a package deal. Now they're considering playing hardball.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has valid reasons: they don't like cats, the cat's behavior is problematic, and they're thinking long-term. On the other hand, the girlfriend loves her cat and sees it as part of her life. She's given an ultimatum, which is pretty harsh.\n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting the cat? Well, personal preferences matter. If the cat is causing real issues (scratches, noise, etc.), it's reasonable for the author to have concerns. They tried to compromise by suggesting the cat stay with her parents. The girlfriend's response was an ultimatum, which is extreme. \n\nBut relationships require compromise. The author is at a crossroads. If the girlfriend is unwilling to consider alternatives, maybe the author is justified in setting a boundary. However, the author's response of playing hardball could be seen as equally extreme. However, given the girlfriend's firm stance, the author might feel they have no choice.\n\nSo, the key points: the author's reasons are legitimate, tried to find a solution, and the girlfriend's ultimatum is a problem. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for standing their ground, especially if they've made their feelings clear. The girlfriend's reaction is probably more at fault here. Therefore, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
