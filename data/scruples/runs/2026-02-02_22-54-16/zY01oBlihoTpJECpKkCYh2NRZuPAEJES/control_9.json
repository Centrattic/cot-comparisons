I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is a dog person and doesn't like cats at all. They have a dog they love, and they're in a relationship with their girlfriend for almost a year. The girlfriend has a cat, which the author finds really annoying. The cat's behavior\u2014jumping around, stepping on them, using claws, yowling at night\u2014is bothering the author. They want their girlfriend to move in with them but don't want the cat to come along. They tried suggesting that the cat could stay with her parents, but she refused, saying they're a package deal. Then she gave an ultimatum: either they both move in or they break up. The author is considering if it's an asshole move to counter with a hardball approach and say she can't move in unless she rehomes the cat.\n\nFirst, I should think about the core issue here. It's about differing pet preferences and how to resolve a conflict in a relationship. The author's problem is personal\u2014he doesn't like cats and the cat's presence is causing him significant discomfort. The girlfriend, on the other hand, loves the cat and is unwilling to separate from it, even suggesting that the author has to accept the cat for the relationship to continue.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, it's a matter of personal preference and boundary setting. The author isn't saying they can't have pets at all, just that they don't want a cat. That's a valid personal choice. However, the girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. Giving an ultimatum and threatening a breakup over the cat is a big deal. The author is considering rehoming the cat as a countermeasure, but is that justifiable?\n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to their own living environment and comfort. If the cat's presence is making their life difficult and they can't see a way forward where they can coexist without stress, then their stance isn't unreasonable. They might be trying to be fair by suggesting the cat go to her parents, but she's not open to that solution. So, the author might feel that the only way to resolve it is to set a boundary that the cat can't be in their home.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's cat is part of her life and she's attached to it. Rehoming the cat could mean finding a new home, which is a significant responsibility and might not be easy. The author is essentially suggesting that she has to give up her cat to be with him, which could be seen as forcing her to make a choice between the relationship and her pet. That might be a tough position for her, especially if she's allergic to the idea of parting with the cat. Her ultimatum is also a problem because it's not healthy to hold a relationship hostage like that. However, the author's hardball approach might not be any better. It's a matter of who is more wrong here.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors are the severity of the conflict, the communication between both parties, and the fairness of the ultimatum. The author's dislike of cats is a personal preference, and if it's causing real issues (like the cat scratching or causing disturbances), then it's a legitimate concern. The girlfriend is unwilling to compromise, and the author is considering a counter-ultimatum. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is usually important. The girlfriend's refusal to consider alternatives might be where she's at fault. The author is trying to find a solution but is met with an ultimatum. By responding with a counter-ultimatum, the author is trying to enforce their own boundaries. Whether this is acceptable depends on the context. If the cat's presence is genuinely affecting the author's well-being and the relationship's future, then standing firm might be justified. But if the author is being inflexible and not considering the girlfriend's feelings, that could be a problem.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is pretty harsh. Telling the author to figure out what's more important or they'll break up is a high-pressure tactic. The author's suggestion to send the cat to her parents is a practical solution, and if that's not acceptable, then the author might feel that the only way is to set a boundary. However, rehoming the cat is a more drastic step than the girlfriend's idea of not separating from the pet. \n\nI think in this scenario, the girlfriend is being unreasonable by not being open to any compromise. The author is within their rights to want their living space to be comfortable and to not have to deal with a pet they dislike. The girlfriend's ultimatum is the bigger issue here because it's not a healthy way to approach a disagreement. The author's hardball response, while not the most diplomatic, is a way to enforce their own boundaries after the girlfriend has already set a strict condition. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they have valid reasons for not wanting the cat and have tried to communicate their concerns. The girlfriend, however, is being inflexible. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
