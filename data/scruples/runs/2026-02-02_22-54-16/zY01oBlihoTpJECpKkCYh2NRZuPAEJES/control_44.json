I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario is that the author doesn't want their girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in. The author is a dog person and has strong negative feelings towards cats, mentioning past issues with scratches and bites. The girlfriend is a cat person and is unwilling to separate from her cat, leading to a potential conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author's reasons are based on personal dislike of cats, which they explain in detail. They've tried to discuss it, but the girlfriend is firm, even giving an ultimatum. The key points here are about personal preferences and the impact on the relationship. \n\nIs it fair for the author to have this stance? Personal preferences about pets are common in relationships. The author's dislike isn't trivial; they mention physical annoyances and stress from the cat's behavior. However, the girlfriend's emotional attachment to the cat is significant. \n\nThe girlfriend's response is a hard ultimatum, which is a problem because it frames it as the author's choice to either accept the cat or break up. That's a high-pressure tactic. But the author is also considering setting boundaries by saying the cat can't come. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether personal preferences about pets can coexist in a relationship. The author isn't being unreasonable about their dislike, but the girlfriend isn't flexible. The author's request to not have the cat is a valid personal choice. However, the author's proposed solution (playing hardball) mirrors the girlfriend's ultimatum. \n\nUltimately, both parties have valid points. The author isn't wrong for not wanting the cat, but the way they handle it (playing hardball) could be seen as equally ultimatuming. However, the girlfriend was the first to issue the ultimatum. The author's question is whether their stance is asshole territory. The answer is likely B (No), because it's a personal preference, and the girlfriend's inflexibility is problematic. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, even if the method could be improved. So the answer is B.\n"
