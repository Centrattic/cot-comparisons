I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting their girlfriend's cat to move in with them. The situation involves a conflict between the author's dislike of cats and the girlfriend's strong attachment to her cat. \n\nFirst, it's important to consider the author's reasons. They clearly state that they are a dog person and have had issues with cats in the past\u2014scratches, bites, the cat's behavior being annoying. They've had this discussion with their girlfriend, but she's unwilling to compromise, even going as far as giving an ultimatum. The author is considering a hardball approach by asking her to rehome the cat if they move in together.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, people should be able to have pets and bring them into shared living situations if both parties agree. However, in this case, the author has clear, long-standing issues with cats that they believe would affect their quality of life and the relationship. The girlfriend's refusal to consider alternatives (like having the cat stay with her parents) might indicate that she's not open to negotiation, which could be a red flag about how she handles conflict.\n\nThe author's stance is about personal comfort and well-being. If the cat's presence causes significant stress or conflict, it's reasonable for the author to want a resolution. The girlfriend's ultimatum is aggressive, which might make the author's potential counter-ultimatum seem like a justified response. However, using a breakup threat over a pet might be seen as extreme, but the author is also trying to set boundaries for their own happiness.\n\nIt's also worth noting that pets are a big responsibility and part of someone's life. The girlfriend may view the cat as a family member, making the issue more emotional for her. The author's position is about respecting their own preferences and living environment. Since the girlfriend isn't willing to compromise, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for standing their ground, especially if they've expressed their concerns calmly and rationally.\n\nIn relationships, compromises are necessary. But when one party is unwilling to find a middle ground, the other is within their rights to prioritize their own needs and limits. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address this issue, even if it leads to a difficult conversation or decision.\n"
