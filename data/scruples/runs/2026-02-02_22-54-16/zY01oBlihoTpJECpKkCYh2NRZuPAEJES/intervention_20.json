I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author here is in the wrong. So the situation is that he's a dog person and doesn't like cats. His girlfriend has a cat, and when she moves in, he doesn't want the cat to come. He's tried to talk to her about it, but she's being very firm and even offered an ultimatum. Now he's asking if it's an asshole move to play hardball back and tell her the cat can't move in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he genuinely doesn't like cats and has valid reasons\u2014scratches, bites, the cat's behavior, etc. He wants to live comfortably with his dog and doesn't think he can coexist with a cat. On the other hand, his girlfriend sees the cat as part of her life and isn't willing to compromise, even to the point of threatening to break up if he doesn't accept the cat.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting the cat. Well, personal preferences in pets can be a significant issue in relationships. It's reasonable for someone to have strong feelings about pets, especially if they've had negative experiences. However, the author's approach here is to set a boundary by refusing to have the cat in their future home. Is that fair?\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also a factor. She's not being flexible and is holding the relationship hostage, which is a red flag. If she's unwilling to consider alternatives, like rehoming the cat, even temporarily, that shows a lack of compromise. The author is trying to communicate his needs but is met with an ultimatum. In that case, standing his ground might be justified because relationships require mutual respect and compromise from both sides.\n\nBut is the author's stance an asshole move? The key is whether his position is unreasonable. Since he's clear about his feelings and is trying to have a future together, it's about balancing his needs with hers. If she's unwilling to find a solution, the author isn't in the wrong for stating his non-negotiable. However, the way he handles the conflict could matter. For example, if he's respectful and offers solutions, like the cat staying with her parents, but she refuses, then he's not at fault.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. He's expressing his needs, and if the girlfriend isn't willing to meet him halfway, it's her issue. The problem isn't his aversion to cats but her unwillingness to negotiate. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
