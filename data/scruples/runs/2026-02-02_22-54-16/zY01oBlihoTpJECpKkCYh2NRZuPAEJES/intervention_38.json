I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in. The scenario is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is a dog person, has a dog, and really doesn't like cats. He's been with his girlfriend for almost a year and is considering marriage. The girlfriend is firm that the cat must come too. When he suggests alternatives like the cat staying with her parents, she refuses, making it an ultimatum. He feels cornered and is wondering if it's an AITA situation.\n\nThe author's reasoning: He's clear about his dislike for cats, explaining specific issues like the cat's behavior and his discomfort. He's tried to discuss it but the girlfriend isn't budging. He's not being unreasonable about the cat itself, just his personal preference. The girlfriend is using the relationship as a bargaining chip, which is a red flag.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. In a healthy relationship, both partners should work through issues. However, the girlfriend's response\u2014making it an ultimatum\u2014is extreme. The author is trying to communicate his needs calmly. The problem is that the cat is a significant part of her life, but the author's stance is about his living environment and his dog's well-being.\n\nThe question is whether he's wrong for setting a boundary. Since he's given reasons and tried to negotiate, and she's holding the relationship hostage, he might be justified in pushing back. But some might argue that pets are part of a partner's life and should be accommodated. However, if the partner is unwilling to even consider alternatives (like the parents' suggestion), the author's stance is more about his own well-being.\n\nSo, in the AITA framework, if someone is being unreasonable, they're more in the wrong. The girlfriend is being rigid and using an ultimatum, which is a problem. The author is trying to find a solution but is met with resistance. Therefore, the answer would lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
