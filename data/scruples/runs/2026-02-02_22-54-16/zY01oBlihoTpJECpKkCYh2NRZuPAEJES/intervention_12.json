I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting their girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is clear about their dislike for cats, which is a valid personal preference. They mention specific issues like the cat's behavior (scratching, biting, noise) and their own experiences with cats being unresponsive. They also tried to discuss the matter with their girlfriend but faced a strong reaction.\n\nThe girlfriend's response was an ultimatum, which is a red flag. Holding a relationship hostage over a pet is not healthy. The author is trying to communicate their needs, which is reasonable. Setting boundaries in a relationship is important for mutual respect. If one person's preferences are non-negotiable and they're willing to end the relationship over it, that's a problem. The author is not being unreasonable by not wanting a cat in their home, especially since they've had negative experiences.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could have approached the conversation differently, but given the girlfriend's reaction, it's clear she's not open to discussion. The author is standing by their own needs, which is okay. They\u2019re not forcing the girlfriend to get rid of the cat immediately but are stating their position for when she moves in. The girlfriend's unwillingness to compromise is the bigger issue here.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they're asserting their boundaries. The girlfriend's ultimatum is more problematic. So the answer should be B.\n"
