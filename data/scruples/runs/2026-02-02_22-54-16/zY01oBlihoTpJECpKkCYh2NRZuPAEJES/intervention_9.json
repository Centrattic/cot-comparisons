I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend's cat to move in with them. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is a dog person and really doesn't like cats. He has specific reasons: cats don't show affection the way he wants, they're hard to train, and they've caused him scratches and bites. He's clear that he can't stand cats and that even an average one is a problem for him. He's considering moving in with his girlfriend and doesn't want the cat there. His main issue is compatibility with the cat, not the girlfriend.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is a cat owner and seems very attached to her cat. When the author suggests the cat could live with her parents, she responds strongly, saying they're a package deal. She gave an ultimatum, which is pretty harsh. The author feels cornered and is considering a hardball approach himself.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Personal preferences about pets can be tricky. The author has a valid reason\u2014he genuinely can't stand cats and they cause him physical discomfort. His stance isn't about being mean to the cat but about his own well-being and living situation. It's his home, so he has the right to set boundaries. However, moving in together is a big step, and this is a significant issue for both their future.\n\nBut the girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. By holding the relationship hostage, she's making it an all-or-nothing situation. The author is trying to communicate his needs calmly and rationally. If she's unwilling to compromise, maybe the problem lies more with her response than his stance. He's trying to find a solution (like the cat living with her parents) but she refused. In relationships, both parties need to be flexible. If she's not willing to find a middle ground, it's her rigidity that's the issue. \n\nThe question is whether the author's refusal to accept the cat is inconsiderate. Since he's clear about his deep dislike and the practical issues (dog compatibility, personal comfort), it's not just an arbitrary preference. So he's not in the wrong for having a boundary. The problem might be his potential response (playing hardball) but the original question is about whether he's in the wrong for not wanting the cat. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
