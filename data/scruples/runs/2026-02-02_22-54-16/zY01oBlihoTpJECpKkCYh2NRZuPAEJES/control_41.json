I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author doesn't want their girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in. He's a dog person, really loves his dog, and doesn't like cats at all. He's had bad experiences with them\u2014scratches, bites, and they don't show affection the way he wants. His girlfriend is a great person, but her cat is causing issues when they spend time together. The author is considering moving in with her, but the cat is a problem. He's tried to talk to her, but she's firm, saying they're a package deal, and if he can't handle it, maybe they should break up.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is being reasonable. He has valid reasons for not wanting the cat\u2014personal preference, past experiences, and potential issues with his dog. On the other hand, the girlfriend has a right to keep her pet, which is part of her life. Moving in together usually means compromising on various aspects. The author is trying to set boundaries about his living space, which is understandable. However, the girlfriend's response is an ultimatum, which is pretty harsh. She's essentially saying that if he won't allow the cat, then they should break up. That's a high-pressure tactic. The author is now considering an ultimatum in return, which could be seen as equally harsh. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for not wanting the cat? Probably not. It's his home, and he's allowed to have preferences. The problem is more on the girlfriend's side for not being open to compromise. But maybe there's more context? The author tried to suggest alternatives, like the cat staying with her parents. She refused. If she's not willing to budge, then maybe the author is justified in standing his ground. However, the way he's thinking about responding (playing hardball) could be seen as equally problematic. If he says she can't move in unless the cat is rehomed, that's also an ultimatum. So, both sides are using ultimatums, which isn't a healthy way to resolve conflicts. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. The key is whether his stance is unreasonable. Not wanting a cat in his home isn't wrong. The girlfriend's refusal to consider alternatives is her issue. The author isn't being a jerk for not wanting a cat. The problem is the girlfriend's response, not the author's initial position. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
