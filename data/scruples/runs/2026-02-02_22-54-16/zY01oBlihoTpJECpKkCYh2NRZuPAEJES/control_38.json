I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong regarding his decision not to have his girlfriend's cat when she moves in. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a dog person and has had dogs all his life. He really likes their social nature and how they interact with humans. On the other hand, he's a self-proclaimed cat hater. He lists several reasons: cats don't show affection, they're hard to train, they scratch and bite him without reason, and even an average cat is a nightmare for him. He's had bad experiences with cats, like the cat jumping, stepping on him, using claws, and making noise.\n\nHis girlfriend has a cat, and they're planning to move in together. He doesn't want the cat to come, fearing issues with his dog and his own discomfort. When he tried to discuss this, his girlfriend became cold and gave an ultimatum: either the cat moves in with him or they break up. The author is now considering whether to hold his ground and require the cat to be rehomed.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nThe author's perspective: He's being honest about his dislike for cats, which is a valid personal preference. He's not being cruel to the cat, just not wanting it in his home. He's tried to negotiate (suggesting the cat go to her parents), but she refused. He's concerned about his dog's interaction and his own well-being. If he's not the one who brought the cat into the relationship, it's understandable he'd want to make his home comfortable for himself.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective: She loves the cat and sees it as part of her life. Her response was an ultimatum, which is extreme. However, pets are often considered family by many, so her attachment is understandable. Her reaction suggests she views the cat as non-negotiable, which might be unreasonable if it's causing significant issues for the author.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. The author tried to negotiate, but she didn't budge. Her ultimatum is problematic because it's holding the relationship hostage over a pet. The author's stance is about his living situation and mental health. While pets are important, the partner's well-being should also be considered. Rehoming the cat is a significant decision, but the girlfriend's refusal to consider alternatives makes the author's hardline stance understandable. He's not being cruel; he's asserting his boundaries.\n\nHowever, the author should consider whether his stance is absolute. Maybe there's a middle ground, like trial period or professional help for the cat's behavior. But given her ultimatum, he might feel he has no choice. The key factors are her unwillingness to compromise and the author's valid concerns. In this case, the author isn't in the wrong because he's standing up for his needs after failed negotiations.\n"
