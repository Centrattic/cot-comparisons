I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author not wanting their girlfriend's cat to move in with them, leading to a potential conflict.\n\nFirst, the author has strong feelings about not liking cats. They mention being scratched and bitten, and finding cats unaffectionate compared to dogs. This is their personal preference, which is valid. Now, the girlfriend is taking it as an ultimatum, which adds tension. \n\nThe key points here: The author is trying to communicate their discomfort with the cat in a future living situation. They suggested compromise, like the cat staying with her parents. However, the girlfriend responded with a hard ultimatum. The author is now considering playing hardball in return.\n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting the cat? Probably not. Everyone has different preferences about pets in their home. But the way the girlfriend reacted is extreme. However, the author's response\u2014threatening to rehome the cat if she doesn't\u2014could be seen as equally ultimatum-like, which might escalate the conflict. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since the author is standing by their preference and tried to find a solution, they aren't necessarily at fault. The girlfriend's rigid stance is problematic. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
