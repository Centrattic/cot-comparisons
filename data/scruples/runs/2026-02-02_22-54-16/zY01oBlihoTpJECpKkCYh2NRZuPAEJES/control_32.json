I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe user is a guy who's dating a girl and they're about to move in together. He has a dog, and he really doesn't like cats. His girlfriend has a cat, and he doesn't want the cat to move in with them. He's tried to talk to her about it, but she's firm, saying they're a package deal. When he proposed a solution of the cat living with her parents, she refused and gave him an ultimatum: either the cat comes too, or they break up. Now he's considering if it's an asshole move to counter with his own ultimatum about the cat needing to be rehomed if she moves in.\n\nFirst, I should consider both perspectives. The guy has valid reasons for not wanting the cat. He's had bad experiences with cats before, finds them difficult, and his dog might not get along with the cat. He's clear that he's a dog person and the cat is a problem for him. The girlfriend, on the other hand, loves her cat and isn't willing to rehome it. She's made it clear that she won't give up the cat, even if it means breaking up. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's think about the key points here. The guy is being upfront about his feelings towards cats. He's tried to compromise by suggesting the cat stay with her parents, but she won't accept that. She's using the relationship as leverage, which can be a red flag. The author is now considering his own ultimatum.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to make compromises. If one person is completely unwilling to budge on an issue that's a deal-breaker for the other, it's a problem. The girlfriend's response was an ultimatum, which is a serious stance. The author is now considering a counter-ultimatum. Is that fair? Well, if the cat's presence is making the author's life significantly worse (like the scratching, bites, noise, etc.), and he's clear about it, then he's justified in wanting to maintain his quality of life.\n\nBut is it in his wrong to set a boundary? If he's willing to move in together only if the cat isn't there, that's his right. However, using the relationship as a bargaining chip is a hard decision. However, if the girlfriend was unwilling to even consider alternatives, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The key is whether he's being reasonable. He's not asking her to give up the cat permanently, just to find an alternative living arrangement. Her refusal to consider that solution might be where she's in the wrong, not the author.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing up for his needs and has tried to find a solution. The girlfriend's inflexibility is the issue here. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
