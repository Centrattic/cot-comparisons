I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend's cat to move in with them. \n\nFirst, the author clearly states his dislike for cats, giving reasons like their aloofness, the trouble they cause (scratches, bites), and how they don't respond well to training. He also mentions specific issues with the cat's behavior when he's at her apartment. That seems valid because personal preferences about pets can be strong.\n\nHe's been in a relationship for almost a year and is considering marriage. That's a significant commitment, so his concerns about living together and the cat's presence are part of planning their future. He tried to discuss it calmly and suggested alternatives like the cat living with her parents, but she refused and gave an ultimatum. \n\nNow, the girlfriend's reaction is pretty harsh. Turning \"stone fucking cold\" and giving an ultimatum where she holds the relationship hostage if he doesn't accept the cat. That seems extreme. The author is now considering playing hardball by not letting the girlfriend move in unless the cat is rehomed. \n\nIs the author wrong for that? Well, he's trying to resolve a conflict that's important to his quality of life. The girlfriend's refusal to compromise, especially with an ultimatum, might make the author feel that he has no choice but to set a boundary. However, the author is also using a hardball tactic, which could be seen as equally ultimatum-like. \n\nBut the key here is whether the author's stance is unreasonable. His dislike for cats is a personal preference, but so is her love for the cat. When moving in together, both partners need to compromise. The girlfriend's refusal to even consider alternatives (like the cat staying with her parents) might be the bigger issue here. The author's suggestion to rehome the cat is a possible solution, but is that fair?\n\nIn relationships, both parties should work towards solutions that respect each other's needs. If the girlfriend is unwilling to find a middle ground, she might be the one at fault. The author is standing up for his living environment and his dog's well-being. However, threatening to break up over the cat might be extreme, but he's responding to her ultimatum.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's dealing with a personal issue that affects his home life, and he's trying to find a solution. The girlfriend's inflexibility is a bigger problem. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
