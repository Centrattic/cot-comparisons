I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a dog person who really dislikes cats. They've been in a relationship for almost a year and are considering marriage. The girlfriend has a cat, and the author doesn't want the cat to move in with them. The girlfriend is refusing to consider alternatives, leading to a potential ultimatum.\n\nFirst, the author's reasons for not wanting the cat are personal but valid. They have legitimate issues with cats\u2014scratches, bites, noise, etc. They've tried to discuss it calmly and even suggested solutions like the cat staying with her parents. The girlfriend's response is rigid and emotional, turning cold and offering a breakup if the cat isn't part of the deal.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong for setting a boundary. The author is asking if it's an asshole move to hold the line on this issue. They're not being unreasonable; they've already tried to compromise. The girlfriend's ultimatum seems overly harsh, especially since the author isn't asking for the cat to be given up permanently, just not to move into their shared home. \n\nThe girlfriend's response of making it an all-or-nothing situation might indicate that the cat is more important to her than the relationship, which could be a red flag. The author is standing by their needs and making it clear that this is a deal-breaker, which is a reasonable stance in a potential lifelong partnership. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
