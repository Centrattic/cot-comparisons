I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in. The author is a self-proclaimed dog person and has significant issues with cats, including the cat's behavior and the stress it causes. He's tried to discuss it with his girlfriend, but she's taking it as an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's concerns are valid from his perspective\u2014he's allergic to the stress and the cat's behavior. It's reasonable for him to not want a pet that he finds difficult to get along with. However, the girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. She's holding the relationship hostage, which isn't healthy. The question is whether the author is wrong for setting boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. But if one person is unwilling to meet halfway, it's a problem. The author is trying to communicate his needs, and she's not being open to solutions. The fact that she's using the cat as a deal-breaker without considering alternatives (like finding a new home for the cat or the author working on his discomfort) might mean she's not being fair. The author isn't asking her to get rid of the cat entirely; just not to bring it into his home. The girlfriend's parents could take the cat, as suggested. Her refusal to consider that solution is part of the issue.\n\nSo, while both sides have valid points, the girlfriend's ultimatum and lack of compromise might place the responsibility on her. The author is trying to set a boundary that's important to him for their shared future. If she's not willing to negotiate, it's her part that's problematic. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; he's standing up for his needs in a relationship where compromise isn't happening.\n"
