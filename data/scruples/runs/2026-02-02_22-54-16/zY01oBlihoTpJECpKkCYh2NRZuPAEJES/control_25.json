I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend's cat to move in with them. The situation involves a conflict between the author's dislike of cats and the girlfriend's attachment to her cat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a dog person and has strong negative feelings towards cats, mentioning past bad experiences with scratches and bites. He's clear that the cat's presence would cause him significant stress. On the other hand, the girlfriend is firm that the cat comes with her, even suggesting it's a package deal. She's given an ultimatum, which complicates things.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and compromise in a relationship. The author is trying to communicate his feelings and boundaries, which is reasonable. However, the girlfriend's response seems rigid. The author's suggestion to have the cat live with her parents is a compromise, but she refused entirely. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong for standing his ground? Well, relationships require both parties to make adjustments. The author's request is about his personal comfort and well-being, which is valid. However, the girlfriend's refusal to consider alternatives might also be an issue. The author's response, playing hardball by not allowing the cat, is a firm stance but not necessarily wrong if he's communicated clearly and the compromise wasn't acceptable. \n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. The author could explore solutions like getting the cat declawed (though that's controversial) or setting up specific areas for the cat. However, the girlfriend's ultimatum leaves little room for negotiation. \n\nIn terms of fault, the girlfriend's all-or-nothing approach might be the bigger issue. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing his own comfort, especially since relationships should be reciprocal. So the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. However, I need to check if his approach is reasonable. He's not being unreasonable by not wanting a cat he's allergic or uncomfortable around. The girlfriend's refusal to compromise is a red flag, but the author's stance is justified.\n"
