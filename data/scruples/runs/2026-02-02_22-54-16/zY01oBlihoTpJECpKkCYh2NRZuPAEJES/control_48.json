I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation where he doesn't want his girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is a dog person and really dislikes cats. He has specific reasons like the cat's behavior (scratching, biting, noise) and the effort required to care for it. He's considering moving in with his girlfriend, who is very important to him, but he doesn't want the cat there. He's tried to discuss it, but she's firm, even giving an ultimatum.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Relationships often require compromise. The girlfriend has made it clear that she's not willing to give up the cat, which is a significant part of her life. The author is trying to communicate his needs but is facing resistance. The key points here are communication and mutual respect.\n\nThe author isn't being unreasonable about his dislike for cats, and he's expressed his concerns. The girlfriend, however, is holding her ground and even threatening the relationship. But the question is whether the author's stance makes him the asshole. \n\nHe's not asking her to get rid of the cat immediately but is setting a boundary for when they move in. It's about his living space and comfort. However, he's now considering a hardball approach, which could be seen as equally ultimatum-like. But was he wrong for having a preference about his home?\n\nIt's a balance. Both parties have needs. The girlfriend's refusal to compromise might be an issue, but the author is also standing his ground. It's possible that neither is entirely wrong. However, since the question is about the author's responsibility, perhaps he's not wrong for setting boundaries, but maybe he could have approached it differently. However, given that she's already given an ultimatum, his response might be a reaction to her stance.\n\nIn the end, it's a complex situation. The author isn't wrong for not wanting the cat in his home. People have preferences about their living environment. The real problem might be that both are taking firm stances without much flexibility. So, the answer might be B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
