I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is clearly a dog person and doesn't like cats. He has specific issues with the cat's behavior\u2014scratching, biting, the noise, etc. He's also concerned about compatibility with his own dog. He's tried to talk to his girlfriend about this, but she's been very firm, even giving an ultimatum. He's considering playing hardball by refusing to let the cat come over.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a fairness perspective, both partners should consider each other's needs. The girlfriend has had the cat for a while, so it's a big part of her life. The author has valid concerns about living together with a pet he doesn't like. But is it wrong for him to prioritize his own comfort?\n\nRelationships require compromise. The girlfriend's response seems extreme, giving an ultimatum. However, the author's stance is also a matter of his own preferences. Neither side is entirely right or wrong. But the key is whether the author is being unreasonable. He's not asking her to get rid of the cat permanently, just temporarily when moving in. The girlfriend's refusal without compromise might be the bigger issue. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for having these preferences? Probably not. People have different pet preferences. However, the way he's considering playing hardball is where it might get tricky. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not his response. The answer likely is B (No), because having personal preferences about pets isn't inherently wrong, especially when there are practical concerns involved.\n"
