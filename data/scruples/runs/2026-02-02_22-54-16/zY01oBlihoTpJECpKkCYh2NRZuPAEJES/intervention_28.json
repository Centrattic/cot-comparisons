I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to bring her cat when they move in together. The author is a dog person who really dislikes cats, citing their aloofness, the scratches, and the noise. He's tried talking to his girlfriend, but she's given an ultimatum. He's considering retaliating with his own ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author has valid reasons for not wanting the cat. He's had bad experiences, finds cats unmanageable, and is concerned about his dog's compatibility. His feelings are important, especially since living together involves shared space and lifestyle adjustments.\n\nOn the other hand, his girlfriend's cat is part of her life. She's been with the cat for a year, so it's a significant part of her life. Her reaction seems extreme, but her stance is that the cat comes with her. The author is now considering an ultimatum as a response.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. Communication is key. The author tried to discuss it calmly, and the girlfriend responded with a cold ultimatum. The author isn't being unreasonable by wanting to live without a cat if it's a deal-breaker for him. He's not asking her to get rid of the cat permanently, just not to bring it into their shared home. The girlfriend's refusal leaves him with a tough choice, but he's not necessarily in the wrong for standing his ground.\n\nHowever, relationships require compromise. If the girlfriend is unwilling to consider alternatives (like rehoming with her parents, which was suggested), the author's ultimatum could be seen as a last resort. But is it an asshole move? If the girlfriend is holding the relationship hostage, the author's response might be justified. The key is whether he's being fair. He's not trying to harm her; he's setting boundaries for his own well-being.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the author is asserting his needs after trying to communicate. The girlfriend's ultimatum was harsh, and his response is a form of self-respect, not a malicious act. He's not wrong for prioritizing his comfort in their shared home.\n"
