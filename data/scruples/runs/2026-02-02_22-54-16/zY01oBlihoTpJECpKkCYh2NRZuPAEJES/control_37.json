I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author doesn't want their girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in. They love dogs and hate cats, and the girlfriend is being very firm about not separating from her cat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has valid reasons. They've had negative experiences with cats, find them unmanageable, and their current dog might not get along. Their concern is about their own comfort and the well-being of their pet. On the other hand, the girlfriend has had the cat for a year and sees it as part of her life. She's not willing to part with it, which is understandable since pets are part of people's lives.\n\nThe key points here are communication and compromise. The author tried to discuss the issue, but the girlfriend responded with an ultimatum. The author is now considering a counter-ultimatum. Is that justified?\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and flexibility are important. The author's position is about their own needs, but the girlfriend's stance is also about her attachment to the cat. Neither side is entirely wrong, but the way the girlfriend reacted might be too rigid. However, the author's threat to rehome the cat if they move in could be seen as equally ultimatum-like, which might not be fair.\n\nBut the original question is if the author is in the wrong. The problem is that the girlfriend isn't willing to find a middle ground. The author is trying to express their needs and is being asked to accept something they strongly dislike. If the girlfriend is not open to any compromise, the author isn't necessarily wrong for setting boundaries. However, threatening to break up if the cat isn't rehomed could be seen as harsh. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting the cat. I think the answer leans towards B (No), because the author has a right to their preferences, and the girlfriend's refusal to compromise might be the bigger issue here.\n"
