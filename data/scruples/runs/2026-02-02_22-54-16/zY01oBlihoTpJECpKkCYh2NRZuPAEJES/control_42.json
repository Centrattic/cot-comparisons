I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their girlfriend's cat to move in with them. \n\nFirst, the author clearly states their dislike for cats, mentioning scratches, bites, and the cat's uncooperative nature. They've had dogs all their life and prefer that. The girlfriend is a big part of their life, and they see a future together, but the cat is a problem.\n\nThe author tried to discuss it with the girlfriend, suggesting maybe the cat could stay with her parents. The girlfriend responded with a cold ultimatum: either take the cat or break up. The author is now considering a counter-ultimatum.\n\nNow, the key points here are about mutual respect and compromise in a relationship. The author's stance is about personal comfort and well-being. Not wanting a pet that causes them stress is valid. However, the girlfriend's response seems extreme. Using a breakup as leverage over a pet can be seen as manipulative. \n\nThe question is whether the author's refusal to accommodate the cat is wrong. Since the author has legitimate reasons (comfort, safety with their dog, past negative experiences) and the girlfriend isn't willing to find a middle ground, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Both sides have valid points, but the girlfriend's ultimatum might be the bigger issue here. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their preferences and should not be forced to accept something that causes them significant discomfort. The girlfriend's response is more problematic.\n"
