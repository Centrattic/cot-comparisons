I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in. The author is a self-proclaimed dog person who has strong negative feelings towards cats, citing their aloofness, difficulty in training, and past experiences with scratches and bites. The girlfriend has been clear that the cat is part of the deal, and when the author suggests alternatives like the cat living with her parents, she's dismissive and issues an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of a relationship. Both partners should have their needs and boundaries respected. The author has a valid reason for not wanting a cat in their home\u2014it's a personal preference based on their experiences and personality. They've tried to communicate this calmly and rationally, which is good. The girlfriend's response is a bit extreme, though. Turning \"stone fucking cold\" and giving an ultimatum might not be healthy for the relationship. \n\nHowever, the author is now considering taking their own hardball stance by saying the girlfriend can't move in until she rehomes the cat. Is that fair? Well, the girlfriend's position is that the cat must come with her, so if the author is unwilling to compromise further, they might have to make a tough choice. But relationships often require compromise. If the author is willing to move in with the girlfriend but not the cat, they might need to find a middle ground. Maybe the cat can stay in a separate area, or the author can take some time to adjust to having the cat around. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's stance is non-negotiable. She's not open to alternatives, which could indicate that the cat is a significant part of her life and she's not willing to sacrifice it for the relationship. The author is in a position where they have to decide if this is a deal-breaker for them. If the author's discomfort with the cat is severe and they can't see a way to coexist, then their decision to hold the line isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's ultimatum is aggressive, but the author's refusal isn't an act of malice. They have their own valid preferences. It's about mutual respect. If the author is being unreasonable by not considering the girlfriend's feelings or the cat's place in her life, then maybe they are at fault. However, since the author has already tried to discuss it and the girlfriend isn't budging, the author's position is more about their own comfort and the well-being of their dog. \n\nI think the key here is that the author isn't being inflexible without reason. They've made their feelings clear, and the girlfriend is now making it an all-or-nothing situation. The author's option to not move in unless the cat is rehomed is a response to being given an ultimatum. Whether it's the \"asshole\" move depends on the context of their communication and the importance they place on each other's needs. But since the author is standing by their own boundaries, I'd say they're not wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
