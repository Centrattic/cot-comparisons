I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the details. The author is a guy who loves dogs and has a strong dislike for cats. His girlfriend has a cat, and he doesn't want the cat to move in with them when they start living together. He's tried talking to her, but she's been very firm, even giving an ultimatum. The author is considering playing hardball by saying she can't move in unless the cat is rehomed. He wants to know if he's in the wrong here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author has valid reasons based on his personal preferences and experiences with cats. He's had negative interactions, finds cats unmanageable, and is concerned about how his dog would react. It's his home, and he has the right to set boundaries about pets. On the other hand, the girlfriend has had the cat for a while, and it's part of her life. She might feel that the cat is a family pet now, and she's not willing to give it up. Her reaction being \"stone cold\" and an ultimatum suggests that she sees the cat as non-negotiable.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, both partners should communicate and find compromises. But when one partner is unwilling to budge and the other has a strong issue, it's a tough spot. The author is trying to be upfront about his feelings and future plans. He's not just being selfish; he's considering their long-term compatibility. The girlfriend's ultimatum is extreme because it's a major life decision and she's holding the relationship hostage. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is being unreasonable. He's not asking for anything extreme\u2014he's stating that he can't live with a cat. The girlfriend's refusal to even consider alternatives (like having the cat stay with her parents) is a problem. If she's not willing to compromise, maybe the author is justified in setting this boundary. \n\nBut relationships require give and take. If the author doesn't want the cat, but the girlfriend won't give it up, they might have a fundamental incompatibility. However, the author's approach of playing hardball might seem harsh, but given her ultimatum, maybe he's just responding to her tactics. \n\nSo, in terms of who's in the wrong, the girlfriend's ultimatum is problematic because it's a major decision without considering his feelings. The author is trying to be honest about his needs. He's not in the wrong for wanting to set boundaries. The girlfriend's inflexibility is the bigger issue here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
