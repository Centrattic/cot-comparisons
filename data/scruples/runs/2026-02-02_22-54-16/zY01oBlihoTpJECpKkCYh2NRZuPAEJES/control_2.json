I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong when they don't want their girlfriend's cat to move in with them. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is a dog person and really doesn't like cats. They have a dog and don't think the cat is a problem, but they themselves find cats annoying. The girlfriend has a cat, and when they talk about moving in together, the person wants the cat to not be there. They tried suggesting the cat could stay with her parents, but she refused, saying they're a package deal. Then, the girlfriend gave an ultimatum: either the cat comes too, or they break up. The person is now considering if it's an asshole move to counter with a hardball approach, making the girlfriend rehome the cat before moving in.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting the cat. Let me break down the key points.\n\nThe author's reasons: they dislike cats due to their behavior (scratching, biting, yowling, etc.), find them unaffectionate and hard to train compared to dogs. They've had negative experiences with cats. They care about their dog and are concerned about compatibility. The girlfriend's response was firm and even given an ultimatum, which the author is now questioning if they can counter.\n\nNow, I need to consider if the author is justified in their stance. Personal preferences about pets can be a significant issue in relationships. The author isn't saying the cat is bad, just that cats in general don't appeal to them. The girlfriend, on the other hand, loves her cat and views it as part of her life. The problem is whether the author is being unreasonable here.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, compromise is often necessary. The author wants the girlfriend to move in but without the cat, while the girlfriend sees the cat as non-negotiable. The author tried suggesting the cat stay with her parents, but she refused. The girlfriend's response seems to be that the cat is part of her life, and she's not willing to give it up. The author is now considering a counter-ultimatum, which is where the \"asshole\" aspect comes in.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for not wanting the cat? Well, it's their personal preference. They have a valid reason based on their experiences and dislike of cats. However, the girlfriend's attachment to her pet is also valid. In relationships, both partners should consider each other's comfort and well-being. If one person is uncomfortable having a pet that's part of the other's life, it's a legitimate issue. However, the girlfriend's ultimatum might be seen as extreme, but her stance is that the cat is part of her package. The author is now thinking of using a hardball approach, which could be seen as equally extreme.\n\nIn some cases, if the presence of the cat is causing significant stress or conflict, the author's position might be understandable. However, pets are often considered part of a person's life, and expecting someone to give up a pet could be seen as a big ask. On the other hand, the author's home is their space, and they have the right to set boundaries regarding their living environment.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's refusal is unreasonable. Since the cat isn't problematic in terms of behavior, but the author has a strong aversion to cats, it's a matter of personal preference. The girlfriend's insistence on keeping the cat is also a personal preference. The author might not be in the wrong for not wanting the cat, especially if it's affecting their well-being. However, the way they handle it matters. Using a hardball tactic in response to an ultimatum might escalate the conflict, but if the author feels that the cat's presence would make living together impossible, then their stance could be justified.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person acted inconsiderately or without empathy. The author tried to reason with the girlfriend and suggested a solution (parents' house), but the girlfriend was inflexible. The author's preference is valid, and if the girlfriend is unwilling to compromise, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries. However, the act of holding the relationship hostage with an ultimatum could be seen as harsh, but the author's response would also be a hardball move. Depending on the community's perspective, they might see the author as not in the wrong because they're standing up for their needs, even if it's a difficult choice.\n"
