I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether it's an asshole move for him to not want his girlfriend's cat to move in with them.\n\nFirst, the author is a dog person and really doesn't like cats. He has specific reasons: cats don't show affection the way dogs do, they're hard to train, and they've scratched or bitten him. He's been with his girlfriend almost a year and wants her to move in, but doesn't want the cat. He tried to talk to her about it, but she was firm, saying they're a package deal and even gave an ultimatum about breaking up if he doesn't accept the cat.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, people have different preferences about pets. The author is expressing his dislike for cats, which is his right. But relationships often require compromise. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is attached to her cat and isn't willing to give it up. She's clear that the cat is part of the deal, which might mean she's not willing to compromise on this issue. \n\nThe author is trying to communicate his needs, but she's not budging. If he's unwilling to compromise on this, he's not necessarily wrong. However, if he's the one who initially brought up the issue and she's standing her ground, maybe he's being unreasonable. But considering he's already made his stance clear and she's not listening, he might be justified in setting boundaries. The key here is mutual respect. If he's not willing to accept the cat, and she's not willing to rehome it, then both are at an impasse. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, using an ultimatum, which could indicate she's not open to discussion. The author is left with a tough choice. Whether he's in the wrong depends on societal views on pet ownership in relationships. Some might say that not wanting a pet your partner has is selfish, but others might say it's reasonable to have personal boundaries. Since he's not asking her to get rid of the cat immediately but is setting a condition for moving in together, it's a matter of negotiation. \n\nIn the end, the author isn't necessarily wrong for having his preferences. The girlfriend's refusal to compromise is her choice, but the author isn't obligated to accept something that causes him significant distress. So the answer is probably B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
