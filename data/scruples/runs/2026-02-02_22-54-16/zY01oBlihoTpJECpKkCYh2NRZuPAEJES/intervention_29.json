I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not wanting the girlfriend's cat to move in with them. The author is a dog person and really doesn't like cats. He's had issues with the cat when visiting the girlfriend's place, like scratches, bites, and noise. He wants her to move in but not bring the cat. When he tried to discuss it, she gave an ultimatum, making it a deal-breaker.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's reasons are valid. Personal preferences about pets can be tricky. If he's been clear from the start about not wanting cats, then it's reasonable. But if he never mentioned this before, maybe it's a new issue. The girlfriend seems to think that the cat is part of the package, which is understandable because she loves it. But relationships require compromise. \n\nThe author tried to talk about it calmly, but the girlfriend responded with a cold ultimatum. That's a big deal. If he's okay with ending the relationship rather than having a cat, is that fair? It depends on how integral the pets are to each person. Since the girlfriend is firm, maybe the author is being reasonable in standing his ground, especially if he's clear that this is a deal-breaker. \n\nBut wait, is there a middle ground? Maybe finding a place for the cat temporarily with her parents. The author suggested that, but she refused. If the girlfriend is not willing to compromise, then the author might not be in the wrong for walking away. However, using the cat as a deal-breaker might be seen as extreme. The key is whether the author communicated his stance early enough and if both are compromising. Since he's been open about his dislike and the girlfriend is equally firm, it's a tough spot. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's given her options and she's not budging. If she's holding the relationship hostage, he's justified in prioritizing his own needs. So the answer would be B.\n"
