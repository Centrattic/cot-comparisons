I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if it's an asshole move (AITA) for not allowing the girlfriend's cat to come when she moves in. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a dog person and has strong negative feelings towards cats. They mention having had bad experiences with scratches and bites, and they find cats unmanageable. The cat is described as average, but to the author, even average cats are problematic. The girlfriend is clearly attached to her cat, and when the author brings up the issue, she responds with a hard ultimatum.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and compromise in a relationship. The author is trying to communicate their discomfort with the cat, which is a valid concern given their history. The girlfriend, however, is unwilling to compromise, which could indicate that she hasn't considered the author's feelings as much as her own attachment to the cat. \n\nThe author is not saying they hate the cat entirely but is clear about their inability to coexist with it. The girlfriend's response of \"we're a package deal\" seems to put pressure on the author, making it a deal-breaker. If both parties can't find a middle ground, like finding a temporary arrangement for the cat or adopting it out, then it's a matter of whether the author is justified in their stance.\n\nIt's important to note that relationships require both parties to make compromises. If the author is willing to accept the girlfriend and her cat as part of moving in together, but the girlfriend isn't willing to consider alternatives, that could be an imbalance. However, the author is also standing up for their own needs and comfort. \n\nThe author's suggestion to rehome the cat might be a last resort, but it's a valid option if the girlfriend isn't open to negotiation. In this case, the author isn't wrong for setting a boundary, especially if their well-being is at stake. The girlfriend's ultimatum might be more extreme, but the author's stance is about their own tolerance for the situation.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They're expressing their valid concerns and trying to find a solution, even suggesting alternatives like the cat living with her parents. The girlfriend's refusal to budge makes her the more inflexible party here. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
