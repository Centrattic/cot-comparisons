I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple discussing moving in together, and the guy doesn't want the girlfriend's cat to come. They've been dating a year and he's considering marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author is a dog person and doesn't like cats, which is understandable. He has valid reasons: cats don't show affection like dogs, they scratch and bite, and the specific cat in question is causing him issues. He wants the girlfriend to move in but without the cat, which is a big deal for him.\n\nThe girlfriend, on the other hand, is firm about the cat coming along. She even gives an ultimatum, saying it's either both the cat and her moving in or breaking up. The author feels he's stuck and is considering playing hardball too.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. To answer that, I need to consider if his stance is unreasonable. He's clear about his dislike for cats and the specific problems he has. He tried to discuss it calmly and suggested alternatives like the cat living with her parents. She rejected that and made it an ultimatum.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to make compromises. But if one person's non-negotiable issue (like not wanting a cat) is met with the other's refusal to budge, leading to pressure to end the relationship, it's a problem. The girlfriend's ultimatum seems extreme. The author isn't asking her to give up the cat entirely, just to leave it with her parents. He's not wrong for not wanting to live with an animal he dislikes, especially if it's causing him stress and discomfort.\n\nHowever, the author's response of playing hardball might also be an issue. Threatening to rehome the cat could be seen as harsh, but if the girlfriend is holding the relationship hostage, he has valid grounds for pushing back. It's a tough spot either way. But in terms of being in the wrong, the key point is that he's stating his boundaries. He's not the one being unreasonable here. The girlfriend's ultimatum is more problematic because she's making it a deal-breaker without considering alternatives. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
