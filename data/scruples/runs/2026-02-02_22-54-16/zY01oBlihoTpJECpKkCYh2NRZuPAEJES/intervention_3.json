I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting their girlfriend's cat to move in with them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is a dog person and has a strong dislike for cats. They have a specific list of reasons: cats don't show affection, are hard to train, cause scratches and bites, and disrupt their space and sleep. The girlfriend is a cat person and seems very attached to her cat. When the author suggests the cat could stay with her parents, she responds with a cold ultimatum, saying she's a package deal with the cat. The author is considering whether to counter with an ultimatum about rehoming the cat.\n\nSo, the core issue is a conflict of preferences regarding pets. The author's dislike of cats is strong and specific. They mention that the cat is average but still problematic for them. The girlfriend's response is firm, which might indicate that the cat is a non-negotiable part of her life.\n\nNow, in terms of right or wrong. The author is expressing their own preferences and boundaries. It's reasonable for someone to have a pet that they don't like in their living space, especially if it's causing them distress. However, relationships require compromise. The author is trying to set a boundary, which is valid, but the girlfriend's response is an ultimatum, which is a form of leverage.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for not wanting the cat? Probably not, because personal preferences about pets can be strong. However, the author's response (threatening to make her rehome the cat) is a hardball approach. The girlfriend's ultimatum is also harsh. The question is whether the author is justified in their stance. Since the author has made their feelings known and the girlfriend isn't willing to compromise, the author's hardball response could be seen as self-defense. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The key here is whether the author's preference is reasonable. Since the author has clear reasons (specific issues with the cat's behavior, the stress it causes, etc.), their stance isn't unreasonable. The girlfriend's ultimatum is what's causing the conflict. The author is standing up for their own well-being. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
