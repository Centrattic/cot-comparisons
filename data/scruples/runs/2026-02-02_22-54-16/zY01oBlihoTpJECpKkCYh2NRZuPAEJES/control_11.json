I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in. The author is a dog person and has had issues with the cat's behavior, like scratches, bites, and the cat being a nuisance. They tried to discuss it with the girlfriend, but she reacted strongly, saying they're a package deal and giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the validity of the author's concerns. They mention the cat's behavior causing physical harm and annoyance. That's a legitimate issue, especially if the cat is a threat to their well-being or the dog's compatibility. Then there's the aspect of their living situation. When two people move in together, it's important to find compromises. The author is trying to communicate a boundary they feel strongly about.\n\nThe girlfriend's response seems to be an ultimatum without much room for discussion. She might value the cat highly, which is understandable since some people form strong bonds with their pets. However, using the relationship as a bargaining chip is a problem. The author is in a situation where they have to choose between their comfort and their relationship, which is a tough spot.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? They expressed their feelings and tried to reason. The girlfriend's reaction was to give a hard ultimatum. If the author's health or safety is at risk (like allergies or the cat being aggressive), that's a strong point. But even if it's just a matter of dislike, they have the right to set boundaries. The key here is mutual respect and finding a solution. Since the girlfriend isn't being flexible, the author might feel justified in holding their ground. Rehoming the cat is a last resort, but if compromise isn't possible, it could be necessary. The question is whether the author's stance is reasonable. I think it's more about the girlfriend's reaction being extreme rather than the author being in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
