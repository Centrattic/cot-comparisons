I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the boyfriend doesn't want his girlfriend's cat to move in with them. He's a dog person and has issues with cats\u2014scratches, bites, the cat's behavior. He tried to talk to her, but she's not budging, and she gave him an ultimatum. He's considering responding with his own ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key factors here are communication, mutual respect, and the importance of the pet to each person. The boyfriend has valid reasons based on his dislike of cats and specific issues with the cat's behavior. However, the girlfriend is very attached to her cat, viewing it as part of the \"package deal.\" \n\nIn relationships, finding compromises is essential. He suggested the cat could stay with her parents, but she refused. She then gave him an ultimatum, which is pretty harsh. On the other hand, the boyfriend is now considering his own ultimatum. The question is whether his position is reasonable or if he's overstepping.\n\nFrom a neutral standpoint, pets are often considered part of the family, so expecting a partner to rehome a pet can be a big ask. However, the boyfriend's concerns about cohabitation issues (like the cat's behavior affecting their life together) are legitimate. The girlfriend's refusal to even consider alternatives might indicate she's not willing to compromise, which could be a problem in the relationship's future. \n\nBut is the boyfriend in the wrong for not wanting the cat? It depends on how the situation is handled. If he's being reasonable and attempting to find middle ground, he's not in the wrong. However, if he's being inflexible and not considering her feelings, maybe. In this case, he did suggest a solution (the cat staying with her parents), which she rejected. His desire to have her move in without the cat is about their shared living space and his well-being. \n\nThe girlfriend's ultimatum is extreme, but the boyfriend's counter-ultimatum is a response to her stance. It's a tough spot, but if he's been clear and she's unwilling to negotiate, his response might be justified. However, using an ultimatum can be seen as harsh. But given her prior stance, maybe he's not in the wrong here. \n\nSo the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong), because he's standing by his boundaries after attempts to resolve it. The girlfriend's refusal to compromise could be the bigger issue. But I need to make sure I'm not missing something. The key is whether his stance is reasonable. Since he's tried to talk it out and she won't budge, his decision to hold firm isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
