I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a dog person and doesn't like cats at all. Their girlfriend has a cat, and they don't want the cat to move in with them when she does. The girlfriend is taking it as an ultimatum, saying either the cat comes too or they break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The author mentions they've been dating almost a year and see a future together. That's a significant commitment. Now, the issue is about whether it's reasonable for the author to not want the cat in their home. \n\nOn one hand, the author has valid reasons. They don't like cats, find them aloof, have had negative experiences with scratches and bites, and worry about their dog getting along with the cat. It's their home, and they have their preferences. It's reasonable for someone to have boundaries about pets, especially if they have a strong dislike. \n\nBut on the other hand, the girlfriend is taking it very seriously. She's saying they're a package deal, which could mean the cat is a big part of her life. Maybe she's had the cat for a long time, or it's important to her emotionally. The author is now being asked to either accept the cat or end the relationship. The author is feeling pressured and is considering playing hardball by making the girlfriend rehome the cat before moving in.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, in a relationship, both partners need to compromise. If the author's stance is rigid and not open to discussion, maybe they are being unreasonable. But if the girlfriend is not open to any alternatives, like maybe the cat staying with her parents part-time or finding temporary arrangements, then she might be the one being inflexible. \n\nThe author tried to suggest the cat could live with her parents, but she rejected that. The author is now at a point where they feel forced to choose. The question is whether it's fair for the author to set a boundary about not having the cat in their home. If the author is willing to compromise on other things but this is a non-negotiable issue for them, it's not necessarily wrong. People have different tolerances and preferences. \n\nHowever, the author's approach might come off as dismissive of the girlfriend's feelings for the cat. But if the author has clearly communicated their feelings and the girlfriend is not willing to meet them halfway, then the author isn't entirely in the wrong. Relationships require mutual respect and compromise, and if one person isn't willing to budge, it's a problem for both sides.\n\nSo, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to set boundaries in their own home. However, the way they handle it (playing hardball) could be seen as an asshole move if they're not considering the girlfriend's feelings. But the question is specifically if the author is in the wrong. Since they're standing up for their own preferences and the girlfriend is being inflexible, maybe the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
