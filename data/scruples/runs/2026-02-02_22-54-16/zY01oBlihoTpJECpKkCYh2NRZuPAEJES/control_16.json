I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend's cat to move in with them. Let's break down the details.\n\nThe author is a dog person and doesn't like cats. He's had bad experiences with cats, getting scratched and bitten. He's in a serious relationship, almost a year, and considering marriage. The girlfriend's cat is average, but he finds cats annoying. He tried to discuss moving the cat to her parents' house but she refused. She gave an ultimatum: both the cat and her move in, or break up.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if his reasons are valid. Disliking cats is personal preference. But the issue is about living together. If the cat is causing him stress or conflict, that's a legitimate concern. However, he's making a big life decision (moving in and possibly marriage) based on this. Is it reasonable to expect a partner to rehome a pet, especially if they love the pet?\n\nThe girlfriend's response is firm. She sees the cat as part of her life, so she's not willing to give it up. Relationships require compromise. The author's stance is a significant ask\u2014he's asking her to get rid of a pet she loves. But he's also dealing with his own discomfort. Is it fair to expect her to rehome the cat, or should he try to find a middle ground?\n\nMaybe there are alternatives. Could the cat live somewhere else temporarily? The parents are nearby. Maybe the author could work on getting used to the cat or finding a way to manage the situation. But he says he's tried and she's unwilling. If she's holding the relationship hostage, that's a problem. But the author is also setting a hard line. \n\nIs the author wrong? It depends on whether his stance is reasonable. If the cat is a deal-breaker for him, and he's communicated it, maybe he's not wrong. But if he's being inflexible without trying other solutions, that could be an issue. However, the girlfriend isn't budging either. So it's a conflict of priorities. Both have valid points. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. Probably not, because his preferences are valid. But is it an asshole move? Maybe not, because he's trying to be upfront. However, the ultimatum he's considering (playing hardball) might be seen as extreme. But given her stance, maybe he's justified. So the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
