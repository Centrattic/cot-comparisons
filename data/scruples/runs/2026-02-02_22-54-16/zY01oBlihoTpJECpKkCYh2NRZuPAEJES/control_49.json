I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author is a dog person who doesn't like cats at all. His girlfriend has a cat, and he doesn't want it to come when she moves in. He's tried to talk to her, but she's being really firm, even giving an ultimatum. The question is whether he's the asshole for standing his ground.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has legitimate reasons: he's had bad experiences with cats, finds them unmanageable, and his dog might not get along. His main issue isn't the cat's behavior but his own discomfort and dislike. On the other hand, the girlfriend loves the cat and sees it as part of their relationship. She's using an ultimatum, which is pretty strong.\n\nIs it fair for the author to ask her to rehome the cat? Well, pets can be a significant part of someone's life. If the author can't accept her having a cat, it might indicate a deeper issue about accepting her as she is. However, if moving in together means accommodating each other's preferences, maybe he's within his rights to set a boundary.\n\nBut wait, the girlfriend's response was extreme. She turned cold and gave an ultimatum, which could be seen as holding the relationship hostage. The author is now considering doing the same. The question is whether he's in the wrong for pushing back. If she's unwilling to compromise, maybe he's justified in setting a boundary, especially if he's clear about his stance from the start. However, if the cat is part of her life and he's not willing to accept that, it might be a dealbreaker. But is he in the wrong? It depends on whether the request is reasonable. Since the cat is part of her life, expecting her to rehome it is a big ask. However, the girlfriend's ultimatum is also harsh. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't wrong for stating his preferences, but the girlfriend's response is problematic. However, the author's solution (playing hardball) might be seen as equally harsh. The answer might be that it's not the author's fault entirely, but the situation is complicated. The key points are mutual compromise. If she's unwilling to find a middle ground, like fostering the cat temporarily or finding a solution that works for both, then the author isn't wrong in setting a boundary. But if the cat is a non-negotiable part of her life, then the author's stance could be seen as selfish. However, the girlfriend's ultimatum is more extreme, so the balance might tip towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
