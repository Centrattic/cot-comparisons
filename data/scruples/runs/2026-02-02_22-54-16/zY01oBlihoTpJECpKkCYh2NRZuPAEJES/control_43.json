I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy doesn't like cats at all and doesn't want his girlfriend's cat to move in with them. He loves his dog and has had dogs all his life, but cats are a problem for him. He's even had negative experiences with cats, like scratches and bites. He's tried to discuss it with his girlfriend, but she's taking it as an ultimatum\u2014either the cat comes or they break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has valid reasons: his dislike of cats is strong, and he's worried about compatibility with his dog and his own comfort. On the other hand, the girlfriend has had the cat, and she sees it as part of her life. She's not willing to rehome it, which could be because she's attached or maybe the cat is a part of her routine.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author tried to talk it out, but she responded with a harsh ultimatum. That seems like she's not considering his feelings and is making it about her needs only. The question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting the cat. Since he's clear about his feelings and tried to find a solution (like the cat staying with her parents), but she's not budging, maybe he's not in the wrong. But maybe he is if his stance is too rigid without considering her attachment.\n\nBut wait, the girlfriend's response seems extreme. Holding the relationship hostage over the cat might be more her issue. The author is standing by his own preferences, which are reasonable. It's a matter of whether you can ask someone to accept a pet they strongly dislike. If the relationship is moving towards cohabitation, both parties should have certain boundaries. The author isn't asking her to give up the cat entirely (he suggested her parents), but she won't compromise. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. He's being honest about his feelings and setting a boundary. The problem is her response, not his stance.\n"
