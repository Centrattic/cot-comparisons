I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend's cat to live with them when they move in. \n\nFirst, the author clearly states his dislike for cats, which is valid. He's had negative experiences with cats, like scratches and bites, and feels they don't show affection. He's a dog person and his current dog is his best friend. The girlfriend, however, loves her cat and sees it as part of the package. \n\nThe key point here is their relationship. They've been dating almost a year and are considering marriage. The author wants her to move in but not the cat. The girlfriend responds with an ultimatum, saying they have to take the cat or break up. The author is now considering a similar hardball approach.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, having strong preferences about pets in a relationship is common. The author is being honest about his feelings, which is important. However, the girlfriend's reaction is extreme. Setting a breakup ultimatum over a pet is a significant move. The author tried to discuss it calmly and suggested alternatives, like the cat staying with her parents. The girlfriend didn't consider those solutions and instead made it an all-or-nothing situation. \n\nThe author's consideration of rehoming the cat is a response to her ultimatum. It's a hard choice, but he's trying to find a compromise. Since the issue is about mutual living arrangements, both sides need to negotiate. The girlfriend's refusal to budge might be the bigger problem here. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. He's communicated his feelings and tried to find a middle ground. The girlfriend's response is more rigid. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
