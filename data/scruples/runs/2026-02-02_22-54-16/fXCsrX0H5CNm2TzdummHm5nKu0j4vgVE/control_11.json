I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if they're the asshole for disagreeing with the idea that money doesn't matter when having a child. They mention their parents and friends said money isn't a factor, but they and their girlfriend want to wait until they're financially stable. The key points are whether financial stability is relevant to having a child and if the author is wrong for thinking otherwise.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common arguments. Some people might say that love and care are what's important, not money. But others argue that financial stability can significantly impact a child's well-being. The author's stance is that they want to plan for a child when they can support them financially, which seems reasonable. The friends and parents might be emphasizing emotional readiness over financial aspects, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong to prioritize financial stability. \n\nI should also think about the potential consequences. If a child is born into financial instability, it could lead to stress, limited access to education, healthcare, etc. The author is trying to avoid those issues by planning ahead. Their girlfriend agrees, so it's a mutual decision. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). From a general perspective, wanting to be financially ready is a common and prudent approach. So, the author isn't necessarily the asshole here. The answer is B.\n"
