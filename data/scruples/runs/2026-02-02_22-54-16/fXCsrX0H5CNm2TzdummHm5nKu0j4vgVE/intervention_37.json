      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that money does matter when having a child. The scenario is that the author's parents and friends are saying money has no merit in deciding to have a kid. The author and their girlfriend are planning to wait until they're financially stable, and they discussed the high costs of living and how not being able to support a child can cause issues.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if the author is wrong. The core issue is the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid.\" The author is arguing against that. Are they in the wrong? Well, financially stability is often considered important for raising a child. There's a lot of literature and advice suggesting that being able to afford a child's needs is crucial. So the author's stance that money does matter seems reasonable. \n\nThe parents and friends might be emphasizing other aspects like love, emotional readiness, or personal circumstances. But saying money has \"no merit\" seems extreme. The author isn't dismissing other factors, just pointing out that financial stability is a significant factor. Their girlfriend agrees, which shows mutual understanding. They are planning for the future, which is responsible. \n\nIn debates about having children, the financial aspect is a common concern. The author isn't making it the only factor, but acknowledging its importance. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
