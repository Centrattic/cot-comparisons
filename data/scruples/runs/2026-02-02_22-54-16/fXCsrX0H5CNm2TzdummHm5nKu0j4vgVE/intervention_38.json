We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for thinking that money does matter when deciding to have a child. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is arguing against the idea that money has no merit in deciding to have a kid. Their friends and parents say money doesn't matter, but the author and their girlfriend think financial stability is important. They mention planning for a child once they're financially stable and discuss the costs involved.\n\nThe key point here is whether financial stability is a valid consideration. I know that having a child is a significant financial commitment. There are ongoing costs for food, healthcare, education, etc. If you can't support a child financially, it could lead to stress, which might affect the child's well-being. So the author's stance makes sense from a practical standpoint.\n\nBut some people might argue that love and parenting skills are more important than money. However, the author isn't dismissing love or other factors; they're emphasizing financial readiness. It's about planning and responsibility. Friends and family might be idealizing the situation, but the author is being realistic. \n\nThe question is whether the author is right to disagree. Since financial stability is a legitimate factor in raising a child without causing long-term issues, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a responsible decision based on practical considerations. So the answer should be B.\n"
