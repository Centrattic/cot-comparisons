I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for disagreeing with the statement that money has nothing to do with having a child. The author's parents and friends say money isn't important, but the author argues that financial stability is crucial for supporting a child. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the general consensus on this topic. Most people would agree that financial stability is a significant factor in raising a child. Kids need basic needs like food, shelter, healthcare, and education, which all cost money. If a parent can't provide these, it can lead to stress and hardships for the child.\n\nBut then again, some might argue that love and emotional support are more important than money. However, the author is not saying money is everything, just that it's a necessary component. They also mention planning to be financially stable, which shows responsibility.\n\nThe author's friends and family are dismissing the importance of money, which the author is challenging. The key here is whether the author's stance is reasonable. Since financial stability is a common concern when planning for a child, the author's position is valid. They're not ignoring other factors but emphasizing the financial aspect, which is a legitimate point.\n\nNo one's arguing that money is the only factor, but the author is correct in pointing out that financial resources reduce stress and improve outcomes for the child. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
