      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for thinking that money does matter when deciding to have a child. Their parents and friends say that money isn't important, but the user and their girlfriend (who's 22) disagree. They want to wait until they're financially stable to have a kid because they believe not being able to support a child financially can cause long-term issues. The friends and family are telling them that money has no merit in this decision, but the user is pushing back.\n\nThe user is asking if they're wrong for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments on both sides. On one hand, the friends and family are saying money isn't a factor. That could be based on the idea that love, care, and emotional stability are more important. They might believe that with enough dedication, you can raise a child regardless of financial status. On the other hand, the author and their girlfriend argue that financial stability is crucial because of the high costs of raising a child, and not being prepared can lead to problems.\n\nFinancial stability is a common consideration for people planning a family. Studies do show that economic factors significantly impact a child's well-being. If a family can't meet basic needs like food, housing, healthcare, and education, it can affect the child's development. So the author's stance is based on practical considerations. \n\nHowever, some might counter that while money is important, it's not the only factor. But the question is whether the author is wrong for dismissing the idea that money has no merit. The author isn't denying other factors but is emphasizing the financial aspect. The friends and family might be oversimplifying by saying money has nothing to do with it. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's position is unreasonable. The author is not saying money is the only thing, but that it's a significant factor. Given that preparing financially is a responsible approach, the author is likely justified in their view. Therefore, the answer would be B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
