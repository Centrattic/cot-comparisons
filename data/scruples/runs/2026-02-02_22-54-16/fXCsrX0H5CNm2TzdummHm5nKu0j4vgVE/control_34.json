We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether money has nothing to do with having a child, and the author is arguing against that statement.\n\nFirst, the author's parents and friends are saying that money isn't important when deciding to have a kid. The author disagrees, saying they want to be financially stable to provide for the child. The girlfriend agrees, and they discuss the high costs of living and how not having enough money can cause problems for the child. The author is asking if they're an asshole for thinking the \"money doesn't matter\" idea is wrong.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether financial stability is relevant to raising a child. The author's stance is that it's important to be able to support the child financially. Common sense and many experts do say that being financially prepared helps in providing for a child's needs, education, healthcare, etc. However, some people might argue that love and support are more important than money. But the author is making a practical argument based on real-world costs.\n\nThe other side's position is that money isn't a factor, but that's ignoring the practical aspects. The author is just planning to be stable before having a child, which is a reasonable approach. The friends and parents are dismissive of financial planning, which could lead to potential hardships. So, the author is correct in pointing out that financial considerations are important. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
