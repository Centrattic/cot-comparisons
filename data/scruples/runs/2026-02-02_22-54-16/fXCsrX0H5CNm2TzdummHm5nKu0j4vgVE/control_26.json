I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for disagreeing with their parents and friends who say money isn't important when deciding to have a kid. The author and their girlfriend want to wait until they're financially stable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The friends and parents argue that money doesn't matter for having a child. The author thinks otherwise, citing the high cost of living and potential issues if a child isn't supported financially. \n\nFinancial stability is often recommended when considering parenthood. Studies show that economic hardship can affect a child's well-being. The author isn't dismissing the emotional or other aspects, just the financial planning part. Their friends and parents might be emphasizing that love and support are more critical than money, which is true, but that doesn't negate the importance of financial readiness.\n\nThe author is standing by their decision to plan financially, which is a responsible approach. They're not saying money is the only factor, just that it's a significant one. The friends' statement that money has nothing to do with it seems overly simplistic. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
