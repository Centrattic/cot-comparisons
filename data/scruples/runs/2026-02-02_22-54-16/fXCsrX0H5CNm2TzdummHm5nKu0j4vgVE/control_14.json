I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The situation is that the author is arguing that money does matter when deciding to have a child, while their parents and friends say it doesn't. The author and their girlfriend want to be financially stable before having a kid, considering the costs and potential issues if they can't support the child.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's position is wrong. The key points here are the financial aspect of raising a child and the validity of considering it. The author isn't saying money is the only factor, but that it's an important one. The friends and family are dismissing the financial aspect entirely, which the author disagrees with.\n\nFinancial stability can definitely impact a child's upbringing. Studies show that economic hardship can affect a child's development, access to education, healthcare, etc. The author is planning to ensure they can provide for the child, which seems responsible. The friends' stance that money doesn't matter might be idealistic but isn't realistic. The author isn't being selfish; they're prioritizing the child's well-being by being prepared. So the author's reasoning is sound. Therefore, the answer is B (Not the Asshole).\n"
