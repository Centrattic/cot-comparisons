I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for disagreeing with the statement that money has nothing to do with having a child. The author argues that financial stability is important for providing for a child, while others say money isn't a factor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments. The author's stance is practical: financial stability affects a child's well-being, access to resources, and long-term outcomes. There's research showing that economic factors influence child development, so there's some merit there. On the other hand, people who say money isn't important might be emphasizing love, emotional support, or non-material aspects. But can those be adequately provided without financial means? For example, if a parent can't afford healthcare or a stable home, that's a problem.\n\nThe author and their girlfriend want to plan financially before having a child. That seems responsible. The friends and parents might be dismissing practical considerations, which could lead to challenges. The key here is whether the author's reasoning is valid. Since financial readiness is a common recommendation in parenting advice, the author's position isn't unreasonable. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If someone argues that financial stability is necessary and others say money doesn't matter, the author isn't being an asshole for valuing practical planning. So the answer is B.\n"
