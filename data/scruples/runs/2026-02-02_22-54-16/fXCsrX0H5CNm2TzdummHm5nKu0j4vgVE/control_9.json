      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for disagreeing with their parents and friends who say money isn't important when deciding to have a child. The author argues that financial stability is crucial to provide for the child and avoid long-term issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common perspectives on this. Many people do believe that financial readiness is important for raising a child, as kids have needs like food, healthcare, education, and a safe environment. On the other hand, some might argue that love and support are more important than money. But the author is countering the idea that money doesn't matter at all.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is wrong for valuing financial stability. Since the question is about whether they're an asshole (AITA), we look at if their stance is unreasonable. The author's reasoning is practical\u2014they want to plan and ensure they can support the child. Their girlfriend agrees, which shows mutual understanding. The friends and parents seem to dismiss financial considerations entirely, which could be seen as neglecting a real aspect of child-rearing.\n\nSo, the author isn't wrong. They're prioritizing practical aspects, which is a valid viewpoint. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
