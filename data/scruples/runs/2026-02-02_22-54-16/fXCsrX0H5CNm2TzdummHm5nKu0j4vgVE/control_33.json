      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about whether having a child has anything to do with money. The author is saying that money does matter, and their parents and friends are telling them that money has no merit in deciding to have a kid. The author wants to wait until they're financially stable, and their girlfriend agrees.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the general consensus on this topic. I know that there's a lot of debate about whether you need to be rich to have a kid, but most experts would say that financial stability is important. Kids are expensive, and not having enough money can lead to stress, which affects the child's well-being. So the author's reasoning seems valid.\n\nThe people around the author are saying money doesn't matter, which might be a more idealistic or emotional viewpoint. They might be emphasizing love, emotional readiness, or other factors over financial aspects. But the author is pointing out the practical side\u2014like living costs and the long-term impact of not being able to support a child. \n\nIs it wrong to think that money is a factor? Well, the question is whether the author is the asshole for disagreeing. From what I know, it's reasonable to consider financial stability when planning a family. So the author isn't wrong here. Their friends and family might be missing the point, but that doesn't make the author in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the author's intention is to provide for their future child, which is a responsible stance. The friends' argument that money isn't important could be naive, especially given the high costs associated with raising a child. So, the author is justified in their position. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
