      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking that money does matter when deciding to have a child. The author is arguing against the idea that money is irrelevant, saying they want to be financially stable before having a kid, and their girlfriend agrees. Their friends and parents are saying money isn't important, and the author is being called an asshole for disagreeing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points here. The key issue is the role of financial stability in deciding to have children. The author believes it's important, others say it's not. The question is whether the author is wrong for holding that view.\n\nI know that having a child is a significant financial commitment. Basic needs like food, clothing, housing, healthcare, education all add up. There are also unexpected expenses. If a parent isn't financially stable, it can lead to stress, which affects the child's well-being. Studies often show that financial strain can impact family dynamics and child development. So the author's concern seems valid.\n\nOn the other hand, some people might argue that love and emotional support are more important. But the author is not saying money is the only factor, just that it's a necessary consideration. They mention planning to be financially stable, which shows responsibility. Their girlfriend agrees, so it's a mutual decision.\n\nThe friends and parents might be coming from a place where they think financial issues can be managed or that having a child can motivate financial planning. However, the author's stance is about responsible planning to avoid long-term issues for the child. It's a common debate, but I think the author is justified in their view. They're not dismissing love or non-financial aspects, just emphasizing the importance of financial preparedness.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong for thinking money matters in this context.\n"
