I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for disagreeing with the idea that money isn't important when deciding to have a child. The author argues that financial stability matters for supporting a child, and the girlfriend agrees. Their friends and parents say money shouldn't matter, but the author thinks that's ignoring real financial challenges.\n\nHmm, so the core issue is whether financial considerations are valid when planning to have a child. The author is standing by their stance, and the others are dismissing it. I need to determine if the author is right to think they're not the asshole here.\n\nWell, having kids is a big responsibility, and financial stability can affect the child's well-being. It's reasonable to plan financially before having a child. The author's friends and parents might be saying that love and non-material factors are more important, but that doesn't negate the practical aspects. The author isn't denying love's role; they're just emphasizing the importance of being able to provide. So the author's position seems rational. Their friends might be idealistic, but the author isn't wrong for considering practicalities. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
