I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for arguing that money is important when deciding to have a child. The author's parents and friends say money doesn't matter, but the author and their girlfriend disagree, emphasizing financial stability to support a child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common advice on this topic. Most experts suggest that financial stability is a key factor in raising a child. Being financially secure can reduce stress for parents and provide better resources for the child's upbringing. The author is planning to wait until they're stable, which aligns with this advice.\n\nThe friends and parents who say money doesn't matter might be making a statement that it's possible to have a child without a lot of money, which is true in some cases. However, the author is pointing out that financial instability can lead to long-term issues for the child, which is a valid concern. There's a difference between saying money isn't everything and acknowledging that financial strain can be harmful.\n\nThe author isn't dismissing the importance of love and other factors; they're highlighting that financial planning is crucial. Their stance is reasonable because it's about practical preparation. The friends and parents might not be considering the potential negative impacts of financial instability. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a logical argument based on real-world challenges. The answer should be B, No.\n"
