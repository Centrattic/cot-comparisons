I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether financial stability is important before having a child. The author argues that money does matter, and their girlfriend agrees. Their parents and friends say money has no merit in this decision. The user is asking if the author is the asshole for thinking the money statement is bullshit.\n\nFirst, I should consider the common arguments around this topic. Some people say that love and care are what matter most for a child, not financial status. On the other hand, financial stability can affect the quality of life, access to education, healthcare, and other necessities. So, the author's stance is that planning financially is important to avoid long-term issues. \n\nThe question is whether it's wrong to prioritize financial stability. I think it's reasonable for parents to want to be in a good financial position to provide for their child. There's a lot of research showing that economic hardship can impact a child's well-being. However, some might argue that it's possible to raise a child without a lot of money if there's sufficient support and resourcefulness.\n\nBut the author isn't saying money is everything. They're saying it's a factor in planning. Their friends and parents might be dismissing a legitimate concern. The author's goal is to ensure they can support the child, which seems responsible. So, I don't think the author is in the wrong. They're making a logical point about the practical aspects of raising a child. The answer should be B.\n"
