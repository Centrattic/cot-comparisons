I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that money matters when considering having a child. Their parents and friends say money isn't a factor, but the author and their girlfriend believe financial stability is important.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common arguments on both sides. On one hand, some people argue that love and emotional support are more important than money in raising a child. They might say that financial issues can be managed and that lack of money doesn't necessarily lead to bad parenting. On the other hand, there's a strong case that financial stability reduces stress, provides better living conditions, and ensures access to resources like healthcare, education, and a safe environment for the child. Studies do show that financial stress can impact family dynamics and child development.\n\nThe author's reasoning is based on practical concerns\u2014planning for the child's needs, avoiding long-term issues. Their friends and family might be emphasizing that with love and effort, financial challenges can be overcome. But the author is pointing out the tangible costs of raising a child, which can't be ignored. \n\nI should also consider societal perspectives. Many experts recommend financial planning before having children. However, life is unpredictable, and unexpected financial hardships can arise even if you're stable now. But the author's stance is about wanting to be prepared, which is a responsible approach. \n\nIs the author wrong for valuing financial stability? Probably not. It's a valid concern. The friends and family might be oversimplifying by saying money doesn't matter. So the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
