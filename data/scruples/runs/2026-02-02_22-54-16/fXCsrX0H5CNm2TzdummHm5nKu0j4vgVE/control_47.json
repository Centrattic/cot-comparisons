I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for disagreeing with their parents and friends who say that money has nothing to do with having a child. The author argues that financial stability is important for providing for a child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common arguments around financial preparedness for parenthood. Many sources do suggest that financial stability is crucial because raising a child involves significant costs\u2014infant care, education, healthcare, etc. Without financial stability, there could be stress on the parents and potential neglect of the child's needs.\n\nOn the other hand, some people might argue that love and emotional readiness are more important than money. But the author's point is about planning and avoiding long-term issues. Their girlfriend agrees with them, which adds credibility to their stance. The friends and parents dismissing money's role might be oversimplifying the situation.\n\nI should also think about societal norms and general advice. Most child-rearing guides recommend considering financial aspects. So, if the author is advocating for financial planning, they're aligning with widely accepted advice. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for emphasizing the importance of financial stability. The answer should be B.\n"
