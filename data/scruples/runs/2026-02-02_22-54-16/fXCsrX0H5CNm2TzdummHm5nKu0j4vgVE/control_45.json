I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that money does matter when deciding to have a child. The situation is that the author and their girlfriend both agree that financial stability is important to provide for a child, but their parents and friends say money isn't a factor. The author is questioning if they're the asshole for disagreeing.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the common arguments on both sides. On one hand, some people might argue that love and care are more important than money, and that you can't predict the future finances. On the other hand, financial stability can reduce stress, provide better opportunities for the child, and ensure basic needs are met. \n\nThe author is planning to wait until they're financially stable. That's a responsible approach. Their friends and family are saying money doesn't matter, but the author is countering with practical concerns about costs and long-term issues. \n\nI should consider if there's a cultural or societal aspect here. In some cultures, financial stability is emphasized more for having children. Also, studies show that financial stress can impact parenting and child development. So the author's stance has some validity.\n\nIs the author wrong? If they're arguing that money is a factor, but others say it isn't, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. Because it's reasonable to consider financial aspects when planning a family. Their friends and parents might be oversimplifying. The key here is whether the author's position is unreasonable. Since they're planning ahead and their partner agrees, it's a responsible decision. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
