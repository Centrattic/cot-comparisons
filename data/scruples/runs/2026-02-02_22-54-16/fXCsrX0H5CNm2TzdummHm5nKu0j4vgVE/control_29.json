      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking money matters when having a kid.\n\nThe situation is that the author's parents and friends say money isn't important for having a child. The author disagrees, arguing that financial stability is crucial to provide for the child and prevent long-term issues. The author's girlfriend agrees. They discussed the high costs involved. The question is whether the author is the asshole (AITA) for disagreeing with the \"money has nothing to do with it\" statement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The friends and family might believe that love and care are more important than money. They might think that financial stability isn't a requirement because people can manage even with less. On the other hand, the author is concerned about the practical aspects\u2014like being able to afford the child's needs, education, healthcare, and a stable environment. Financial instability can lead to stress, which affects parenting and the child's well-being. There's a lot of data showing that economic factors influence child outcomes, like access to education, health care, and overall development.\n\nThe author is planning to wait until they're financially stable, which is a responsible approach. The friends and family might not be considering the real-life implications of financial hardship on raising a child. The author's stance is about practical preparation and avoiding situations that could harm the child. The key here is that the author isn't dismissing the importance of love and care but is emphasizing the necessity of financial capability. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If being in the wrong means that financial stability isn't important, then no. The author is just advocating for a realistic approach. The friends and family might be idealizing the situation, while the author is being pragmatic. The author isn't saying money is the only factor, but that it's a significant one. So, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
