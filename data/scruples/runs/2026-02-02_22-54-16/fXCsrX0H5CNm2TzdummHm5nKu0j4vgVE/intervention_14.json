We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking that money is important when having a child. The parents and friends say money has no merit in this decision, but the author disagrees and wants to be financially stable first. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments on both sides. The author's side is that financial stability is crucial for providing for a child, which makes sense because kids need food, shelter, healthcare, education, etc. Being in a better financial position can reduce stress and improve the child's opportunities. The parents and friends argue that money isn't important, maybe emphasizing love, emotional readiness, or other factors over financial aspects.\n\nBut does that make the author wrong? Well, financial stability is a commonly cited factor in responsible parenting. Studies and experts often mention financial preparedness as part of being ready for a child. So the author's concern is valid. The friends and parents might be oversimplifying by saying money has nothing to do with it. However, it's possible they're making a point that money isn't the only factor, which is true. But the author's statement isn't dismissing other factors entirely; they're emphasizing financial stability as part of the equation.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is wrong for valuing financial stability. Since financial readiness is widely recognized as important, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a responsible choice to plan for a child when they can provide adequately. The friends and parents might be right in that love and other factors matter, but that doesn't negate the importance of financial aspects. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
