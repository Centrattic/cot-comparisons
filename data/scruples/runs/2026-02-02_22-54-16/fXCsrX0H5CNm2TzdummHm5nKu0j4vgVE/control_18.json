I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking money matters when deciding to have a child. The author's parents and friends say money doesn't matter, but the author disagrees, wanting to be financially stable first. So, the main question is whether the author is wrong to prioritize financial stability.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the arguments. The author and their girlfriend want to plan for a child once they're financially stable. They mention the high costs of living and how not being able to support a child can lead to long-term issues. Their friends and family argue that money isn't a factor. \n\nI know that having a child is a significant financial commitment. There are costs for healthcare, education, housing, etc. Financial stability can reduce stress and provide better opportunities for the child. On the other hand, some might argue that love and support are more important than money. But the author's point is that not being financially prepared can cause problems.\n\nI think the author is reasonable in wanting to ensure they can provide. Financial stability can help in giving the child a better start in life. So, the author isn't wrong for considering money as a factor. The friends and family might be idealistic, but the author's perspective is practical. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
