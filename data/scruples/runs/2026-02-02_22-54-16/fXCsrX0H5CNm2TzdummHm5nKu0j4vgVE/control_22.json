I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking money does matter when having a child. The author is M23, their girlfriend is F22, and they want to wait until financially stable. Their friends and parents say money isn't important. The author argues that financial stability is crucial to avoid long-term issues for the child.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's stance is unreasonable. The question is whether money has nothing to do with child-reasing. The author's argument is valid because financial stability affects a child's well-being\u2014affording basic needs, healthcare, education, etc. Studies show that financial stress can impact parenting and child development. So, prioritizing financial stability is a responsible approach.\n\nOn the other hand, the friends and parents might argue that love and support are more important than money. While that's true, that doesn't negate the practical aspects of financial responsibility. The author isn't dismissing emotions or love; they're emphasizing practical planning. The key point here is that the author isn't wrong to consider financial factors. They're making a logical decision based on real-world implications.\n\nThe friends and parents might be oversimplifying by saying money has no merit. The author's reasoning is sound. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
