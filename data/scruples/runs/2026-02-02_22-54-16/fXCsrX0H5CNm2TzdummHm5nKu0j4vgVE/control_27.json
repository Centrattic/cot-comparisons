      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for disagreeing with their parents and friends who say money doesn't matter when having a kid. The author argues that financial stability is important to support a child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common arguments around this topic. Many people emphasize financial stability as crucial for a child's well-being. Being able to afford basic needs like food, housing, education, and healthcare is often seen as a responsible approach. The author and their girlfriend plan to have a child once they're financially stable, which is a practical stance.\n\nOn the other hand, their friends and family might believe that love and emotional support are more important than money. While that's a valid perspective, the author's concern is about the practical aspects. The question is whether the author is wrong for thinking money matters. \n\nI should also think about the potential consequences. If a family can't provide financially, it can lead to stress, which affects both parents and the child. Studies often show that financial stress can impact child development. So, the author's point isn't without merit.\n\nThe friends and parents are saying money has no merit, but the author is countering with real financial considerations. The key here is whether the author is wrong for valuing financial readiness. Since there's no clear right or wrong, but the author's reasoning is logical and supported by real-world factors, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
