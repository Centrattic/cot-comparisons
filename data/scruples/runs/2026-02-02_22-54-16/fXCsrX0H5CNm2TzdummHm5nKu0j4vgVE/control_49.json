      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether having a child is unrelated to money. The author is arguing against their parents and friends who say money doesn't matter when deciding to have a kid. The author wants to wait until they're financially stable to provide for the child, and their girlfriend agrees. They mention the high costs of living and how not being financially stable can lead to long-term issues for the child. The user is asking if the author is the asshole for thinking that money does matter.\n\nFirst, I should consider the general idea that having children is a big financial commitment. Childcare, education, healthcare, basic needs\u2014all these add up. The author's stance is that they want to be able to support the child, which seems reasonable. But their parents and friends are dismissing the importance of money. Maybe they think that love and care are more important than financial stability. However, the author is not saying money is the only factor, just that it's a crucial one. \n\nI should check if the author is being selfish or overly focused on money. The argument is about planning and financial stability to avoid long-term issues. The author's intention is to provide a better life for the child, which is a common concern. On the other hand, maybe the parents and friends are coming from a place where they believe people can manage without a lot of money, using resources or community support. But in reality, financial stability does play a role in the child's well-being and the parents' ability to meet their needs. \n\nThe key here is that the author is not denying that other factors matter, like love and support, but is emphasizing the financial aspect. Their girlfriend also agrees, so it's a mutual decision. The friends and parents might not be considering the practicalities, but the author's concern is valid. So, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong because it's reasonable to consider financial stability when planning a child.\n"
