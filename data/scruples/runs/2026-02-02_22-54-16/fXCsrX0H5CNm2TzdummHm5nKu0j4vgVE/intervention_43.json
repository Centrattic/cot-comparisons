I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether money matters when deciding to have a child. The author's parents and friends say money isn't important, but the author disagrees, thinking financial stability is necessary to provide for the child. The friends and family are pushing back against the idea that money is a factor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the general societal views on this. It's a common debate. On one hand, people might say love and care are what matter most for a child, not money. On the other hand, financial stability can reduce stress, provide better healthcare, education, and opportunities. So the author is arguing that without financial stability, there can be long-term issues for the child. \n\nThe friends and parents are saying money isn't a merit factor. The author is countering that with practical concerns. The question is whether the author is wrong for thinking financial stability is important. \n\nI need to recall if there's any research or common consensus. Studies do show that financial stress can affect parenting and child outcomes. Lack of resources can limit a child's access to necessities. So the author's point isn't without merit. \n\nBut some might argue that with enough love and effort, you can still raise a child well even with less money. However, the author is not saying money is the only factor, just that it's a significant one. They want to plan financially before having a child. \n\nSo the friends and family might be in denial about the practical challenges. The author is being realistic. The question is whether being realistic makes them an asshole. Probably not. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They're making a valid point about the importance of financial stability.\n"
