I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking that money is important when deciding to have a child. The author's parents and friends argue that money has no merit in this decision, but the author disagrees, wanting to be financially stable first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common societal views on this. It's widely accepted that financial stability is a crucial factor when planning for a family. Kids have basic needs like food, housing, education, healthcare, etc., which all cost money. Being financially prepared can help reduce stress and provide better opportunities for the child.\n\nThe author's stance is practical. They want to ensure they can support a child financially, which seems responsible. Their girlfriend agrees, so they're on the same page. The friends and parents might be emphasizing other aspects like love, commitment, or emotional readiness, which are important too. But saying money has nothing to do with it seems dismissive of the practical realities.\n\nHowever, is it possible that the author is overemphasizing money? Maybe. But the question is whether they are wrong for thinking money matters. The key here is whether the author's opinion is invalid. Since financial stability is a legitimate concern, the author isn't wrong for considering it. The friends and parents might not be wrong either, but the author's position is valid.\n\nSo the answer should be B, No. The author is not in the wrong for valuing financial stability when planning to have a child.\n"
