I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is the asshole here. The situation is about whether money matters when deciding to have a child. The author's parents and friends say money doesn't matter, but the author disagrees, saying they want to be financially stable first. They also mention the high costs of living and potential issues from not being able to support a child financially. The question is if the author is wrong for thinking that money is important.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common perspectives on this. Financial stability is often cited as a key factor in raising a child. It's about being able to provide basic needs, education, healthcare, etc. On the other hand, some people might argue that love and emotional support are more important than money. But the author is specifically talking about financial stability to avoid long-term issues for the child.\n\nThe friends and parents dismissing money's role might be oversimplifying. While it's true that you don't need a lot of money to raise a child, having enough to meet their needs is crucial. The author is planning to wait until they're stable, which is a responsible approach. The friends and parents might not be considering the practical aspects. The author's point about high costs and potential problems if you can't support is valid. So, the author isn't wrong for valuing financial stability. They're making a reasonable argument based on practical concerns. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
