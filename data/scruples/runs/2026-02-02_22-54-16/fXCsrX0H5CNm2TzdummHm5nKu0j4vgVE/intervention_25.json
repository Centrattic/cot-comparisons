      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that money does matter when deciding to have a child. The situation is that the author's parents and friends say money shouldn't be a factor, but the author disagrees, wanting to be financially stable first. The author's girlfriend also agrees.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments on both sides. The friends and family might believe that love, emotional readiness, and other factors are more important than financial stability. They could argue that it's possible to raise a child without much money, or that financial stress can be managed. On the other hand, the author's stance is practical: financial stability can prevent long-term issues for the child and the parents. They're planning to ensure they can provide for the child's needs, which is a responsible approach.\n\nI should think about societal norms. In many cultures, financial readiness is considered a key part of being ready for parenthood. The cost of raising a child is significant, including healthcare, education, and basic living expenses. Without financial stability, parents might face stress that affects the child's well-being. So the author's position is reasonable from a practical standpoint.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that financial stability isn't the only factor. Emotional support, parental time, and a stable relationship are also crucial. But the author isn't dismissing other factors; they specifically mention wanting to plan once they're stable. The disagreement here is about the role of money, not other aspects of parenting.\n\nThe friends might be advocating a more idealistic view, thinking that love and commitment can overcome financial challenges. While that's possible, it's not universally true. The author is making a pragmatic choice, which is valid. There's no right or wrong answer here, but rather different perspectives.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it depends on the context. The author isn't causing harm by planning to be financially stable. They're not dismissing other factors, just emphasizing the importance of financial aspects. Their girlfriend supports them, which adds another layer of validation. The friends' advice might be based on good intentions but could overlook the practical challenges. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a responsible decision based on realistic considerations. The answer should be B.\n"
