I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that money does matter when deciding to have a child. Their parents and friends say money isn't important, but the author and their girlfriend disagree. The author argues that financial stability is necessary to provide for a child and that not planning financially could cause long-term issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider different perspectives. On one hand, people might argue that while money is important, it's not the only factor. They might say that love, support, and other non-monetary aspects are more crucial. But the author is emphasizing financial stability to avoid problems, which seems reasonable. \n\nThen, looking at the practical side, studies and experts often mention that financial preparedness is a significant factor in a child's well-being. The cost of raising a child is substantial, so being financially stable can reduce stress and provide better opportunities. The author's concern is valid here.\n\nThe friends and family might be downplaying the role of money, perhaps thinking that it's overemphasized. But the author is making a rational decision based on practical considerations. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would depend on whether prioritizing financial stability is seen as a valid reason. Given that financial readiness is a common recommendation, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
