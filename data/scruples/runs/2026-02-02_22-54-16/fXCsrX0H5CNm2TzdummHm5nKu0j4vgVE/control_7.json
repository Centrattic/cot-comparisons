      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for believing that money does matter when deciding to have a child. The scenario is that the author and their girlfriend, who are in their early 20s (M23 and F22), want to wait until they're financially stable. Their parents and friends are telling them that money isn't a factor, but the author disagrees.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author wrong for thinking that financial stability is important? The options are A (Yes, they're wrong) or B (No, they're not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider common viewpoints on this topic. There's a lot of debate about the role of financial status in raising children. Some people argue that love and emotional support are more important than money, while others believe that financial instability can lead to stress and negatively impact a child's well-being. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that financial instability can cause long-term issues for the child. They mention the high costs of living and raising a child. This seems logical because children need basic necessities like food, shelter, education, and healthcare, all of which require money. If a parent is struggling financially, it could lead to stress in the household, potentially affecting the child's development. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that financial struggles can be overcome with creativity, support networks, or government assistance. However, the author's stance is that planning for financial stability is responsible. The girlfriend agrees, so they're making a joint decision based on their goals. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, while some people may have different opinions, the idea that financial preparedness is important isn't inherently wrong. The author is making a responsible choice based on their assessment of what's best for a child. Therefore, it's more likely that the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
