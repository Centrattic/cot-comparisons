      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author (AITA) is being told by their parents and friends that money isn't a factor when deciding to have a child. The author disagrees, saying they want to be financially stable first and that their girlfriend agrees. They argue that not having enough money can cause long-term issues for the child. The main question is whether the author is the asshole for thinking money matters.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common perspective on this. A lot of people do believe that financial stability is crucial for raising a child. There's a lot of evidence that financial stress can affect parenting and a child's well-being. So the author's stance seems reasonable. But the friends and family are saying money isn't important. Maybe they're emphasizing other factors like love, time, or emotional support. However, the author is making a practical argument based on real-world costs (like living expenses, healthcare, education). \n\nI should also think about the structure of an AITA post. Usually, people are in the right if they're standing up for their own reasonable beliefs, especially when they're planning for the child's future. The author is not dismissing other factors but pointing out the importance of financial stability. The friends and family's advice might be idealistic, but the author is practical. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong. They're making a valid point about ensuring they can provide for the child, which is a responsible approach.\n"
