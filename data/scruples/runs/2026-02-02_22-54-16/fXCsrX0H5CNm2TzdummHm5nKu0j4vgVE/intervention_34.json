I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for disagreeing with others who say money doesn't matter when having a child. The author's parents and friends argue that money isn't a factor, but the author and their girlfriend think financial stability is important. They mention the high costs of raising a child and potential long-term issues if you can't support them financially.\n\nFirst, I need to consider general societal views on this. Most people would agree that financial stability is a significant factor in raising a child. There's a lot of data showing that economic hardships can impact a child's well-being, education, healthcare access, etc. So, the author's stance seems reasonable. \n\nThen, the friends and family's perspective: they might be emphasizing emotional readiness, love, and other non-monetary aspects. It's possible they're idealistic or have different experiences. But even then, ignoring financial aspects entirely could be shortsighted. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's argument is valid. Since both sides have points, but the author isn't dismissing the other perspectives entirely\u2014they just disagree\u2014it's more of a difference in opinion. The author is planning to be financially stable, which is a common-sense approach. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They're making a practical decision based on real-world factors, and it's their right to prioritize that. Disagreeing with others doesn't make them the asshole here.\n"
