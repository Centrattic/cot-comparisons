      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is the asshole for thinking that money does matter when having kids. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author is arguing against their parents and friends who say money isn't important. The author's main point is that financial stability is crucial for a child's well-being. They mention wanting to plan for a kid once they're stable, and that not having enough money can cause long-term issues. Their girlfriend agrees with them.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate whether financial considerations are valid in the context of having children. From what I know, child-rearing costs can be substantial. There's the cost of living, healthcare, education, and unexpected expenses. Being financially stable can help ensure a child's basic needs are met, which seems logical. \n\nThen there's the counterpoint: some people might argue that love and care are more important than money. But the author isn't saying money is the only factor; they're emphasizing that financial stability is a necessary part of planning. They're not dismissing other factors, just pointing out that money plays a significant role.\n\nThe parents and friends' stance is that money doesn't matter, which could be idealistic. But in reality, financial stress can impact a family's dynamics and a child's environment. The author's concern is about providing for the child, which is a responsible perspective.\n\nSo, considering common advice, many experts recommend financial preparedness before having kids. The author isn't wrong for valuing financial stability alongside emotional readiness. Their argument is practical and realistic. Therefore, the answer should be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
