I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for disagreeing with the idea that money has nothing to do with having a child. The author's parents and friends say money doesn't matter, but the author and their girlfriend think financial stability is important.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common arguments on both sides. The author's position is practical\u2014they want to plan for a child when they can afford it. They mention the high costs of living and potential long-term issues if finances aren't stable. Their girlfriend agrees, which is a good sign. \n\nOn the other hand, the friends and parents argue that money isn't important. That's a common stance in some circles, emphasizing love, emotional readiness, or other factors. But logically, financial stability does impact a child's well-being. Children need basic necessities like food, healthcare, education, which all cost money. Being financially unprepared can lead to stress, which affects parenting and the child's environment.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for valuing financial planning. The statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" seems like an overgeneralization. While money isn't the only factor, it's definitely a significant one. The author isn't dismissing other aspects, just pointing out the importance of financial readiness.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is sound. They're not the asshole here. The answer should be B.\n"
