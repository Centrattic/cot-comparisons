I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when they disagreed with their parents and friends who said money doesn't matter when having a child. The author and their girlfriend think financial stability is important. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments on both sides. The parents and friends claim money isn't a factor, while the author insists it's crucial. The author is planning to wait until they're financially stable. \n\nFinancial stability is a common concern when considering having children. Expenses like healthcare, education, and basic needs can be significant. If a parent can't provide adequately, it might affect the child's well-being. So, the author's stance seems reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, people might argue that love and emotional support are more important than money. However, the author isn't dismissing love; they're emphasizing financial planning to support the child properly. Their friends and parents might not realize the practical challenges involved.\n\nThe author's agreement with their girlfriend reinforces their decision. They're both aware of the costs and want to avoid long-term issues. This proactive approach is responsible. \n\nConsidering societal norms, many people do consider financial readiness when planning a family. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing this. Their friends and parents might be idealistic, but the author's practical reasoning holds weight. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong for valuing financial stability in raising a child.\n"
