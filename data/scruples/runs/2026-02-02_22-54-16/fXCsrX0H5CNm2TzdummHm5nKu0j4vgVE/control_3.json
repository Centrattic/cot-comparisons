      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that money does matter when deciding to have a child. The author's parents and friends argue that money isn't a factor, but the author and their girlfriend believe financial stability is important to properly support a child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common perspectives on this topic. Many people do emphasize the importance of financial stability when planning a family. There's a lot of advice out there suggesting that being unable to support a child financially can lead to stress, poor living conditions, and long-term issues for the child. On the other hand, some argue that love and emotional support are more critical, and that financial struggles can be managed with other resources like community support or government assistance.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that not having enough money can cause problems. They also mention discussing the high costs of living and potential long-term issues. Their girlfriend agrees with them, which suggests they've thought about it together. The friends and parents seem to dismiss financial considerations entirely, which the author finds problematic.\n\nNow, is the author wrong for thinking money matters? Well, it's a common viewpoint. There's no right or wrong answer here, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding that belief. Since the author is just expressing a valid concern that many people share, it's unlikely they're the asshole. The friends and parents might be idealistic, but the author isn't wrong for prioritizing financial stability. So the answer should be B.\n"
