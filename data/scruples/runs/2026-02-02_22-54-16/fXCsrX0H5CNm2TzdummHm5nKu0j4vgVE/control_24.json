      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for disagreeing with the idea that money isn't important when having a child.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is M23, their girlfriend is F22. They both want to wait until they're financially stable before having a kid. Their parents and friends say money doesn't matter for deciding to have a child. The author argues that it's important to be able to support the child financially. \n\nNow, the main point of contention is whether money plays a role in being able to properly raise a child. The author believes it's crucial to be financially stable to avoid long-term issues for the child. The others think money isn't a factor. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, some people might say that love and care are more important than money. They could argue that financial stability isn't the sole determinant of a child's well-being. However, there's a lot of evidence and common advice that financial stability helps provide for a child's needs, reduces stress, and creates a better environment. \n\nThe author isn't saying money is everything, but that it's a necessary factor. They're planning, which is responsible. Their friends and family might be dismissing the practical aspects of child-rearing. \n\nI should also think about societal norms. Many experts and resources advise considering financial readiness before having a child. So, the author's stance aligns with that advice. Their disagreement isn't unreasonable. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It seems like they're making a practical argument. Their friends and family might be idealistic, but the author isn't wrong for wanting to be prepared. So, the answer is B, No.\n"
