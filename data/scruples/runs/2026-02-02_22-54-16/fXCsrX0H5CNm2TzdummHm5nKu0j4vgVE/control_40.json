      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is the asshole (AITA) for thinking that money does matter when deciding to have a child. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's parents and friends are saying that money isn't important when having a kid. The author disagrees, arguing that financial stability is crucial to provide for the child. They mention the high costs of living and potential long-term issues if a family can't support a child financially. The question is whether the author is wrong in this belief.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, people often say that money isn't everything in parenting, and they emphasize love and care. But the author is pointing out the practical aspect\u2014kids are expensive. Medical bills, education, basic needs all cost money. There's research showing that financial stress can impact family dynamics and child development. So the author isn't wrong to think that financial stability is a factor.\n\nThe other side might say that it's possible to raise a child without much money, relying on community support, government aid, or other resources. However, the author's point is about planning and stability, not just having money. They want to be in a position where they can provide adequately, which is responsible. \n\nThe friends and parents might be idealistic, thinking that love is enough, but the author is being realistic about the practical challenges. It's not about money being the only factor, but one important part of readiness. So the author isn't in the wrong here. Their stance is reasonable and responsible.\n"
