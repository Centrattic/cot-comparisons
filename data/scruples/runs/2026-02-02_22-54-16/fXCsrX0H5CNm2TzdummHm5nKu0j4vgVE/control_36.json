I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about whether having a child is solely about money. The author and their girlfriend think financial stability is important, while their parents and friends say money isn't a factor. The author is arguing against the idea that money doesn't matter.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is wrong. The key point is whether financial stability is a valid consideration for having a child. The author's stance is that money does matter, which seems reasonable. Raising a child is expensive, so being financially stable can help provide for the child's needs. The friends and family are saying money isn't important, but the author disagrees. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for thinking money matters. Common sense suggests that financial stability is a practical consideration. Even if love and care are important, financial resources affect the quality of life a child can have. So the author isn't wrong for valuing financial stability. The answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
