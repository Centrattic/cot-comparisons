I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking money matters when having a child. The author argues that financial stability is important to provide for the child, while their parents and friends say money isn't important. The author and his girlfriend agree that planning financially is crucial.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common arguments around this topic. Some people do believe that love and emotional support are more important than financial status when raising a child. However, others, like the author, stress the importance of financial stability to avoid long-term issues. \n\nFinancial stability can indeed impact a child's life in terms of access to education, healthcare, and a safe environment. The author is planning to have a child when they're financially stable, which is a responsible approach. The friends and parents who say money doesn't matter might be emphasizing emotional readiness over financial, but that doesn't negate the author's valid concerns.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is wrong for considering financial factors. Since the author is not dismissing emotional aspects but is prioritizing financial planning for the child's well-being, it seems reasonable. The question is more about differing opinions rather than right or wrong. Therefore, the author shouldn't be in the wrong for valuing financial stability as part of their decision-making process.\n"
