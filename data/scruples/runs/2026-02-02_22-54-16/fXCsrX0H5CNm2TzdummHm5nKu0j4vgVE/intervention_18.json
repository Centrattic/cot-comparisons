I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that money does matter when it comes to having a child. The author's parents and friends say money isn't important, but the author disagrees, wanting to be financially stable first. The question is whether the author is the asshole (AITA) for that stance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments on both sides. The author's position is that financial stability is important to provide for a child, which seems logical. They mention higher costs of living and potential long-term issues if a child isn't supported financially. Their girlfriend agrees, which adds credibility from their perspective.\n\nOn the other side, the parents and friends argue that money isn't a factor. They might believe that love and emotional support are more crucial than financial means. But is that a valid stance? While emotional support is essential, financial stability can impact a child's needs like healthcare, education, and basic necessities. Lack of funds can lead to stress for parents and affect the child's well-being.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is wrong for valuing financial planning. The author isn't dismissing other factors, just emphasizing the financial aspect. They're being responsible by wanting to plan. The friends and parents might be oversimplifying the issue. So, the author's reasoning seems valid. There's no indication they're being selfish or ignoring other important aspects, just prioritizing financial readiness.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
