I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's parents and friends argue that money isn't a factor in deciding to have a child. The author counters by saying financial stability is important to provide for the child. The girlfriend agrees. They discussed the increasing costs of living and how financial instability can cause long-term issues for the child.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for thinking money does matter. The user thinks the author is right, but wants confirmation.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, people can have kids without a lot of money, and love/family support can be crucial. But on the other hand, financial stability does impact a child's well-being\u2014access to healthcare, education, basic needs. The author is planning to wait until they're stable, which is a responsible approach. Their friends and parents might be dismissing practical concerns, which the author is validly addressing.\n\nSo, the author is not wrong for valuing financial readiness. It's a reasonable stance. The answer should be B.\n"
