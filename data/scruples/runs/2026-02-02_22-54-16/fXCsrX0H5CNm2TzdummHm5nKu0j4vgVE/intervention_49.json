I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong when they disagree with the idea that money doesn't matter when having kids.\n\nSo the author is arguing that financial stability is important for raising a child, while their parents and friends say money isn't a factor. The author and their girlfriend want to plan for a child once they're financially stable. They also mention that financial instability can cause long-term issues for the child.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about financial responsibility and the role of money in raising a child. The friends and family are saying money isn't important, but the author disagrees. The author's position seems logical because providing for a child's needs\u2014like food, healthcare, education\u2014requires resources. If you're financially unstable, it could lead to stress, which might affect the child's well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a perspective that non-financial factors are more important, like love and support. But the original question is about whether the author is wrong for thinking money matters. The author isn't saying money is the only factor, just that it's a significant one. Their friends and family are dismissing the financial aspect entirely, which the author is challenging.\n\nI think the author is right to consider financial stability. Being responsible and planning for the future is a good approach. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
