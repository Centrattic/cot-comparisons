I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that money matters when deciding to have a child, given that their parents and friends say money isn't a factor. The author and their girlfriend (who are in their mid-20s) argue that financial stability is important to provide for a child, citing living costs and potential long-term issues if they can't support the child.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's stance is unreasonable. The key here is whether financial stability is a valid consideration in having a child. Common arguments against having children in financial instability include the ability to provide basic needs, education, healthcare, and a stable environment. These are legitimate concerns, and many experts and resources do advise considering financial readiness before having a child.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that love, support, and emotional readiness are more important than money. However, the author is not dismissing other factors, just emphasizing financial stability. The friends and family are saying money has \"no merit,\" which the author thinks is an overgeneralization. The author's position seems reasonable because they are planning to wait until they can provide adequately, which aligns with many real-life advice and societal norms.\n\nI need to check if there's any cultural or situational context that could flip this. For example, in some cultures or situations, people might prioritize other aspects. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong in this specific scenario. Since the author is expressing a valid concern and isn't dismissing other factors entirely, their stance isn't wrong. The friends' assertion that money has \"nothing to do with it\" is an absolute statement, which the author correctly challenges as being unrealistic. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
