      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is wrong for thinking that money does matter when having a child. The parents and friends say money isn't important, but the author and their girlfriend disagree. They want to be financially stable before having a kid because they believe it's important for supporting the child. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common arguments around this topic. There's a known debate about whether financial stability is necessary for raising a child. On one hand, some people argue that love and care are more important than money, and that you can't plan for every financial situation. On the other hand, others, like the author, believe that financial instability can lead to stress, affect the child's upbringing, and cause long-term issues. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they want to ensure they can provide for the child's needs, which is a valid concern. They also mention that their girlfriend agrees, which shows they're both on the same page. The friends and parents dismissing financial considerations might be coming from a place where they think that having a child is a personal choice beyond financial matters. But that doesn't account for the practical aspects. \n\nI should also think about societal factors. There's often a stigma against people who prioritize financial stability, with some viewing it as selfish or materialistic. However, it's important to recognize that financial instability can lead to real challenges in child-rearing, like inability to afford healthcare, education, or even basic needs. \n\nThe author isn't saying money is everything, but that it does play a significant role. They're making a responsible decision to plan, which is a common approach. The friends and parents might not be considering the long-term impacts. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a rational choice based on practical concerns. The answer should be B.\n"
