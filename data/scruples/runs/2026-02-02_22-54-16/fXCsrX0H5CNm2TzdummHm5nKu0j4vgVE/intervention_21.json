I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

Their parents and friends say money isn't important, but the author and their girlfriend think financial stability is crucial.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's stance is wrong. The key point is whether financial stability is a valid consideration for having a child. The author argues that not having enough money can lead to long-term issues for the child. That seems reasonable. Children do need basic necessities, education, healthcare, etc., which all cost money. So the author's concern isn't unfounded. \n\nOn the other hand, their friends and parents might be emphasizing that love and care are more important than money. While that's true, it's also a spectrum. Being financially stable can reduce stress and allow parents to provide a better environment. The author isn't saying money is the only factor, just that it's important. \n\nI think the author is justified in their position. They're planning responsibly, which is a common-sense approach. Their friends might be downplaying the financial aspects, but the author isn't wrong to consider them. So the answer should be B.\n"
