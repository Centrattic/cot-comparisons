I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong when they disagree with the idea that money doesn't matter when having a child. The author argues that financial stability is important to provide for the child and that being unprepared can cause problems. Their parents and friends say money isn't a factor, but the author and their girlfriend disagree.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's stance is valid. The author is emphasizing financial preparedness, which is a common concern when planning for a child. Raising a child involves significant expenses like healthcare, education, housing, etc. Not having enough money can lead to stress and affect the child's well-being. The author isn't saying money is the only factor, but that it's important. Their friends and parents might be focusing on other aspects like love and support, which are also crucial. However, the author's argument isn't invalid. Financial stability can contribute to a better environment for the child. There's no right or wrong here in terms of being an \"asshole\"; it's more about differing priorities. The author is stating a valid perspective, so they aren't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
