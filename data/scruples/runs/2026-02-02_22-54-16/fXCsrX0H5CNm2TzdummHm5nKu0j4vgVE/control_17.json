I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for disagreeing with their parents and friends who say money isn't important when deciding to have a kid. The author argues that financial stability is crucial for providing for a child, which seems reasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common viewpoints on this issue. Some people might believe that love and commitment are enough, while others prioritize financial security. The author's concern is about supporting the child's needs, which is a valid point. There's a lot of evidence showing that financial stress can impact family life and child development. So the author's stance isn't without merit.\n\nThe friends and parents might be emphasizing emotional readiness over financial factors, but the author is making a practical argument. The question is whether the author's disagreement makes them an asshole. Since they're expressing a valid concern and their partner agrees, it's more about differing priorities rather than being wrong. The answer should reflect that the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
