      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking that money does matter when deciding to have a kid. The situation is that the author and their girlfriend are 23 and 22, and they're planning to have a child once they're financially stable. Their parents and friends say that money isn't a factor, but the author disagrees. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the arguments. The author is arguing that financial stability is important for providing for a child, which makes sense. Kids are expensive, and being financially ready can help avoid long-term issues. The friends and parents are saying money isn't a factor, which could be idealistic or maybe they believe that love and support are more important than money. \n\nBut is the author wrong to think financial stability matters? Well, from a practical standpoint, there's a lot of evidence that financial stress can impact parenting and a child's well-being. Not having enough money can lead to stress, which can affect the family dynamic. Also, the costs of raising a child\u2014like medical care, education, food, and housing\u2014are real. So the author's concern isn't unfounded.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friends and parents are coming from a place of wanting the couple to not let fear of financial instability prevent them from having a family. They might think that with proper support systems, even if money is tight, they can manage. There's also the argument that waiting too long to have children can have its own issues, like age-related risks for the mother.\n\nBut the author isn't saying they'll never have kids if they can't afford it. They're saying they want to plan once they're stable. The friends and parents are dismissing the financial aspect entirely, which the author finds problematic. The key here is whether the author's stance is reasonable. Since financial preparedness is a common recommendation from experts in family planning, the author's position seems valid. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
