I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that money does matter when deciding to have a child. The author's parents and friends say money isn't a factor, but the author and their girlfriend disagree. They argue that financial stability is important to provide for the child and avoid long-term issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common perspectives on this. Some people believe that love and emotional support are more critical than financial resources, while others stress the importance of financial stability for a child's well-being. There's research indicating that financial stress can affect parenting and child development, but it's not the only factor.\n\nThe author's stance is that they want to be financially stable before having a child. That seems reasonable because being able to afford basic needs, healthcare, education, etc., is important. Their friends and family dismissing money as irrelevant might be oversimplifying the issue. The author is not saying money is everything, just that it's a significant factor. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, prioritizing financial stability to ensure a child's well-being isn't inherently wrong. It shows responsibility and planning. The friends and parents might be advocating for a more idealistic view, but the author's position is practical. There's no clear right or wrong here, but given that the author is considering future stability and the girlfriend agrees, it seems like a responsible approach. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
