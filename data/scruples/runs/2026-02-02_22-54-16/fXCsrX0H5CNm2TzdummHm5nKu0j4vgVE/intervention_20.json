I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong when they argue that money does matter in deciding to have a child. Their parents and friends say that money isn't important, but the author and their girlfriend think financial stability is crucial. The user wants to know if the author is the asshole (AITA) for disagreeing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue. The author is being told by others that money isn't a factor in having kids, but they believe financial stability is necessary to support a child. The friends and family are saying money \"has no merit\" in the decision, and the author is pushing back. The question is whether the author is wrong for their stance.\n\nI know that having a child is a huge responsibility, and financial stability is often cited as a key factor. There's a lot of research and advice out there emphasizing that children benefit from being in a stable environment, both financially and emotionally. On the other hand, some people argue that love and care are what matter most, and that financial issues can be managed as they arise. But the author and their girlfriend are planning to wait until they're financially stable to have a child, which seems reasonable.\n\nThe friends and parents might be making a point that money isn't the only factor, which is true. But the author is countering that money does play a significant role in ensuring the child's well-being. It's a common debate. The key here is whether the author's argument is valid. Since financial stability can affect a child's access to healthcare, education, and overall quality of life, it's a valid concern. The author isn't saying money is the only factor, but that it's important. The friends might be dismissing a legitimate point. So, the author isn't in the wrong for standing by their belief that financial stability is important. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
