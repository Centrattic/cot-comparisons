I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking that money does matter when deciding to have a child. The author's parents and friends argue that money isn't a factor, but the author and their girlfriend disagree, emphasizing financial stability to support a child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common advice around having children. Many experts and resources do stress the importance of financial readiness. For example, the cost of raising a child includes healthcare, education, housing, and daily needs. If a family isn't financially stable, it can lead to stress and affect the child's well-being. The author is planning to wait until they're stable, which seems responsible.\n\nOn the other hand, some people might argue that love and emotional support are more important than money. But the author isn't dismissing other factors; they're specifically pointing out financial stability as a necessary component. The key here is whether the author's stance is unreasonable. Since the argument is about prioritizing financial planning, and given that financial stress can impact parenting, the author's position seems valid. The friends and parents might be oversimplifying by saying money doesn't matter at all. The author is not in the wrong here.\n"
