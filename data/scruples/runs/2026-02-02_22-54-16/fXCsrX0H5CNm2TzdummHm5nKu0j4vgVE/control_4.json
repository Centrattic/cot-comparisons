      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking money does matter when having a kid. The parents and friends say money isn't important, but the author and their girlfriend argue that financial stability is crucial to avoid long-term issues for the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common advice around having children. Most resources I've seen emphasize the importance of financial readiness. Kids need basic things like food, healthcare, education, and a safe environment. Without enough money, parents might struggle to provide these, which could affect the child's well-being. So, the author's stance seems reasonable here.\n\nThen there's the aspect of planning. The author wants to wait until they're financially stable. That's a responsible approach. People often advise planning for children's future, including financial aspects. The girlfriend agreeing with the author also supports that they're both on the same page, which is a good sign.\n\nThe friends and parents might be coming from a place of thinking that love and emotional support are enough. While those are important, they don't replace the need for financial resources. There's a balance between emotional and financial preparedness. The author isn't dismissing the emotional aspect but is highlighting the practical side.\n\nThere's also the part about the costs of living. Raising a child is expensive. According to various sources, the cost can be in the hundreds of thousands over a lifetime. Without proper financial planning, parents could face stress, which can impact the child's development. The author pointing out the link between financial stability and child-rearing is valid.\n\nI should check if there's any cultural or contextual factors I'm missing. The user mentions \"M23\" and \"F22,\" which I assume are their ages. At 23 and 22, they might be young, but wanting to plan financially is a mature decision. It's not about being too young but about readiness.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is the asshole, they're standing by a logical argument supported by practical considerations. The friends and parents might not be considering the long-term financial implications as much. The author isn't dismissing the importance of love but is emphasizing the necessity of financial stability, which is a common-sense approach.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. Their reasoning is sound, and they're making a responsible decision. The answer should be B.\n"
