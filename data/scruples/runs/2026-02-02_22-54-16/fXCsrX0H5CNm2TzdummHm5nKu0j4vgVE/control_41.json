I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether money matters when deciding to have a child. The author argues that financial stability is important, while their parents and friends say money isn't a factor. The author is upset because they and their girlfriend want to plan financially before having a kid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author is saying that money does matter, which their friends and family are dismissing. The user is asking if the author is wrong for thinking that. \n\nFinancial stability when having a child is a common concern. Studies and general advice often mention that financial readiness is crucial for a child's well-being. Parents need to provide for basic needs, healthcare, education, etc. So the author's stance seems reasonable. Their friends and parents might be making a point that love and care are more important, but that doesn't negate the practical aspects. \n\nThe author isn't saying money is everything, just that it's a significant factor. They're planning to be financially stable, which is responsible. The friends' argument that money has no merit in deciding to have a kid might be oversimplifying. \n\nSo the author's perspective is valid. They're not wrong for thinking money matters. The answer should be B, No, they're not in the wrong.\n"
