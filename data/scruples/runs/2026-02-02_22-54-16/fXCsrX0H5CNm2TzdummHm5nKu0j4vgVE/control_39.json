I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for arguing that money is important when considering having a child. The author's parents and friends say money doesn't matter, but the author and their girlfriend believe financial stability is crucial. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the common arguments around this. Many people argue that while money is important, it's not the only factor. Love, support, and a safe environment are also vital. However, the author is specifically pointing out the financial costs of raising a child, which can be substantial\u2014education, healthcare, basic needs, etc. Without financial stability, these expenses can create stress and affect the child's well-being.\n\nThe author's stance isn't that money is everything, but that it's a significant factor. They're planning to wait until they're stable, which is a responsible approach. Their friends and family might be emphasizing emotional readiness over financial aspects, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong. It's more about differing priorities. \n\nThe question is whether the author is an asshole (the wrong) for disagreeing with the \"money doesn't matter\" statement. Since the author is advocating for financial planning, which is practical and responsible, it's hard to see them as wrong. Their argument is grounded in real-world concerns about the child's future. \n\nSo the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
