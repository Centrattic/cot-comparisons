I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about whether having a child is related to money. The author argues that financial stability is important for providing for a child, while others say money isn't a factor.\n\nI need to determine if the author is wrong. The key points are the author's stance on financial planning before having a child versus the others' dismissal of money's role. \n\nFinancial stability is commonly considered important for raising a child. Many experts and resources suggest that being able to afford childcare, education, healthcare, etc., is crucial. So the author's position seems reasonable.\n\nThe friends and parents might be emphasizing that love and care are more important than money. But the author is not denying the importance of non-financial aspects; they're just stressing the financial part. Arguing that money has no merit is a strong statement, and the author is pointing out the practical realities. \n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong for thinking that money does matter when deciding to have a child. Their reasoning is valid. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
