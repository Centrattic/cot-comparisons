      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that money does matter when considering having a child, while others claim it doesn't. The author's parents and friends say money isn't a factor, but the author and their girlfriend argue that financial stability is important to properly support a child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue here: the role of finances in deciding to have a child. The author is being called out for prioritizing financial stability, but is that actually wrong? Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, some people might argue that love and emotional readiness are more crucial than money. They might say that with proper planning and support systems, financial stability isn't the main factor. However, the author points out the high costs of raising a child, which can lead to long-term issues if not addressed. This is a valid concern because children's needs are significant, and financial strain can affect their well-being and the parents' ability to provide adequately.\n\nFinancial stability can reduce stress for the parents, ensure access to better education and healthcare for the child, and provide a more secure environment. Studies and real-life examples often highlight that economic hardship can impact a child's development. So, the author's stance isn't just about money but about creating a stable environment.\n\nOn the other hand, others might counter that focusing too much on money can prevent people from starting families when they're emotionally ready. But the author isn't dismissing emotional aspects; they're emphasizing the practical side. The key here is that the author isn't saying money is the only factor but that it's an important one.\n\nThe parents and friends might have their own perspectives based on their experiences, but that doesn't make the author wrong. It's about having a balanced view. The author is advocating for planning and responsibility, which are generally seen as positive traits. So, in this context, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a rational argument based on practical considerations, which is a reasonable approach.\n"
