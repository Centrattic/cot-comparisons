      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether money matters when deciding to have a child. The author's parents and friends say money doesn't matter, but the author and their girlfriend disagree, thinking financial stability is important. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue. The author is being told that money isn't a factor in having a child. They argue that it's important to be financially stable to provide for the child, avoid issues, etc. The question is if the author is wrong for disagreeing with the \"money has nothing to do with it\" statement.\n\nI know that in reality, financial stability is often cited as a key factor in raising a child. Kids are expensive, and being in a better financial position can reduce stress, provide better resources, and improve the child's opportunities. So the author's perspective seems reasonable.\n\nBut maybe the friends are emphasizing other aspects, like emotional readiness or love. However, the author is not denying the importance of those factors, just pointing out that money does matter. The friends' statement seems overly dismissive of financial considerations. \n\nThe author is also planning to wait until they're stable, which is a responsible approach. The friends and parents might be coming from a place where they think readiness is more about emotional factors, but financially stability is part of that readiness. \n\nI don't see any malicious intent here. The author is making a logical argument based on practical concerns. The friends and parents might not be considering all the financial implications. So the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the role of money in this decision. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
