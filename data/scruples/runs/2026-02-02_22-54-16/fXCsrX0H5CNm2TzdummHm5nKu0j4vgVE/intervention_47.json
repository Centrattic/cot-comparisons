I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is arguing that money does matter when deciding to have a child, while others say it doesn't. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's parents and friends say money isn't a factor. But the author and his girlfriend think financial stability is important to provide for a child. They mentioned the high costs of living and potential long-term issues if you can't support a kid. \n\nI need to consider if the author is wrong for thinking money matters. Well, from a practical standpoint, children do require resources. Basic needs like food, clothing, healthcare, education\u2014all cost money. Lack of financial stability can lead to stress for parents and affect the child's well-being. Studies show that financial strain can impact a child's development. So, the author has a valid point here.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that love and emotional support are more important than money. But that doesn't mean money isn't a factor. The author isn't saying love isn't important, just that financial stability helps in providing for the child's needs. It's a balance, but the author's stance is reasonable.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is wrong for valuing financial stability. Since both parents and friends are saying money doesn't matter, but the author is planning to be stable, it's about differing priorities. The author isn't dismissing emotional aspects but is focusing on practicality. So, the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
