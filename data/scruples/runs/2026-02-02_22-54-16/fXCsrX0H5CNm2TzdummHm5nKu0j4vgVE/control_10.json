I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for disagreeing with their parents and friends who say that money isn't a factor in having a child. The author argues that financial stability is important to provide for the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common arguments on both sides. The people around the author say money isn't the main factor, maybe emphasizing love, emotional readiness, or other non-financial aspects. The author and their girlfriend prioritize financial stability to avoid long-term issues for the child. \n\nI know that having a child is a major responsibility. Financial resources can affect a child's opportunities, access to education, healthcare, and overall well-being. It's reasonable for someone to want to be financially stable before having a child. However, some people might argue that love and support are more crucial than money. But the key here is whether the author is wrong for valuing financial stability.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The author isn't wrong for thinking that financial stability matters. Many experts do highlight financial preparedness as important for a child's development. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
