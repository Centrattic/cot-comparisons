      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for thinking that money does matter when deciding to have a child. Their friends and parents say money isn't important, but the author and their girlfriend want to be financially stable first. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The friends and parents might believe that love and other factors are more important than financial stability when raising a child. They might think that being emotionally ready or having a good relationship is enough. On the other hand, the author is emphasizing the financial aspect, pointing out that not having enough money can lead to long-term issues for the child.\n\nI know that having a child is a big responsibility, and financial stability can affect the quality of life for the child. For example, being able to afford healthcare, education, and a safe environment. However, some people might argue that financial stability can be achieved over time, and that other factors like emotional support and time spent with the child are more crucial. \n\nBut the author is not saying money is the only factor, just that it's an important one. They want to plan and be stable before having a child, which is a responsible approach. The friends and parents dismissing the financial aspect entirely might be oversimplifying the situation. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for valuing financial stability. They are making a practical decision that could benefit the child in the long run. It's reasonable to want to be in a good financial position before taking on such a big responsibility. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
