I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether money matters when deciding to have a child. The author's parents and friends say money doesn't matter, but the author disagrees, thinking financial stability is important. The author's girlfriend agrees with them.\n\nFirst, I should consider the main points of the argument. The author argues that having a child when you can't support them financially can lead to long-term issues. Their friends and family say money isn't a factor. The author is being told they're wrong for thinking money does matter. \n\nI need to evaluate if the author's stance is valid. Financial stability can indeed affect a child's upbringing\u2014like access to education, healthcare, and a safe environment. Studies show that economic hardship can impact a child's development. So, the author's concern isn't baseless. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that love and emotional support are more important than money. But the author isn't saying money is everything, just that financial stability helps avoid problems. Their friends' dismissal of money's role seems overly simplistic. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for holding this view. Since financial stability is a legitimate factor in child-rearing, the author isn't being unreasonable. Their friends might be ignoring practical aspects. So, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
