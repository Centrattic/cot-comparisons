      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for disagreeing with their parents and friends who say that money has nothing to do with having a child. The author and their girlfriend (who's 22) think financial stability is important to avoid long-term issues for the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The parents and friends say money isn't a factor. The author counters that financial stability is crucial for providing for the child's needs and preventing problems. The key here is whether financial stability is a valid consideration in deciding to have a child.\n\nFrom what I know, raising a child involves significant expenses\u2014basic needs like food, housing, healthcare, education. Without financial stability, these can become burdens. Studies also show that economic hardship can affect a child's well-being and development. So, the author's stance seems reasonable. They're aiming to plan for the child's future by ensuring they can support them financially.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents and friends might argue that love and commitment are more important than money. While that's true, it doesn't negate the practical aspects. Being financially stable doesn't mean having a lot of money, just being able to meet the child's needs without undue stress.\n\nThe author isn't dismissing the importance of love or non-material aspects; they're emphasizing the necessity of financial responsibility. Their argument is practical and based on wanting to avoid negative consequences. So, their position is valid. Therefore, the answer should be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
