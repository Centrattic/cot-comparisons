I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking that money does matter when deciding to have a child. The parents and friends are saying money doesn't matter, but the author and their girlfriend want to be financially stable first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author is arguing that financial stability is important to provide for a child. Their friends and family dismiss this, but the author thinks otherwise. The question is whether the author is right or wrong.\n\nFinancial stability is a common factor in family planning. Kids have various needs like healthcare, education, basic living expenses. If a family can't support these, it could lead to stress, which affects the child's well-being. Studies often show that poverty can impact children's development, so financial stability is a valid concern.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that love and support are more important than money. However, the author isn't saying money is everything, just that it's a necessary component. The friends' statement that money has \"no merit\" seems extreme because it ignores practical aspects of child-rearing.\n\nThe author's decision to plan for financial stability is responsible. It's about preparing to meet the child's needs, not about prioritizing money over love. The friends and parents might be idealizing the idea of raising a child regardless of financial state, but real-life challenges make financial preparedness important.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a realistic plan, which is a responsible approach. The answer should be B.\n"
