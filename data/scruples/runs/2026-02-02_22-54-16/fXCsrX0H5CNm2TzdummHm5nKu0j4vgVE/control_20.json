I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking that money does matter when having a child. The author's parents and friends say money doesn't matter, but the author disagrees and wants to be financially stable first. They also mention the high costs of living and potential issues if you can't support a child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common perspectives on this. Many people argue that while love and support are important, financial stability is crucial for a child's well-being. Financial instability can lead to stress for parents, which affects the child. There's also the practical aspect of providing for basic needs, education, healthcare, etc.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that emotional readiness and a supportive environment are more important than money. But the author's point is that money does play a role in providing those things. The author isn't saying money is everything, but that it's a factor. They also agree with their girlfriend on this, which shows mutual understanding.\n\nI should check if the author is being unreasonable. The statement they're challenging is \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid.\" The author is countering that by pointing out the financial costs involved. It's a reasonable argument. So, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're just emphasizing a practical aspect that others might downplay. The answer should be B (No).\n"
