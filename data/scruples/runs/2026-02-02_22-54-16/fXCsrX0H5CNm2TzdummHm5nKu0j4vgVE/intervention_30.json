I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when they disagree with the statement that money has nothing to do with having a child. The author's parents and friends say money isn't a factor, but the author and their girlfriend think financial stability is important for a child's well-being. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the core of the disagreement. The author is arguing that financial stability matters when planning a child, which makes sense because raising a child is expensive. They mention costs of living and potential long-term issues if a family can't support the child financially. Their friends and family are dismissing the role of money in this decision.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking money does matter. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user already thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nI should consider common arguments around this topic. Many people do believe that while money isn't the only factor, financial stability is important for a child's upbringing. There's research showing that economic hardship can affect a child's development, access to education, healthcare, etc. So the author's concern isn't baseless.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that love and emotional support are more critical than money. But the author isn't saying money is everything, just that it's a factor. They're planning to wait until they're stable. That seems reasonable. Their friends' stance that money has \"nothing to do with it\" seems extreme because it ignores practical realities.\n\nSo, the author is making a logical point based on real-world financial challenges. Their friends and family might be idealistic, but the author isn't wrong for considering financial aspects. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
