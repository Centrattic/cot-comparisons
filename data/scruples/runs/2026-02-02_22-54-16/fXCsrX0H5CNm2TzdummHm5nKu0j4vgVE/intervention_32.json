      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that money does matter when deciding to have a kid. The author's parents and friends are saying that money has no merit in this decision, but the author and their girlfriend disagree. They mention wanting to be financially stable before having a child, and they've discussed the costs involved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author's position is based on the idea that financial stability is important to provide for a child's needs and to avoid long-term issues. On the other hand, their friends and family argue that money isn't the main factor. \n\nI should think about the responsibilities of parenting. While love and emotional support are crucial, financial stability can affect the child's access to resources like healthcare, education, and a safe living environment. There's a lot of research and societal advice that emphasizes the importance of being prepared financially before having children. \n\nBut then again, some people might argue that with proper planning, community support, or resourcefulness, it's possible to raise a child without a lot of money. However, the author's point is about avoiding financial stress that could impact the child's well-being. It's a balance between different factors, but the question is whether the author is wrong to prioritize financial stability. \n\nI don't think the author is in the wrong. It's reasonable to want to be financially stable before having a child. The author's stance is practical and considers the child's future. Their friends and family might be downplaying the financial aspect, but that doesn't make the author's perspective incorrect. So the answer should be B.\n"
