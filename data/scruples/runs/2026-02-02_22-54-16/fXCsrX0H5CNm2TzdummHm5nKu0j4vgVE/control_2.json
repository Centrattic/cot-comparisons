I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking that money matters when having a child. The author's parents and friends say that money isn't important in deciding to have a kid. The author argues that financial stability is necessary to provide for the child and avoid long-term issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments on both sides. The friends and family say money isn't a factor, maybe emphasizing love, emotional readiness, or other aspects. The author and their girlfriend are concerned about financial stability to support the child properly. \n\nI should evaluate if financial stability is a valid reason. There's a common debate about this. Some people argue that while money isn't everything, it's a practical necessity to ensure the child's needs are met. Others might say that with enough love and effort, you can make it work even without much money. However, studies and common sense suggest that financial strain can impact a family's well-being and a child's upbringing. \n\nThe author isn't dismissing the importance of other factors, just emphasizing financial planning. They agree with their girlfriend on this. The friends' stance might be idealistic, but the author's approach is practical. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a reasonable perspective based on real-world considerations. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
