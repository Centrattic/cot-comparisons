I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for arguing that money does matter when considering having a child. The author's parents and friends are saying money isn't important in that decision. The author and their girlfriend disagree, thinking it's crucial to be financially stable first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The people suggesting money isn't important might be emphasizing emotional readiness, love, or other non-financial factors. That's a valid perspective because raising a child involves more than just money\u2014like time, patience, and support systems. But the author is pointing out the practical side: the high costs of living, education, healthcare, etc. They want to avoid financial strain that could affect the child's well-being.\n\nFinancial stability is often cited by experts as a key factor in a child's development. Studies show that economic hardship can impact a child's health and opportunities. But it's not the only factor. However, the author's stance isn't denying love or emotional aspects; they're just prioritizing practical readiness.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is wrong for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is wrong. The original statement is an absolute claim. The author argues that money does matter, which is a reasonable counterargument. The friends and parents might be oversimplifying, but the author isn't wrong for correcting that.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a logical argument based on practical considerations without dismissing the other factors entirely.\n"
