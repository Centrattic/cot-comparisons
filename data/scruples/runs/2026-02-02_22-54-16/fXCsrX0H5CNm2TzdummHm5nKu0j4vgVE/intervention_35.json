I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for disagreeing with the idea that money doesn't matter when having a child. The author and their girlfriend want to wait until they're financially stable to have a kid because they believe it's important to provide for the child. Their friends and family are saying money isn't a factor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments for and against. The side of the author is that financial stability is important for a child's well-being. Studies do show that financial stress can affect parenting and a child's development. The cost of raising a child is significant, so being prepared financially makes sense. On the other hand, some might argue that love and emotional support are more important than money. But the author isn't saying money is everything, just that it's a necessary part of planning.\n\nThe friends and family's stance that money has no merit might be idealistic but not practical. Everyone's situation is different. The author is making a responsible decision based on their circumstances. It's also good that they discussed it with their partner and are planning together. There's no judgment here about their personal choice; it's more about practical planning. So, the author isn't wrong for prioritizing financial stability. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
