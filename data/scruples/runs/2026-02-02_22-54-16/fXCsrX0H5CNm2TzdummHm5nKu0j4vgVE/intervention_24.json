I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking that money matters when deciding to have a child. The author's parents and friends say money isn't a factor, but the author and their girlfriend disagree. They argue that financial stability is important to provide for the child and that being unprepared financially can lead to long-term problems.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the general views on this topic. There are different opinions here. Some people believe that love and care are more important than financial status when raising a child. Others emphasize the importance of financial stability to ensure the child's well-being and access to resources like education, healthcare, and a safe environment. \n\nThe author's argument is that financial instability can cause lasting issues for the child. This is a common concern. Studies do show that financial stress can impact a child's development and family dynamics. However, there's also the counterpoint that many people manage to raise healthy, successful children without a lot of money. The key here is whether the author is wrong for valuing financial stability as a factor.\n\nThe user says they think the author isn't in the wrong, but they want confirmation. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering the arguments, the author is making a reasonable point based on practical concerns. The friends and parents might be prioritizing emotional aspects, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for considering financial factors. It's a personal decision and there's no single right answer. So the answer should be B.\n"
