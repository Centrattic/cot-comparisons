      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking money does matter when having a kid. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is M23, their girlfriend is F22. They both agree that they want to wait until they're financially stable to have a child. Their parents and friends are saying that money isn't important in deciding to have a kid. The author argues that it's false and that financial stability is necessary to provide for the child, which is more expensive. They mention the cost of living and potential long-term issues from not being able to support a child financially. The question is whether the author is an asshole for disagreeing with the \"money has nothing to do with it\" statement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common perspective on this. There's a debate about whether financial status is a necessary factor in having children. Some people argue that love and care are more important than money, while others, like the author, believe that financial stability is crucial to avoid hardships for the child.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that children need proper support, education, healthcare, etc., which all cost money. If a family can't afford these, it might lead to stress, lower quality of life for the child, or even neglect in extreme cases. Their parents and friends dismiss financial considerations, which the author disagrees with.\n\nIs the author wrong for holding this view? Well, there's a lot of evidence that financial stability does impact a child's well-being. Studies show that children in financially stable households tend to have better outcomes. So the author's concern is valid. However, some might argue that with proper planning and support, even lower-income families can raise healthy kids. But the author isn't saying money is everything\u2014just that it's a significant factor.\n\nIn terms of the question, the author is standing by their belief that money does matter, which is a reasonable stance. They're not dismissing love or care, just the financial aspect. Their friends and family are in the camp that money isn't a factor, which is a different opinion. The key here is whether the author is wrong for disagreeing. Since there's no right or wrong in opinion, but the author's reasoning is based on practical considerations, I don't think they're in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
