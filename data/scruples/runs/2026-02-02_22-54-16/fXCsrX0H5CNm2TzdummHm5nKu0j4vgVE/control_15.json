      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking that money does matter when deciding to have a kid. The parents and friends say money isn't a factor, but the author and their girlfriend think financial stability is important. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether financial stability is a valid consideration when planning to have a child. The author argues that being financially stable helps provide for the child and avoid long-term issues. Their friends and family are saying that money isn't the main factor. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, some people might argue that love, support, and emotional readiness are more important than money. They might say that you can't buy happiness or that parenting skills are more crucial. On the other hand, financial stability can impact a child's access to education, healthcare, and overall quality of life. Financial stress can also affect family dynamics and parental well-being, which in turn affects the child.\n\nThe author's perspective is that planning financially is responsible. They're not saying money is everything, but that it's a necessary part of being prepared. Their girlfriend agrees, which suggests mutual understanding. The friends and parents might be emphasizing other aspects, like the emotional or personal readiness. However, dismissing financial considerations entirely could be seen as naive, given the practical realities of raising a child.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while there's a common saying that \"money isn't everything,\" in practical terms, financial stability is often cited by experts as a component of child-rearing. High costs of childcare, education, and basic needs mean that financial planning is a realistic concern. The author isn't saying money is the only factor, just that it's a significant one. Their friends and parents might not be in agreement, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for valuing financial stability. Since financial security can contribute to a child's well-being, the author's stance is reasonable. The friends and parents might have a different viewpoint, but the author isn't being unreasonable. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
