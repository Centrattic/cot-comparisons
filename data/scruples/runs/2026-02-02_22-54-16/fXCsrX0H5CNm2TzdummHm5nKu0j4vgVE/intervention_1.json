I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for believing that money does matter when it comes to having a child. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is M23 and their girlfriend is F22. They're discussing having a child, and the author's parents and friends say money shouldn't be a factor. The author disagrees, thinking financial stability is important to provide for a child. The girlfriend agrees. They talk about the costs involved and how being unstable could harm the child. The author is asking if they're the asshole for thinking money does matter.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, people might say that love and care are more important than money, and that financial stability isn't the only factor. But on the other hand, having the financial means can significantly impact a child's well-being, access to necessities, education, healthcare, etc. Poverty can lead to stress and limit opportunities for a child.\n\nThe author is planning to wait until they're stable, which is a responsible approach. Their friends and family dismissing money's role might not be considering all the practical aspects. The author isn't saying money is everything, just that it's an important factor. So, the author's stance seems reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
