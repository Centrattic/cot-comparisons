We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for disagreeing with the idea that money doesn't matter when having a child. The author's parents and friends are saying money isn't important, but the author argues that financial stability is crucial for providing for a child and avoiding long-term issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common advice around having children. Many sources, including child development experts and financial advisors, often emphasize that financial stability is important. They talk about the costs of raising a child, from basic needs like food and healthcare to education and extracurricular activities. So the author's concern isn't baseless.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. People might argue that love and care are more important than money. But the author's point is about planning and responsibility. They want to ensure they can provide, which is a valid concern. Being financially stable can reduce stress and create a better environment for the child. \n\nI should also think about whether the author is wrong for holding this view. The friends and family's stance is that money doesn't matter, but the author's argument is practical. If someone were to have a child without financial means, it could lead to challenges that affect both the parents and the child. So the author is making a rational decision based on planning for the child's well-being.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a nuance here. Some people might have different priorities or resources. For example, if someone has a strong support system or a low-cost lifestyle, they might not need as much money. But the author's argument isn't about those scenarios; they're talking about not having financial stability at all. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's generally accepted that being prepared financially is a responsible step. So the author isn't wrong for valuing that. The friends and family might be idealizing the idea of parenthood without considering the practicalities. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They're making a responsible decision to plan financially before having a child, which is a common and reasonable approach.\n"
