      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband and wife where the wife expects her husband to clean the house while she's at work. She lists simple tasks and says it should take under an hour. The husband doesn't do them and gets snippy when she points out he only did part of the list.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife is setting clear expectations with a list. It's not unreasonable tasks. She even helps by setting up his coffee. The husband, on the other hand, isn't fulfilling his part and reacts poorly when reminded. \n\nIn relationships, shared responsibilities are common. If one person is taking on more, it's fair to expect the other to contribute. The wife's expectations seem reasonable. The husband's refusal without a valid reason and the snippiness when challenged could be his fault. \n\nBut maybe there's more to the story. Does the husband have valid reasons for not cleaning? The question doesn't mention any. The wife's tasks are simple and quick. The husband's reaction seems dismissive. \n\nSo, the author (the wife) is asking if she's in the wrong for expecting her husband to help. The answer likely hinges on whether the expectations are reasonable and mutual agreement. Since she's clear and the tasks are basic, it's not unreasonable. The husband's behavior seems to be the issue here rather than her expecting help. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
