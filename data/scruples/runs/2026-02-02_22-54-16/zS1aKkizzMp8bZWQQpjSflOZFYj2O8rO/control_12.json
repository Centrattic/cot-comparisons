      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work. She gives a list of simple tasks, mentions she sets up his coffee, and says he doesn't do them and gets snippy when she points it out.\n\nFirst, household responsibilities are a common topic in relationships. The key points here are expectations and communication. The author lists specific tasks that seem reasonable, taking less than an hour. She's not asking for something excessive. The husband isn't doing them and is getting snippy, which could indicate he's not on board with the arrangement.\n\nNow, the author isn't demanding perfection here. She's giving him a simple list and even helping him with the coffee. The husband's reaction is negative when she points out he didn't complete all tasks. This suggests a possible lack of mutual agreement on responsibilities.\n\nIn relationships, chores are often divided based on what both parties agree is fair. If the author expects her husband to do these tasks, but he's not willing, there might be a mismatch in expectations. However, the author isn't unreasonable here. She's clear about her needs and is asking for something minimal. The husband's resistance could be due to differing views on household duties or perhaps a lack of communication about roles.\n\nAnother angle is that the author might be taking on more than half the chores if she's doing them herself when he doesn't. But she's not saying she's doing all the housework, just that he's not meeting his end of the bargain. The question is whether she's wrong for expecting him to contribute in this way.\n\nThe husband getting snippy when she mentions he didn't do all the tasks shows a breakdown in communication. He might not be willing to discuss the division of labor, leading to resentment. The author's approach is to set clear expectations, which is reasonable. However, if there's no mutual agreement from the start, then the expectation might not be fair.\n\nBut the author isn't forcing him to do the tasks; she's expressing her needs. If the husband is unwilling to participate in the household chores, that's his issue. The author isn't wrong for wanting a clean home and setting boundaries. However, if the husband is not open to discussing or adjusting his behavior, that's where the problem lies.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. She has a reasonable expectation, and the issue stems from the husband's unwillingness to meet those expectations and his negative reactions. The key is that the author is not being unreasonable, so the answer would be B.\n"
