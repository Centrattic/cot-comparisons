      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for expecting their husband to clean the house while he's at home and they're at work. The author mentions they leave a simple list and set up the coffee pot, but the husband doesn't do the tasks and gets snippy when she points out he didn't complete them all.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author isn't asking for a lot\u2014just basic tasks like sweeping, dishes, making the bed, picking up clothes, and tidying the living room. These are reasonable household chores that many couples split. The husband is at home, so it's logical that he could handle these tasks while the author is away working. \n\nThe key points here are the expectations and communication. The author leaves a list, which suggests they're trying to be clear and helpful. Setting up the coffee pot is a nice gesture, showing they're considering his needs. The husband's response is getting snippy when he's only done part of the list. That might indicate he's resistant to the request or feels it's too much, but the author isn't demanding praise, just pointing out the incomplete tasks. \n\nIn relationships, sharing household responsibilities is common. The author's request seems fair and manageable. The husband's refusal or inability to do the tasks without getting annoyed could point to his unwillingness to contribute, which is a problem. The author isn't being unreasonable by expecting their partner to help maintain the home. \n\nHowever, maybe there's more to the story. Are there existing agreements about chores? Does the husband have a valid reason for not being able to clean, like a health issue or work stress? The post doesn't mention these factors, so I have to go by what's provided. \n\nSince the author isn't asking for exceptional effort and is offering support (coffee setup), their stance seems justified. The husband's snippiness when confronted about incomplete chores is more indicative of his issue rather than the author's wrongdoing. \n\nSo, the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. They have a reasonable expectation, and the husband's reaction is the problem here.\n"
