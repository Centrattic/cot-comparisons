      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband not doing the chores as expected.\n\nFirst, the author leaves a simple list of tasks. These are basic chores like sweeping, doing dishes, making the bed, etc. They mention that these tasks shouldn't take long and they even set up the coffee pot, which seems like a considerate gesture. The husband isn't doing them and gets snippy when she points out he didn't finish. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The author expects her husband to do some chores while she's at work. It's reasonable to split household responsibilities, especially if they're married. However, maybe the husband feels overburdened or there's an imbalance in their responsibilities. But the author says it's a simple list, so it's not excessive. \n\nThe husband's reaction is getting snippy, which might indicate resentment or that he's not happy with the arrangement. But the author isn't forcing him; she's asking for basic cleanliness. Maybe there's a communication issue here. However, since the author is the one asking if she's at fault, the focus is on her expectations. \n\nIn many relationships, sharing chores is expected. The author isn't demanding perfection, just basic tasks. The husband's refusal and negative attitude could be the issue here. The author isn't in the wrong for expecting her partner to help with household duties. So the answer is B.\n"
