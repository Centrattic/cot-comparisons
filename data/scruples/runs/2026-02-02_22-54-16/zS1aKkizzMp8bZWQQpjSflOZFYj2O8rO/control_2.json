      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about expecting the husband to clean the house while he's at home and the author is at work. The author leaves a simple list with basic tasks that should take less than an hour. The husband doesn't do them and gets snippy when she's not happy about it. The user wants a yes or no answer (A or B) on whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author is asking if it's too much to expect her husband to do some basic cleaning tasks while she's at work. The tasks listed are sweeping, dishes, making the bed, picking up clothes, tidying the living room. These are common household chores. She also sets up his coffee pot, which is a kind gesture. She mentions that he can't or won't do it and gets snippy when she's not happy with the incomplete tasks.\n\nNow, common advice in relationships often emphasizes teamwork and mutual respect. It's generally considered fair for both partners to share household responsibilities, especially if one is working. However, the fairness can depend on the specific circumstances and the balance of work between both partners. If the husband is also working, maybe the division of chores is a point of contention. But here, the author is asking if it's wrong for her to expect this.\n\nThe husband's reaction is important. Getting snippy when she's not happy suggests a lack of communication and possibly a lack of willingness to share responsibilities. The author is setting clear expectations with a list, which is reasonable. The fact that the tasks are simple and not time-consuming supports her stance. The husband's refusal to do them despite the clear expectations could indicate that he's not contributing equally, which is a common source of conflict in relationships.\n\nThe key points here are mutual expectations and communication. The author is not overburdening him; the tasks are minimal. The husband's negative reaction when he doesn't meet these expectations suggests he's not taking responsibility. In many cases, it's considered unfair if one partner takes on all the household chores while the other doesn't contribute, especially if they are both working. Therefore, the author might have a valid point in expecting her husband to help out.\n\nHowever, there could be other factors not mentioned, like the husband's workload, health, or if there's an existing agreement about chores that's different. But based solely on the information given, the author is asking for a simple, reasonable expectation. The husband's unwillingness and negative attitude are likely the main issues here. The author isn't in the wrong for expecting equal contribution, so the answer would be B (No).\n"
