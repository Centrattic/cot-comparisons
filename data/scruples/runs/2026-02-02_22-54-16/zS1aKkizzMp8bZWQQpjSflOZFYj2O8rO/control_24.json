      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author expects their husband to clean the house while they're at work and he's at home. They leave a simple list of tasks that should take less than an hour. The husband doesn't do them all and gets snippy when she points out he only did part of it. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common expectations in relationships regarding chores. It's pretty standard for couples to share household responsibilities. The author is setting clear, reasonable tasks. The husband is at home, so he has the opportunity to do the cleaning while she's away. The tasks are basic and not excessive. The author even mentions they set up the coffee pot for him, which shows they're trying to make things easier for him.\n\nThe husband not completing the tasks and reacting negatively when confronted might indicate he's not taking his share of the responsibilities. The author isn't asking for praise, just for the tasks to be done. The husband's snippiness could be due to resentment or not seeing the tasks as his responsibility. \n\nIn many relationships, both partners contribute, and expectations can vary. If the author isn't doing much else while the husband is handling the tasks, that could be an issue. But in this case, the author is at work, and the husband is at home, so it's logical he could handle the cleaning during the day. The tasks are simple and not time-consuming. \n\nThe key points here are the clarity of the expectations and the fairness of the workload. The author provides a list and sets up the coffee, showing they're making an effort. The husband's failure to complete the tasks and his negative reaction might suggest he's not fulfilling his part, which would make him the asshole. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. So the answer is B.\n"
