      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The question is about expecting the husband to clean the house while he's at home and the wife is at work.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The wife leaves a simple list with basic tasks: sweep floors, do dishes, make the bed, pick up dirty clothes, and tidy the living room. She mentions it's not much and should take under an hour. She also sets up his coffee, which seems like a kind gesture. The husband isn't doing these tasks and gets snippy when she's upset about incomplete work.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and shared responsibilities in a marriage. Traditionally, household chores are shared, but expectations vary. The wife is setting clear, minimal expectations. The husband's reluctance and snippiness might indicate a problem. The key points are communication and fairness.\n\nThe wife isn't asking for anything excessive. The tasks are basic and not particularly time-consuming. The husband's reaction suggests he might not be taking the responsibilities seriously or there's a lack of communication about their roles. The wife's frustration is valid because she's setting up expectations, and he's not meeting them despite them being simple.\n\nPossible angles: Is it fair to expect one person to handle all chores while the other is working? Shared responsibilities are important. If both are working, they should split chores. However, the wife is doing something for him (coffee setup), which shows she's contributing. The husband's resistance and negative attitude might be his issue, not the wife's.\n\nBut maybe the wife is making assumptions about his willingness or ability. If he's not doing it, maybe there's a reason, like work stress or different priorities. However, the scenario doesn't mention any such issues. The husband just isn't willing to do it and gets snippy.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the wife's expectations are reasonable. The husband's behavior (not doing the tasks and being snippy) is more concerning. So the author's expectations are not unreasonable. Therefore, the husband is in the wrong, not the author. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
