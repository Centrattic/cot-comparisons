      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their husband to clean the house while they're at work. The husband isn't doing the tasks as requested and gets snippy when only part is done.\n\nFirst, the author has a simple list of chores that shouldn't take long. They mention setting up the coffee pot for him. So it's not like they're being unreasonable. The husband isn't meeting expectations and has a bad attitude when he's only done part. That seems unfair. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's an issue with communication. Did they discuss the expectations beforehand? The author leaves a list, which is clear. The husband's reaction is snippiness, which might indicate resentment. Maybe the author assumes the husband is okay with this arrangement, but he's not happy. \n\nHowever, the author isn't asking for a lot. Basic cleaning tasks that take under an hour. It's reasonable for both partners to share household chores. If the husband is at home, it's fair to expect him to contribute. The problem arises when he doesn't do it and reacts poorly. \n\nThe key here is mutual responsibility. If the author is working and the husband is home, sharing chores is a fair expectation. The husband's refusal to do his share and getting snippy is the issue. So the author isn't in the wrong for expecting this. But maybe the husband's resentment isn't addressed. However, the question is about the author's rightness. \n\nSo the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They have a reasonable expectation. The husband's behavior is the problem.\n"
