      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their husband to clean the house while they're at work. The author leaves a simple list with basic tasks like sweeping, dishes, making the bed, etc., and even sets up the coffee pot. They mention it should take less than an hour. The husband doesn't do it, and when she points out he didn't do all the tasks, he gets snippy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author might feel they're asking for a reasonable amount of help, especially since they're working and the husband is at home. The husband's reaction is snippiness when the author is just pointing out he didn't complete all tasks. \n\nIn many relationships, sharing household chores is expected. If the author set up a clear list and the husband refuses or complains when not everything is done, maybe he's not pulling his weight. But maybe there's an imbalance in expectations. The author might be assuming the husband should handle this without considering his own workload or if he's not willing. However, the author isn't asking for much, just basic tasks. \n\nThe husband's snippiness when confronted suggests he might be defensive or resistant to helping. If the author is working and the husband is home, maybe the husband should take on more. But if the husband isn't capable or unwilling, then maybe the author's expectations are unreasonable. However, the tasks listed are simple and quick. \n\nIt also depends on the relationship dynamics. If this is a recurring issue and the husband is consistently not contributing, the author is justified in wanting help. The husband's reaction of getting snippy when the author points out incomplete tasks is probably his fault, but the author expecting help isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (the author isn't in the wrong) because the tasks are reasonable and the husband's behavior is the main issue. The author is not wrong for expecting help, especially if they contribute in other ways (like setting up the coffee pot).\n"
