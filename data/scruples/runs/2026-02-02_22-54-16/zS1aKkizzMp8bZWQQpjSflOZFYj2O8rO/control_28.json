      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a wife expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work. She leaves a simple list of tasks that should take less than an hour. He doesn't do them and gets annoyed when she's not happy with his partial effort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider expectations in a relationship. It's common for couples to share household responsibilities, but the fairness of the division can vary. The wife is setting clear, simple tasks, which isn't unreasonable. She's even helpful by setting up his coffee pot. The husband, on the other hand, isn't meeting these expectations and is getting snappy when she's not satisfied. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, maybe she's assuming he should automatically know to do the cleaning without a detailed list? However, she does provide a list, so that's clear. The tasks are minimal, so expecting him to do that while she's away isn't excessive. The husband's reaction seems more problematic\u2014being snippy and not fulfilling the tasks. \n\nHowever, relationships involve communication. Maybe there's a lack of discussion about their roles. If the husband is resistant, maybe there's an underlying issue. But based on the information given, the wife's expectations seem reasonable. The husband's unwillingness to do the tasks and his attitude are more likely the problem here. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
