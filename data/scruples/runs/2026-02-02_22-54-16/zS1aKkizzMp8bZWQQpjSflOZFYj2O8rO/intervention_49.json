      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author expects her husband to clean the house while she's at work, and he doesn't do it all or gets snippy when she points out he's missing some tasks.\n\nFirst, the author mentions she leaves a simple list of chores. They don't expect him to do anything gross or meticulous, just basic cleaning. She also sets up his coffee pot, which might be a kind gesture. The chores are supposed to take less than an hour. The husband either can't or won't do them and gets snippy when she's not praising him for doing 3/4 of the list.\n\nI need to consider if expecting a spouse to do basic chores while the other is at work is unreasonable. In many relationships, sharing household responsibilities is common. However, the key points here are the expectations and communication. The author lists specific tasks, which is good for clarity, but maybe the husband feels overwhelmed or the tasks aren't balanced. Also, the husband's reaction\u2014getting snippy and expecting praise\u2014might indicate an attitude problem. If he's not doing the tasks and is defensive or unappreciative, that could be his issue. The author isn't demanding perfection, just a simple list. If the husband is unwilling or unable to meet basic expectations, maybe the problem lies with him. But maybe the author hasn't discussed the expectations properly or considered his perspective. However, since she left a list and even helped him with the coffee, it seems she's made an effort. The husband's snippiness might be his fault. So, the author might not be in the wrong here. I'll go with B (No).\n"
