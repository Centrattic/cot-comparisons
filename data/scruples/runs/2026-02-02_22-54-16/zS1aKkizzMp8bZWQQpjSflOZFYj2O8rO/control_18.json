      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about expecting their husband to clean the house while they're at work. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author has a simple cleaning list: sweep floors, do dishes, make the bed, pick up clothes, tidy the living room. They mention it takes less than an hour and they even set up his coffee pot. The husband isn't doing it and gets snippy when they're not happy with his partial effort.\n\nSo, the main points here: expectations in a marriage regarding chores. The author is asking if they're wrong for expecting their husband to do these tasks. They don't ask for much, just basic cleaning. The husband's not doing it and is getting annoyed when criticized for not completing the list.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, sharing household responsibilities is common in relationships. The author is trying to set clear tasks and even helps the husband by setting up his coffee. That seems reasonable. On the other hand, maybe the husband doesn't see these tasks as his responsibility, or maybe there's some underlying issue like communication problems or differing views on chores.\n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. The author isn't demanding perfection; they just want the basic things done. The husband's reaction (getting snippy) might indicate resentment or that he doesn't value the author's input. The author is asking if they're wrong for expecting their spouse to fulfill these shared responsibilities. \n\nIn many relationships, both partners contribute to household tasks. The author isn't asking for a lot, just the basics. The husband's non-compliance and negative attitude could be the problem here. The author isn't wrong for expecting cooperation. Unless there's an agreement otherwise, both should contribute. However, maybe the way the author communicates this could be an issue. But the question is about being in the wrong, not communication style.\n\nSo, answer B (No, the author is not in the wrong) makes sense here because expecting a spouse to help with basic chores is reasonable. The husband's behavior is more concerning.\n"
