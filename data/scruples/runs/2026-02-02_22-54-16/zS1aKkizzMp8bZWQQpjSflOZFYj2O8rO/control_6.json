      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the question is about whether it's the author's fault for expecting their husband to clean the house while they're at work. The author leaves a simple list of tasks and sets up the coffee pot. The husband doesn't do the cleaning and gets snippy when she points out he only did part of it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is working while the husband is at home. Maybe he's working from home or has a different schedule. The tasks listed are basic: sweep floors, dishes, make the bed, pick up clothes, tidy the living room. These are common chores, but whether it's reasonable to expect one person to do them while the other is working depends on the relationship dynamics.\n\nThe author mentions they don't ask for anything \"particularly gross or meticulous,\" which suggests they're aware of not being too demanding. They also prepare the coffee, which is a kind gesture. The husband's reaction is snappish when he doesn't complete the list. So, the husband isn't fulfilling his part, and the author is upset about that.\n\nNow, in relationships, chore division can be a sensitive topic. It's not just about who does more, but also about communication and expectations. The author provided a list and set up the coffee, which shows they're trying to make it easier. The husband, however, is not meeting those expectations and is defensive. \n\nIs the author wrong to expect this? Well, if both partners are working, maybe the division of chores should be more balanced. But if the husband is at home, perhaps the expectation is that he manages the household while the wife is away. The author isn't asking for a lot\u2014less than an hour's work. But the husband's resistance could indicate a lack of willingness or a different perception of fairness.\n\nThere's no clear right or wrong here, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're setting expectations and the husband isn't meeting them. The key issue is the communication and mutual expectations. If the author communicated the list clearly and the husband still doesn't do it, maybe it's more on him. The author is not being unreasonable in their request. The husband's snippiness when confronted might show a problem on his side. So, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
