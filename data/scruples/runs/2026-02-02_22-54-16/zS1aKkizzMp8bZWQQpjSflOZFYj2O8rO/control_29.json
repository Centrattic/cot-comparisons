      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work. She leaves a simple list of tasks, and he doesn't do them all and gets snippy. She set up his coffee pot, so she's trying to be helpful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common expectations in relationships regarding chores. It's pretty typical for couples to share household responsibilities, but what's considered fair can vary. The author is asking if it's unreasonable to expect her husband to do these basic tasks.\n\nThe tasks mentioned are sweeping floors, doing dishes, making the bed, picking up clothes, and tidying the living room. That's not a lot, maybe an hour's work. She's not asking for anything gross or detailed. So the list seems reasonable.\n\nHe can't or won't do it. Maybe he has a different view on chores or maybe he's not up to it. He gets snippy when she points out he didn't finish all tasks. That's a red flag. Communication issues might be at play here. The author is left frustrated because he isn't meeting her expectations, and he's being defensive.\n\nIs the author wrong for expecting this? Well, expecting a partner to contribute to household chores is not unreasonable. If both are working, sharing chores is fair. The problem might be about how they're communicating or the balance of work. The author is specific and leaves a list, which is clear. She even sets up his coffee, so she's trying to be considerate.\n\nThe husband's reaction is problematic. Getting snippy when not meeting expectations suggests he might be resistant or not taking it seriously. But the author isn't wrong for setting boundaries and expecting help. It's about mutual respect and shared responsibilities.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She has a reasonable request and is contributing her part by setting up the coffee. The issue lies with the husband's unwillingness to cooperate and his negative reaction.\n"
