      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work. She provides a simple list of tasks that should take less than an hour. He doesn't do them and gets snippy when she's not happy with 3/4 done. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is setting clear expectations with a list. She's even helping by setting up his coffee. The tasks are simple and not excessive. On the other hand, maybe the husband feels overwhelmed or resents being told what to do. Or maybe he's not able to manage his time well. \n\nIn relationships, it's common for partners to share household chores. The problem here might be communication. Did they discuss this chore division? If the husband isn't doing his part and gets defensive, that's an issue. But maybe the author is being too rigid? Like, if the husband is working too and the list seems too much for him. But she says it's simple and takes less than an hour. \n\nAlso, her tone when pointing out he did 3/4 might come off as critical. Maybe she's not acknowledging his efforts enough. But the main point is she's asking if she's wrong for expecting him to do these tasks. \n\nFrom the info given, she's not being unreasonable. The tasks are basic. Unless there's more context like his workload, but the question doesn't mention that. So, probably not her fault. Answer B.\n"
