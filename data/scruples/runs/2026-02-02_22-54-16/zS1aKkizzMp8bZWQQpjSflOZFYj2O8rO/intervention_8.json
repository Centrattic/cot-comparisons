      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work and he's at home.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author leaves a simple cleaning list for her husband. The tasks are basic: sweep floors, do dishes, make the bed, pick up clothes, tidy the living room. She doesn't ask for anything gross or meticulous and even sets up his coffee pot. She mentions it should take less than an hour. However, the husband can't or won't do it and gets snippy when she points out he only did 3/4 of the tasks. The author is asking if she's at fault here.\n\nI think about expectations in relationships. It's common for couples to share household responsibilities. The author is setting clear expectations with a list, which is reasonable. She's not overburdening him; the tasks are simple and time-efficient. The husband's response\u2014getting snippy and not completing tasks\u2014seems like the issue. The fact that the author is working while he's at home might be a factor in why she expects him to handle the cleaning when he has the time. \n\nBut maybe there's a cultural or personal expectation aspect. In some cases, people might assume different roles, but the question is about whether the author is wrong. Since she's not demanding perfection, just basic cleanliness, and she's contributing by setting up his coffee, it seems balanced. The husband's refusal or inability to meet even these minimal tasks without getting defensive would be the problem.\n\nAnother angle: communication. The author has communicated her expectations clearly. If the husband is struggling, perhaps they need to discuss it, but the author isn't the one avoiding communication. The husband's snippiness is a red flag. The author isn't in the wrong for expecting her partner to do his part, especially when it's reasonable and communicated.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the husband has other responsibilities or doesn't want to clean. But the author isn't forcing him to do more than her share. If he's at home, it's logical that he can manage basic cleaning. The key is that the tasks are simple and the author is not being unreasonable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
