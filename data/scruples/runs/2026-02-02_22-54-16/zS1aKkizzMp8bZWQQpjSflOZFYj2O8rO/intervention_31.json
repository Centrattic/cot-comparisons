I don\u2019t ask him to do anything particularly gross or meticulous and even set up his coffee pot for when he wakes up. \nIt\u2019s not a lot and should take less than an hour to accomplish. \nHe can\u2019t/won\u2019t do it and gets snippy when I don\u2019t hit my knees to praise him for only doing 3/4s. \nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband who isn't doing the housework as expected.\n\nThe author expects her husband to clean the house during the day when she's at work. She leaves a simple list of tasks that take less than an hour. She mentions she doesn't ask for much and even sets up his coffee. But he doesn't do it all and gets snippy when she points out he only did part of it. The author is wondering if she's the one at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider fairness in expectations. The tasks listed are basic and not excessive. The husband has the time (since he's at home) to do them. The author isn't demanding perfection, just a simple list. She's also doing something thoughtful by setting up his coffee. \n\nThen, the husband's reaction is the issue. Getting snippy when she points out partial completion might indicate a lack of cooperation or maybe a different view on household responsibilities. But does that make the author wrong? \n\nIn relationships, division of chores can vary. Some couples split tasks, others take turns, or one person handles more. The author isn't forcing him to do a lot; she's asking for basic cleanliness. It's reasonable to expect a partner to contribute to shared responsibilities, especially when it's a manageable list and she's working outside the home.\n\nThe husband's unwillingness and negative response might stem from not valuing the shared responsibility or maybe other stressors. However, the author's side seems fair. She's setting clear expectations and even helping him out with the coffee. The problem isn't with her expectations but possibly his willingness to cooperate.\n\nSo, based on this, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
