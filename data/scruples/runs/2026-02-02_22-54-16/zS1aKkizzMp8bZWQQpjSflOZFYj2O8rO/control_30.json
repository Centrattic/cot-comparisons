      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work. The author lists simple tasks like sweeping, dishes, making the bed, picking up clothes, and tidying the living room. She mentions she doesn't expect much and even sets up his coffee. The husband doesn't do it and gets snippy when she's upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common expectations in relationships. Typically, chores are shared, but there's no one-size-fits-all. The author's request seems reasonable. The tasks listed are basic and not overly time-consuming. She's given a list, which suggests she's organized and clear about expectations. The husband's refusal and snappiness might indicate a lack of willingness to share responsibilities or communication issues.\n\nBut then, maybe the husband has his own reasons for not doing the chores. Maybe he's overwhelmed, has different priorities, or there's a miscommunication. The question is whether the author is wrong for expecting this. The key points are mutual respect, communication, and fairness. If the author isn't demanding perfection and the tasks are simple, it's hard to say she's wrong. However, if there's no discussion or agreement on household responsibilities from the start, that could be a problem. The husband's reaction is also important; being snippy is not respectful. \n\nSo the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because her request is reasonable and she's set up the husband to help. But maybe there's more context needed. However, based solely on the provided information, the author's expectations are reasonable and she's not overstepping. The husband's refusal and negative reaction are the issues here.\n"
