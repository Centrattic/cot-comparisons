      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong for expecting their husband to clean the house while he's at home and she's at work. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations set by the author. They mention leaving a simple list with basic tasks that should take less than an hour. These tasks are not overly demanding. The husband, however, isn't completing them and gets snippy when she's not praising him for doing part of it.\n\nSo, the key points here are mutual expectations and communication. The author is setting clear, manageable tasks. The husband isn't meeting those expectations and is reacting negatively. The author isn't demanding something unreasonable, just basic household maintenance. \n\nIn relationships, it's common for partners to share household responsibilities. The fact that the author even sets up the coffee pot shows some effort to ease the husband's routine. However, the husband's resistance and negative attitude might be the issue here. \n\nBut the question is about the author's rightness. Since she's asking if she's at fault for expecting her husband to do what she's outlined, and given that the tasks are simple and she's not demanding perfection, it's more likely that the husband isn't meeting his part of the agreement. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
