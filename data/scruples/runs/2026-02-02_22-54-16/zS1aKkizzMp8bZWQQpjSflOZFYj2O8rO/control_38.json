      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their husband to clean the house while they're at work. The author leaves a simple list of tasks that should take less than an hour. They mention setting up the husband's coffee pot. The husband doesn't do the tasks and gets snippy when not praised for only doing part of it.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author's expectations are minimal: basic cleaning tasks. They don't ask for anything gross or meticulous. The husband isn't doing them and is getting defensive. The author is asking if they're at fault here.\n\nI should consider factors like communication, mutual expectations, and effort. The author provides a list, which is clear. The husband's refusal might stem from differing views on chores or lack of communication. The author isn't demanding perfection, just basic tasks. The husband's reaction of getting snippy when not praised suggests he might be resistant to the expectation. \n\nBut the author isn't the one refusing to participate. They set up the coffee, which is a kind gesture. The problem is the husband not meeting the expectations. Unless there's an agreement that the author isn't respecting, it seems the husband isn't fulfilling his part. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
