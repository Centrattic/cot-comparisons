I don\u2019t ask him to do anything particularly gross or meticulous and even set up his coffee pot for when he wakes up. \nIt\u2019s not a lot and should take less than an hour to accomplish. \nHe can\u2019t/won\u2019t do it and gets snippy when I don\u2019t hit my knees to praise him for only doing 3/4s. \nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work. The author provided a list of simple tasks that take less than an hour. She's not asking for anything overly complicated or gross. She even sets up his coffee pot, which is a kind gesture.\n\nThe husband isn't doing the tasks and gets snippy when she points out he didn't finish. That's a red flag. Communication is key in any relationship. If the husband is struggling with the tasks, there should be a discussion to find a solution. Maybe he's overwhelmed or doesn't know how to do certain things. But getting snippy when she checks on his progress sounds like he's not taking responsibility. \n\nExpecting a partner to contribute to household chores is reasonable, especially if they're both working. It's about teamwork and shared responsibilities. The author isn't being unreasonable here. She's setting clear, simple tasks. The husband's behavior seems to be the issue here\u2014resisting help and being short-tempered. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer should be B. The author isn't in the wrong. The husband is not meeting the expectations set for him and is reacting poorly, which points to his responsibility in the situation.\n"
