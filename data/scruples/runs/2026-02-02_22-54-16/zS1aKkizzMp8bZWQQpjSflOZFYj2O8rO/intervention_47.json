      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see, the situation is that the author expects her husband to clean the house while she's at work and he's at home. She gives him a simple list of tasks, and she doesn't think it's too much. But he can't or won't do it and gets snippy when she points out he didn't do all of it.\n\nFirst, I should consider the expectations. She left a list of basic chores: sweep floors, do dishes, make the bed, pick up clothes, tidy the living room. Those don't sound unreasonable. She even set up his coffee pot for him. She mentions it should take less than an hour. Maybe the husband is not doing his share, which is causing tension.\n\nThe key here is whether the expectation is fair. Dividing chores in a marriage can be subjective. If the author is working and the husband is at home, maybe there's an assumption that he should handle more domestic duties. But maybe the husband isn't used to it, or they didn't agree on this division. The fact that the husband gets snippy when she points out he didn't do all the tasks might indicate he's being defensive or avoiding responsibility.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, she's setting expectations and providing a list, which is reasonable. She's not asking for anything excessive. The problem seems to be on the husband's side for not meeting those expectations. The author isn't demanding praise or being harsh, just pointing out incomplete tasks. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author isn't considering the husband's perspective. Did they discuss this division of labor beforehand? If the husband didn't agree to this, then maybe the author is overstepping. But since she's the one asking if she's in the wrong, maybe the husband's resistance is the main issue here.\n\nAnother angle: Cultural or gender norms might play a role. Some might argue that expecting a spouse to handle chores while the other works is fair, especially if the husband is at home. However, if there's a lack of communication or mutual agreement, that could be a problem. But from the given information, the author seems to have set clear, simple tasks without overcomplicating things. The husband's attitude is the main issue here.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. She's setting reasonable expectations and the husband's failure to meet them and his snippiness are the core problems. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
