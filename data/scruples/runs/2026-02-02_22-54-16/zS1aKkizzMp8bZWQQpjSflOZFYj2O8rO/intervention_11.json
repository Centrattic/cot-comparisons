      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about expecting their husband to clean the house while they're at work. The author leaves a simple list of tasks that should take less than an hour. The husband doesn't do them and gets snippy when not everything is done.\n\nHmm, first, expectations in a relationship can vary. The author is asking if it's their fault for expecting help. They mention they don't ask for much and even set up the coffee pot. The husband's response is dismissive and he gets annoyed when not all tasks are done. \n\nI need to consider if the expectations are reasonable. The tasks are basic and not excessive. Setting up the coffee pot is a nice touch, showing the author is trying to make it easier. The husband's refusal to do the tasks and the snippiness when not all are done might indicate he's not taking responsibility. \n\nBut maybe the author didn't communicate clearly? However, the list is simple. The time is less than an hour, which seems manageable. The husband's behavior is the issue here\u2014refusing to do his part and being snarky. \n\nIn relationships, sharing household duties is common. If one person is consistently doing more, it can lead to resentment. The author is trying to divide tasks, which is fair. The husband's resistance and attitude might be the real problem here. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for expecting help. The husband's response points to his own shortcomings. The answer should be B (No).\n"
