      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see. The question is about whether the author (a wife) is at fault for expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work and he's at home.\n\nFirst, let me break down the details. She says she leaves a simple list of tasks: sweep floors, do dishes, make the bed, pick up dirty clothes, tidy the living room. She doesn't ask for anything gross or meticulous. She also sets up his coffee pot. She claims it should take less than an hour. The husband doesn't do it, and gets snippy when she's not happy with him doing part of it. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Well, expectations in a relationship can vary. Some people might think it's reasonable to split chores, others might not. The wife is working while he's at home, so maybe she's trying to balance the household responsibilities. But maybe he's not used to doing chores or doesn't see them as his responsibility. The fact that he gets snippy when she's not praising him for doing 3/4 of the tasks suggests he's defensive or maybe not taking her expectations seriously.\n\nBut is expecting the husband to do these basic chores unreasonable? The list is pretty simple and not time-consuming. If she's not asking for anything too involved, then maybe it's fair. However, in a relationship, communication is key. Maybe they didn't discuss the division of chores, leading to misunderstandings. The husband's reaction could indicate he's not on board with these expectations, so maybe there's a lack of communication on both sides.\n\nOn the other hand, expecting someone to do chores when they're at home could be seen as fair, especially if the wife is working. But if the husband is resistant and gets snippy, that's a problem. The wife might be in the right for expecting some help, but maybe she's not considering his perspective. However, the husband's behavior in responding with snippiness when she's not happy is probably not good either.\n\nI think the key points here are: the tasks are minimal, she's setting up his coffee, which shows she's trying to be helpful. The husband's refusal to do the tasks and the snippiness when he half-does them could be his issue. So maybe the wife isn't in the wrong here. But maybe there's a cultural or personal norm difference. In some cultures, men don't do chores, so maybe the husband is not used to that. However, if they are in a partnership, sharing chores is reasonable.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards the wife not being in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
