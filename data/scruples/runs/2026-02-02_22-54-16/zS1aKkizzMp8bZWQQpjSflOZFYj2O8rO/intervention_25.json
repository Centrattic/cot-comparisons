I don\u2019t ask him to do anything particularly gross or meticulous and even set up his coffee pot for when he wakes up. \nIt\u2019s not a lot and should take less than an hour to accomplish. \nHe can\u2019t/won\u2019t do it and gets snippy when I don\u2019t hit my knees to praise him for only doing 3/4s. \nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their husband to clean the house while they're at work. The author leaves a simple list of chores, which shouldn't take long. The husband doesn't do them and gets snappy when she points out he didn't finish.\n\nHmm, first, the question is about whether the expectation is reasonable. The author is not expecting anything extreme, just basic tasks. They even set up his coffee, which is a kind gesture. The husband's reaction seems to be the problem here. If the author is asking for a fair share of household responsibilities, then maybe she's not in the wrong. But maybe some people might say that expecting a spouse to do chores while working is too much, but the chores here are minimal.\n\nThe answer depends on cultural or personal views on household responsibilities. But in many modern contexts, sharing chores is expected. The husband's attitude of not doing them and getting snippy is more problematic. The author is just asking for what's reasonable. So likely the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
