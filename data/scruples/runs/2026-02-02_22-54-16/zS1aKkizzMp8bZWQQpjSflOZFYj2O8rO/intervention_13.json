      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author expects their husband to clean the house while they're at work. They leave a simple list of tasks that should take less than an hour. The husband doesn't do it and gets snippy when she points out he didn't finish all the tasks. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. The author isn't asking for much\u2014basic tasks like sweeping, doing the dishes, making the bed, etc. They even set up his coffee pot, which seems like a considerate gesture. The husband isn't doing the tasks and is getting snippy when she brings up the incomplete list. \n\nNow, in a relationship, sharing household responsibilities is common. It's about fairness and communication. The author is setting clear expectations with a list, which is a good approach. The husband, on the other hand, isn't meeting those expectations and is getting defensive or irritated when confronted. That could indicate a problem with his attitude or willingness to contribute. \n\nBut maybe there's more to the story. Do they have an agreement about chores? If the author expects the husband to do these tasks while she's away, but he's not on board, that could be an issue. It might be that the husband feels overwhelmed, or perhaps there's a lack of communication about their roles. However, the author mentions the tasks are simple and take less than an hour, so unless there's a valid reason (like work constraints), the husband's refusal seems unreasonable. \n\nAlso, the husband's reaction\u2014getting snippy when only half the tasks are done\u2014suggests he might not take the responsibilities seriously or is resentful. The author isn't demanding perfection, just the basics. The fact that the author is trying to be helpful (setting up his coffee) shows they're trying to make it easier for him. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's common for both partners to contribute. If the author is working and the husband is at home, it makes sense for him to handle some chores. The problem seems to be the husband's unwillingness and negative reaction. So the author isn't in the wrong for expecting him to do his share. The husband's behavior is likely the main issue here. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
