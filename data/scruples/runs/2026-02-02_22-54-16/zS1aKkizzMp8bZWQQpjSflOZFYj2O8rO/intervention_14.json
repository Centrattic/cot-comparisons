      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their husband to clean the house while they're at work. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author leaves a simple to-do list: sweep floors, do dishes, make the bed, pick up clothes, and tidy the living room. That doesn't sound unreasonable. They mention it should take less than an hour, which is a reasonable time frame. Also, they set up the husband's coffee pot, which seems like a considerate gesture, maybe to make the task easier or more pleasant for him.\n\nThe husband, however, can't or won't do it, and gets snippy when she points out he only did part of the list. The key points here are the expectations and communication. The author is clear about what's needed, and the husband isn't meeting those expectations. The husband's reaction is negative, which adds tension.\n\nNow, considering societal norms, shared household responsibilities are a common topic. Both partners should contribute, but the balance can vary based on individual circumstances. The author isn't asking for a lot, just basic tasks. The husband's refusal or inability to do it, combined with his negative reaction, seems like the main issue here.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They set clear expectations and provided support (coffee pot). They're not demanding perfection, just the basics. The husband's behavior is problematic. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're setting reasonable expectations and the issue lies with the husband not fulfilling his part and reacting poorly.\n"
