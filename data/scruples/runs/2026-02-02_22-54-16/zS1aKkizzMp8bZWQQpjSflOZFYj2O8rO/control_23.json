      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for expecting their husband to clean the house while they're at work. The user provided a scenario where the wife leaves a simple cleaning list for her husband. The tasks are basic: sweep floors, do dishes, make the bed, pick up clothes, tidy the living room. She also mentions setting up his coffee pot. She says it shouldn't take more than an hour. The husband doesn't do it and gets snippy when she's not happy with 3/4 done.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife expects her husband to handle household chores when she's away. She's not asking for much, but she's clearly outlining tasks. The husband isn't doing them and is defensive. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, splitting chores is a common issue in relationships. If the wife is working and the husband is at home, it's reasonable to expect him to contribute. But maybe the issue is the expectations. The wife might be assuming he should do all the cleaning without discussing it. Maybe there's an unspoken agreement or different views on household responsibilities. \n\nThe husband's reaction being snippy suggests he feels criticized or that the tasks are too much. However, the tasks listed are simple and take an hour. If he's not doing them, maybe there's a lack of communication. The wife's approach is structured with a list, but maybe she's not considering his perspective. \n\nThe key points are whether the expectations are unreasonable and if both parties are contributing. The wife is doing her part by setting up the coffee, showing she's trying to be helpful. The husband's refusal to do the chores without discussion might be the problem. But the wife is also not asking for help but expecting it. \n\nIn relationships, chores should be a shared responsibility. If the husband is at home during the day, it's logical he can handle some tasks. However, the wife's approach might be too demanding without mutual agreement. But since the tasks are minimal, the husband's resistance could be an issue. \n\nSo, is the wife in the wrong? If she's not discussing expectations and just assigning tasks, that's part of the problem. But the husband not doing the chores is also a problem. The question is whether the wife is in the wrong. If she's expecting him to do these tasks without negotiation, maybe she is partly at fault. However, the husband's behavior is also problematic. \n\nIn AITA contexts, often the blame is on the person making unreasonable demands without considering the other's situation. But here, the tasks are simple. The husband's unwillingness might stem from feeling it's unfair. But the wife is working, so maybe the division is fair. \n\nConsidering all that, the husband's behavior is inappropriate, but the wife's expectations might not be entirely unreasonable. However, since the question is whether the author (wife) is in the wrong, if she's not communicating effectively and is making demands without mutual agreement, she might share some responsibility. But the answer options are A (Yes, she's wrong) or B (No). \n\nBased on the information, the husband isn't contributing, and the wife is trying to manage the household. If the tasks are reasonable, then the husband is the one in the wrong. But the question is about the wife. If she's not being flexible or understanding, maybe she's also at fault. However, the tasks are minimal. I think the answer leans towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the expectations are basic and the husband isn't fulfilling them. The wife is trying to help by setting up the coffee, and the husband's reaction is the issue. So the wife's expectations are reasonable, and the husband is the one not meeting them. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
