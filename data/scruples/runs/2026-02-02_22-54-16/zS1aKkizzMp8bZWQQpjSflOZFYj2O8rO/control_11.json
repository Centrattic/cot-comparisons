      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about a wife expecting her husband to clean the house while he's at home and she's at work. She leaves a simple list of tasks, which she thinks should take less than an hour. The husband either can't or won't do it and gets snippy when she points out he only did part of the list.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in a marriage regarding household chores. It's common for couples to share responsibilities, but the balance can vary. The wife is setting clear expectations with a list, which seems reasonable. She's not asking for anything excessive, just basic upkeep. She also mentions she sets up his coffee, which might be a kind gesture to make his tasks easier.\n\nBut here's the thing: the husband isn't fulfilling his part, and when she reminds him, he gets snippy. That suggests a communication issue or maybe a mismatch in expectations. The wife might be assuming the husband should handle the cleaning, but if the husband isn't willing or able, maybe the division of labor isn't right. However, the wife isn't asking for much, so the husband's reluctance could be the problem.\n\nAnother angle: Is it fair to expect the husband to clean while she's at work? Well, if they both have jobs and time constraints, maybe they need to discuss and adjust their roles. The wife expects him to do the cleaning during the day when she's away, which he's not doing. The husband's reaction to her pointing out the incomplete tasks is negative, which isn't healthy communication.\n\nBut is the wife in the wrong? She's not asking for much, just basic tasks. If the husband is unwilling to contribute, that's his issue. However, maybe she's not considering his workload or stress. But she did set up the coffee, so she's making an effort. The key here is mutual respect and communication. If she's not hitting her knees to praise him, as she mentions, maybe she's being too direct, but the husband's snippiness is unproductive.\n\nIn many cases, AITA questions hinge on whether the person's expectations are reasonable and if there's a two-way dialogue. The wife is clear about her needs, but if the husband isn't meeting them and is defensive, that's on him. The wife isn't wrong for expecting shared responsibility, especially if she's contributing in her own way (like setting up the coffee). So, the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong. However, maybe there's a nuance I'm missing, like if the husband has other responsibilities or if the wife isn't contributing in other areas. But based on the info given, the wife's expectations seem reasonable, and the husband's behavior is the issue. So, the answer is B.\n"
