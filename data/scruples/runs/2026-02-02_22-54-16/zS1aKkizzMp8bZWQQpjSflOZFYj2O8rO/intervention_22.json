      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a wife expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work. She gives a simple list of tasks and feels it's not too much, but he either can't or won't do them and gets snippy when she's not happy with the results.\n\nFirst, I need to consider typical expectations in a marriage. Sharing household chores is common, but the specifics matter here. The wife is setting up a reasonable list and even helps by making his coffee. The husband, on the other hand, isn't fulfilling his part and gets defensive. \n\nI should think about whether the wife is being unfair. She's not asking for anything excessive, just basic tasks. Maybe the issue is communication. Did they discuss the division of chores before? If she set these expectations without considering his input, maybe there's a problem. But she mentions she doesn't expect much and leaves a simple list, so maybe it's a fair request.\n\nThe husband's reaction is key. Getting snippy and not doing the tasks suggests he might not be taking responsibility. The wife isn't asking for praise, just for him to do the tasks. If the husband is unwilling to contribute, that's his issue. \n\nHowever, maybe the wife didn't consider his workload or preferences. If they didn't have a prior agreement, she might be assuming too much. But the tasks listed are minimal, so it's hard to see how they're unreasonable. \n\nIn terms of fairness, splitting chores is part of a healthy relationship. If one partner refuses to do their part, they're in the wrong. The wife is asking for a small, specific task list, which shouldn't be unreasonable. The husband's behavior is more problematic here. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's asking for a reasonable amount and the husband isn't meeting his responsibilities.\n"
