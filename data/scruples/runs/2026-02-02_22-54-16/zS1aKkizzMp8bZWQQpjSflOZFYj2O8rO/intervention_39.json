      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author expects her husband to clean the house while she's at work. She leaves a simple list with tasks like sweeping, dishes, making the bed, picking up clothes, and tidying the living room. She doesn't ask for anything gross or meticulous and even sets up his coffee. She thinks it's not a lot, under an hour. The husband can't or won't do it and gets snippy when she points out he only did 3/4 of the tasks. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants to know if the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from both sides. The wife is asking for basic household chores that take an hour. It's reasonable to expect a partner to contribute to shared responsibilities. Setting up his coffee is a nice touch, showing she's considerate. The husband not doing the tasks and getting snippy seems like the issue here. The key points are mutual responsibility in a marriage, communication, and expectations.\n\nIn many relationships, both partners are expected to share household duties. The wife isn't asking for much, which makes it seem fair. The husband's reaction (getting snippy) indicates a lack of cooperation or communication. The author isn't in the wrong for expecting her husband to help, especially since they are a team. The problem might be in how the expectation is communicated or the husband's willingness to participate.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the husband has other responsibilities or the wife isn't doing her share. But the question doesn't mention that. The wife says she doesn't expect much and the tasks are minimal. The husband's refusal and attitude are the main issues here. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B."
