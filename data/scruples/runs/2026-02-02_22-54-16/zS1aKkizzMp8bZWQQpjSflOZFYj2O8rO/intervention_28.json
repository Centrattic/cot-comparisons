      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work. The situation is that she leaves a simple list of tasks, and he doesn't do them, gets snippy, and she's upset when he doesn't do all of them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's asking if she's at fault. The key points here are the expectations and communication between the couple. She mentions the tasks are simple and take less than an hour. She also sets up his coffee, which seems like she's trying to be helpful. \n\nNow, is it reasonable to expect the husband to do these tasks? Well, household responsibilities can be a common point of conflict in relationships. The fact that she left a list suggests she's clear about her expectations. However, the husband is not meeting them and gets defensive. \n\nBut wait, is she making a fair request? Maybe the issue is about the division of labor in their household. If they have an agreement or if there's an unspoken understanding about chores, not meeting those could be a problem. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. \n\nShe doesn't seem to be asking for a lot\u2014basic cleaning tasks. It's also worth considering cultural or personal norms. Some people might think splitting chores is just part of being in a partnership. If the husband is resistant and doesn't communicate his issues with the task list, that's on him. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author isn't considering the husband's perspective. If he's working and she's working, maybe he's overwhelmed or has different views on household chores. However, she's not asking him to do something excessive, just basic tasks. \n\nThe husband getting snippy when she points out he didn't do all the tasks suggests a lack of cooperation. So, if the author is setting clear expectations and the husband is failing to meet them, then she might not be in the wrong. The problem seems to be on the husband's side for not fulfilling his part and reacting poorly. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B).\n"
