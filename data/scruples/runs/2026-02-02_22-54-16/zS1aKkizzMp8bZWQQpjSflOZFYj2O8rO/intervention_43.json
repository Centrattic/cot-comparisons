      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is at fault for expecting their husband to clean the house while they're at work. The author mentions leaving a simple list of tasks that should take under an hour. The husband doesn't do them and gets snippy when not everything is done.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations here. The author doesn't ask for much\u2014basic cleaning tasks. They also set up the coffee pot, which is a kind gesture. The husband's reaction is part of the issue; he gets snippy instead of handling it calmly. \n\nNow, in relationships, dividing chores can be tricky. It's common for couples to expect each other to contribute to household tasks. However, communication is key. Did the author and husband discuss their expectations beforehand? If the husband agreed to take on these tasks, then he's at fault for not following through. If there was no prior agreement, maybe the author should have discussed it more clearly.\n\nBut the author is asking if they're in the wrong. From the given info, the tasks are simple and reasonable. The husband's refusal and negative attitude seem to be the problem. The author isn't asking for perfection, just basic cleanliness. So, the husband's behavior is the issue here, not the author's expectations.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author is at work and the husband is at home might mean he has the time to do these tasks. The author is balancing work and home, expecting reciprocal support. It's reasonable to expect some help, especially when they're both home. The husband not doing his share and being snippy is likely the main problem.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for expecting help with basic chores. The husband's resistance and attitude are the issues. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
