      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for expecting their husband to clean the house when they're at work and he's at home. The author leaves a simple list of tasks that aren't too demanding and even sets up his coffee pot. The husband doesn't do all the tasks and gets snippy when the author points out he only did 3/4. \n\nFirst, I need to consider expectations in a relationship. It's common for couples to share household responsibilities, but the specifics matter. The author's list is basic and takes less than an hour, so it's reasonable. They don't ask for anything gross or meticulous, which suggests they're not overstepping. Setting up the coffee pot shows consideration, which might imply they're trying to make it easier for him.\n\nThe husband's reaction is key here. If he's been consistently not helping and then gets snippy when reminded, that points to his behavior being the issue. The author isn't demanding perfection but a simple list. The husband's snippiness when only part of the list is done indicates he's resistant to accountability.\n\nI should also think about communication. Maybe the author and husband haven't discussed their expectations clearly. But the author states they leave a list, which is a form of communication. The husband's unwillingness to follow through despite that could be his fault. \n\nAnother angle: time and effort. The author is at work while the husband is at home. It's logical that the one present would handle the cleaning. The tasks are minimal, so it's not unreasonable. The husband's refusal and negative reaction make him the one in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The husband's behavior is the problem here.\n"
