      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author says she leaves a simple list of tasks: sweeping, dishes, making the bed, picking up clothes, tidying the living room. She doesn't ask for anything gross or detailed. She even sets up his coffee. She thinks it should take less than an hour. The husband doesn't do it and gets snippy when she's not happy with 3/4 done. She's asking if she's at fault.\n\nHmm. To determine if she's in the wrong, I need to consider expectations in a relationship. Sharing household responsibilities is a common topic. The key points here are the tasks themselves, the communication, and the husband's response.\n\nFirst, the tasks are basic and not overly demanding. She's not asking for a deep clean or anything that's time-consuming. She's providing a list, so there's some structure. She's also doing something nice by setting up his coffee, which might indicate she's trying to be considerate. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's response is negative. He doesn't do the tasks and gets snippy when she's upset. That's a red flag. If he's unwilling to contribute, that's a problem. But is the author wrong to expect him to help? \n\nIn many relationships, both partners are expected to share chores. If the author is working while he's at home, it's reasonable to expect him to handle some responsibilities when she's away. However, there might be underlying issues. Maybe he's resentful or there's a lack of communication about expectations. \n\nBut the author is asking if she's in the wrong. If she's communicated her expectations clearly and he's not meeting them, that's his issue. The fact that he gets snippy when she's not satisfied with his incomplete work suggests he's not being cooperative. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. She's setting reasonable expectations and the husband isn't fulfilling his part. The problem lies with his unwillingness to contribute and his negative attitude, not her expectations. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
