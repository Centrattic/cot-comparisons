      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband and wife where the wife expects her husband to clean the house while she's at work. She leaves a simple list of tasks that shouldn't take long. The husband doesn't do it and gets snippy when she points out he didn't complete everything.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common expectations in a marriage regarding household responsibilities. It's pretty standard for couples to share chores. The wife isn't asking for much\u2014basic cleaning tasks. She even sets up his coffee, which is a nice gesture. The husband's response is negative, getting snippy, which suggests a lack of cooperation or respect.\n\nBut then, is the wife being unreasonable? The tasks are simple and take less than an hour. If the husband is at home, he has the time to do it. The key point here is mutual effort. The wife is contributing by setting up his coffee, so expecting him to do the cleaning isn't unfair. The husband not doing his part and reacting poorly seems to be the issue here. The wife isn't demanding perfection just because he's done part of the list. She's pointing out he didn't complete all tasks, which is reasonable. The husband's attitude is what's problematic, not the wife's expectations. So the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
