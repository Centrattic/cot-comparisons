      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the wife leaves a simple cleaning list: sweep floors, do dishes, make the bed, pick up dirty clothes, tidy the living room. She doesn't ask for anything gross or meticulous. She even sets up his coffee pot. She says it should take less than an hour. The husband doesn't do it and gets snippy when she points out he only did 3/4. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From what I know about relationships, expectations can vary a lot. But in this case, she's setting clear, simple tasks. She's not asking for a lot. The husband not doing them and being snippy sounds like he's not pulling his weight, maybe. But maybe there's more context. For example, does the husband have other responsibilities? Are there health issues? Maybe the wife is overstepping if she's expecting him to do this without considering his own workload. But based on the info given, she's asking for minimal tasks. The husband's reaction is negative, which could indicate he's not cooperative. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if both partners are working, it's reasonable to share household chores. The wife is setting a manageable list, so expecting her husband to contribute isn't unreasonable. The husband not doing it and getting snippy is probably on him. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
