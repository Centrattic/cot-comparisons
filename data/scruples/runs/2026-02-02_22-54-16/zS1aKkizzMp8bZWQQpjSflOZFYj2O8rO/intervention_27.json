      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is about expecting their husband to clean the house while they're at work and he's at home. The author mentions they leave a simple list with basic tasks like sweeping, dishes, making the bed, picking up clothes, and tidying the living room. They also set up his coffee pot. The husband doesn't do all the tasks and gets snippy when she's not happy about it.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The author is asking if it's unreasonable to expect their husband to handle these chores when they're both working. The tasks listed are pretty standard and not overly time-consuming. The author is not asking for anything particularly messy or complicated, just basic cleaning. They also do a small favor for the husband by setting up his coffee.\n\nOn the other side, the husband isn't completing the tasks and is getting annoyed when she points out he only did part of them. The main issue here seems to be the division of household responsibilities. The author might feel that since they're both working, the chores should be shared, but the husband isn't contributing as expected. The author's expectation is reasonable, and the husband's reaction (getting snippy) could indicate a problem in communication or differing views on household duties.\n\nI should consider common perspectives on this. In many relationships, sharing chores is expected, especially when both partners work. The author isn't demanding perfection, just a basic level of cleanliness. The husband, however, is not meeting the agreed-upon expectations and is being defensive. That might point to the husband not being cooperative, which could make the author not the asshole in this scenario.\n\nBut wait, maybe the author didn't set clear expectations or didn't communicate effectively. However, they mention leaving a simple list, so that seems like they've tried to be clear. The husband's refusal to do the tasks and snippiness when reminded could be the issue. The fact that the author is working while the husband is at home might mean they have different schedules, so the timing of the chores could be a factor. If the husband is home, maybe he's in a position to handle the cleaning more easily than the author when she's away.\n\nAnother angle is the husband's reaction. If he's getting snippy when she points out he didn't finish, that's a red flag. It might indicate disrespect or unwillingness to share responsibilities. The author isn't demanding but is asking for a basic standard that takes under an hour. The husband's non-compliance and attitude could be the root of the problem here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's expectations seem reasonable, and the husband's behavior is the issue. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
