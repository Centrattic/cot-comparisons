      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. Let me read through it again.\n\nThe user is a spouse expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work. She leaves a simple list of tasks: sweep floors, do dishes, make the bed, pick up clothes, tidy the living room. She also sets up his coffee pot. She says it's not a lot, taking less than an hour. The husband doesn't do it and gets snippy when she's upset. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, expectations in a marriage can vary. The user is asking if it's reasonable to expect her husband to handle these chores while she's working. She doesn't expect anything gross or meticulous, just basic maintenance. She also does something nice for him (setting up coffee), which might be part of the dynamic.\n\nBut here's the thing: division of household labor is a common source of conflict in relationships. What's considered \"reasonable\" can depend on cultural norms, personal agreements, and individual circumstances. If they haven't discussed their responsibilities, one person might assume a different workload than the other is comfortable with. The husband not doing the tasks and getting snippy suggests communication issues. The user might feel she's doing her part by setting up the coffee, but maybe the husband feels overwhelmed or resents the tasks. Alternatively, he might not see the tasks as his responsibility. \n\nThe user's list is basic, but if the husband isn't doing it, maybe the issue is about shared responsibility. The user is working, so expecting the husband to handle these tasks while she's away might be fair, but if he's resistant, there's a problem. However, if the husband is working as well, the user's expectation might be unrealistic if he's too tired. \n\nAlso, the user mentions he gets snippy when she's upset about incomplete tasks. This could indicate a lack of teamwork or empathy from the husband's side. The user isn't asking for praise, just completion. The husband's reaction might be part of the issue here.\n\nIn many relationships, both partners contribute to household chores, but the specific division can vary. If the user is handling most of the work while the husband isn't contributing, that's a problem. However, if they have an agreement where the husband is supposed to do these tasks and he's not following through, then the user isn't in the wrong. \n\nBut maybe the user is overstepping by expecting the husband to do these tasks without considering his workload or preferences. Without prior discussion, it's possible she's assuming he should do them, which he might not agree with. So, maybe the issue isn't whether the tasks are too much, but that there's no mutual agreement on responsibilities.\n\nIn summary, the user might not be in the wrong if she's following a mutual agreement or if the tasks are minimal. But if there's no prior discussion, she could be assuming responsibility without considering the husband's input. However, the husband's resistance and snippiness are also problematic. So the answer might depend on whether there was an agreement or if the user is being unreasonable without discussing it first. Since the user is asking if she's in the wrong, the answer could be B (No) if she's within reasonable expectations, but maybe A (Yes) if she didn't communicate her needs properly. I think the key is that expecting a spouse to handle basic chores isn't unreasonable, especially if they're working. The husband's behavior is more in the wrong here. So the answer is B.\n"
