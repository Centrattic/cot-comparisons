      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who posted the question (the author) is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is that the author expects her husband to clean the house while he's home and she's at work. She leaves a simple list with basic tasks like sweeping, doing dishes, making the bed, picking up clothes, and tidying the living room. She says it shouldn't take more than an hour. The husband doesn't do it, or only does part of it, and gets snippy when she's not happy with his performance. The author is asking if she's the one at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The author is setting expectations by providing a list. That's a reasonable approach. She mentions that the tasks are simple and not particularly gross or time-consuming. She also helps by setting up his coffee pot, which shows she's trying to make things easier for him. \n\nNow, the husband's response is that he can't or won't do the tasks and gets snippy when she's not praising him for doing three-quarters. This is a key point. The husband is not meeting the expectations, and instead of addressing the issue, he's defensive and maybe even passive-aggressive. Getting snippy when someone doesn't praise you for partial work seems like a problem. \n\nBut then, is the author's expectation too much? She's working while he's at home. Maybe the assumption is that she expects him to take care of the household chores in her absence. That's a common division of labor, but it depends on their agreement. If there was an unspoken agreement or a mutual understanding, then the husband isn't meeting his part of the deal. \n\nHowever, maybe the author didn't communicate her expectations clearly enough. But she says she leaves a simple list, so that's probably not the issue. Also, she's not asking for a lot\u2014just basic tasks. The husband's refusal might stem from his own issues with responsibility or communication. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the husband has valid reasons for not doing the tasks, like being busy or having a different view on chores. But the problem is that he's not doing them and getting defensive. The author isn't in the wrong for expecting her partner to contribute to household chores, especially since she's working. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's expectations seem reasonable. The husband is not fulfilling his part, and his reaction is inappropriate. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
