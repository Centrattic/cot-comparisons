      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work is unreasonable.\n\nFirst, the author mentions she leaves a simple list of tasks: sweeping, dishes, making the bed, picking up clothes, and tidying the living room. She doesn't ask for anything gross or detailed. That seems pretty basic. She also sets up his coffee, which is a nice gesture. She says it should take less than an hour, which might be reasonable depending on how much work is involved.\n\nThe husband, however, can't or won't do it and gets snippy when she points out he only did part of the list. The key here is mutual expectations in a relationship. Sharing household chores is common, especially when both partners work. If the author is working and he's at home, it's fair to expect him to handle some chores while she's away. But maybe there's an imbalance? Like, perhaps she's not contributing when he's at work? Wait, she's at work when he's home. So maybe when she's home, he's at work? If that's the case, maybe the roles are split. But she's asking him to do these tasks specifically when she's not there.\n\nBut the problem is that he's not doing them and gets defensive. The author isn't being unreasonable here. She's setting clear expectations and even helping by setting up his coffee. The husband's reaction is the issue. If he's not doing the chores and gets snippy, that's a problem. The author isn't in the wrong for expecting her partner to contribute when he's at home. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The husband's behavior is the issue, not the author's expectations.\n"
