      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work and he's at home. The author has a simple list of tasks that take less than an hour. She sets up his coffee pot, which is a nice touch. The husband doesn't do all the tasks and gets snippy when she points out he only did 3/4 of them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. The author is asking her husband to do basic chores when he's at home and she's away. It's not a big list, just a few simple things. But the husband isn't doing them, and he's getting defensive or annoyed when she checks. \n\nThen, there's the dynamic between them. The author mentions she doesn't hit her knees to praise him, implying she's not being overly appreciative or submissive. She's just checking if the tasks are done. The husband's reaction is snippiness, which might indicate frustration or maybe a lack of willingness to help. \n\nI should think about common advice in relationships. Often, it's suggested that both partners should share household responsibilities. If the husband is at home, it's reasonable to expect him to handle the chores, especially when they're outlined simply. However, the author might not be communicating effectively. Maybe the husband doesn't see the tasks as his responsibility or there's an unspoken agreement that the author handles more of the chores. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If she's just asking for a basic level of cleanliness and the husband refuses or doesn't do it, the issue might be more on the husband's side. However, the way she checks his work and points out he didn't do all tasks could come off as nagging. The husband's snippiness could be a reaction to that. \n\nWait, the author is at work, so she can't do the tasks herself during the day. It's fair for her to expect help when he's home. The list is simple and manageable. The husband not doing them and being snippy when she checks might be his fault. The author isn't asking for anything unreasonable. \n\nBut maybe the husband has other responsibilities or isn't in the mood. Still, mutual respect and shared chores are important. If the author isn't nagging but just setting expectations, and the husband isn't meeting them, then the husband might be the one in the wrong. However, the author's approach could also be part of the problem. Maybe she should talk to him about why he's not doing the tasks instead of just giving a list and checking. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not if there's a better way. The key points are the simple tasks, the husband's refusal, and his snippiness. In many AITA scenarios like this, the person expecting help isn't the one in the wrong if their request is reasonable. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
