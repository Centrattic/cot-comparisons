      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author expects her husband to clean the house while she's at work and he's at home. She leaves a simple list with basic tasks, and she sets up his coffee. He doesn't do the tasks and gets snippy when she points out he didn't do all of them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is asking if she's in the wrong for expecting her husband to do these chores. The key points are: she's not asking for much, just basic cleaning that should take under an hour. She leaves a list, which is reasonable. She's not asking for anything gross or meticulous. She even sets up his coffee, which is a thoughtful gesture.\n\nThe husband's response is that he can't or won't do it and gets snippy when she's upset he didn't finish. That seems like his issue. The author is just expressing that the expectations aren't met. \n\nNow, in terms of fairness, if two people are in a relationship, especially married, sharing household responsibilities is common. Expecting a partner to contribute when you're away is reasonable. The author isn't demanding perfection; the tasks are simple. The husband's refusal and negative reaction might stem from his own unwillingness to participate, not the author's unreasonable expectations.\n\nPossible angles: Cultural norms might vary on what's expected. Some might argue that chores are a shared responsibility, others might think that if one person is working, the other should handle it. But in this case, the author isn't taking on all the chores; she's simply expecting a basic level of cooperation. The husband's behavior is the issue here\u2014being snippy and not meeting the expectations without a valid reason.\n\nAnother point is that the author is not demanding, but setting clear expectations. It's reasonable to have a list and expect it to be followed. If the husband can't do it, maybe there's a communication issue or he's not willing to help, which is on him. The author is just asking for what she's entitled to in a partnership.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband isn't fulfilling his part, and his reaction is disrespectful. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
