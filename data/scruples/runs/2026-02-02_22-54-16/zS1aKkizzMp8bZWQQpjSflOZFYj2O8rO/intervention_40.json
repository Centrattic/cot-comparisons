      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author expects her husband to clean the house while she's at work. She leaves a simple list of tasks that should take less than an hour. The husband doesn't do them and gets snippy when she points out he only did part of the list.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. The author isn't asking for a deep clean; it's just basic chores. She's setting up his coffee pot, which is a nice touch. The husband, on the other hand, isn't meeting the expectations and is getting defensive. \n\nNow, in relationships, shared responsibilities are important. If both partners are working, it's reasonable to split chores. But there's a nuance here. The author is working while the husband is at home. Maybe he's not working? Wait, the question says \"while he is at home and I am at work.\" So maybe he's staying home, perhaps a stay-at-home dad or unemployed. That could affect dynamics. If he's at home, maybe the expectation is different. But even then, basic cleanliness is usually expected.\n\nThe husband's reaction is another point. Getting snippy when she checks on the tasks suggests he's resistant or resentful. Maybe he's not being proactive. The author isn't nagging but leaving a list. The fact that he only does part of it and then gets defensive shows he's not fulfilling his part. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. She's setting clear, minimal expectations and doing her part by setting up his coffee. The husband isn't meeting his responsibilities and is reacting poorly. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
