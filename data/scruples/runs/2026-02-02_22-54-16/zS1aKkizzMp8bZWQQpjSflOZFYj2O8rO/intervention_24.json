      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she's asking if it's her fault for expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work. She leaves a simple list of tasks that shouldn't take more than an hour. She doesn't ask for anything really gross or detailed. She even sets up his coffee pot for him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's reasonable in a shared household. Both partners usually have responsibilities. If she's working, he's at home, so maybe he has the time to do the cleaning. But maybe there's an imbalance? She's giving him a list, which is specific, but he's not doing it and getting snippy when she points out he didn't do all the tasks. \n\nI wonder if she's being too demanding. The list is simple, but maybe the issue is how it's communicated. If she's expecting him to do this every day, and he's not feeling it's fair or he's not willing, that's a problem. Also, getting snippy when she checks on it might indicate a communication problem rather than the tasks themselves. \n\nBut the core question is whether she's in the wrong. If she's asking for a basic level of cleanliness that's reasonable and he's refusing, maybe she's not wrong. However, if they haven't discussed the division of chores and she's suddenly expecting him to take on this role without considering his perspective, that could be an issue. \n\nAlso, setting up the coffee pot is a nice gesture, but maybe that's her way of contributing, so she expects him to reciprocate. But if he's not willing, then it's a matter of mutual expectations. \n\nI think the key here is whether the expectations were mutual. If they had a conversation about chores and he agreed to take on these tasks, then he's not meeting his end. But if this is a new expectation and she's not considering his workload or feelings, maybe she's overstepping. \n\nThe problem is that the husband is resistant and responds negatively. That could be his issue, but the question is if the author is in the wrong. She's stating that she's not asking for much, and he's not doing it. So from her perspective, she's not wrong because she's setting clear expectations. \n\nBut maybe she needs to consider if this is realistic. Maybe he has other responsibilities or they need to split chores differently. However, since the question is about whether she's in the wrong, if she's just setting reasonable expectations that are part of shared household duties, then the answer would be B (No). But if she's being too demanding or not considering his situation enough, then A (Yes). \n\nI think leaning towards B here, as she's not asking for a lot and he's not fulfilling his part. The issue is his response, not her expectation. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
