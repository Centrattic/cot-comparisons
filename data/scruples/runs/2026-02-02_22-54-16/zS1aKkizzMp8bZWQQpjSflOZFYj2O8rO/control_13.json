      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is asking if they're at fault for expecting their husband to clean the house while he's at home and they're at work. The tasks they leave are simple: sweep floors, do dishes, make the bed, pick up dirty clothes, and tidy the living room. They mention it's a short list and shouldn't take more than an hour. The husband either can't or won't do it, and when the author points out he didn't finish all tasks, he gets snippy. The author then asks if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the expectations. The author is asking their spouse to perform basic household chores. These are common tasks that many couples split. The author even mentions they set up the coffee pot for the husband, which shows they're trying to make things easier for him. The husband, on the other hand, isn't fulfilling these tasks and reacts negatively when reminded.\n\nI wonder about the balance of responsibilities in their relationship. If the author is at work and the husband is at home, maybe the author expects him to handle chores while they're away. But maybe the husband has other responsibilities or commitments? However, the tasks listed are minimal and manageable. The husband's reaction is also problematic\u2014he gets snippy when corrected, which indicates he's not being cooperative.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author provides a list, which is a clear way to delegate tasks. If the husband is struggling with the tasks, maybe there's a miscommunication about his capabilities or willingness. The author might need to discuss this further, but the question is about fault. \n\nIs it reasonable to expect a spouse to do these chores? I think it's a common expectation in many households. The author is not asking for excessive or time-consuming tasks. The husband's unwillingness to do them and the negative reaction when pointed out suggest that he's not meeting a reasonable expectation. \n\nHowever, maybe there are underlying issues. For example, maybe the husband feels overwhelmed by other responsibilities, or there's an imbalance in other areas of the household. The author hasn't mentioned if they do other tasks or if there's a discussion about how responsibilities are divided. But based solely on the information given, the author's request seems reasonable.\n\nThe husband's behavior\u2014being snippy and not completing the tasks\u2014could indicate he's not respecting the author's needs or not taking the requests seriously. The author is not forcing him to do anything excessive; they're asking for basic cleanliness. The fact that the husband only does three out of four tasks and gets defensive when corrected suggests he's not meeting the agreed-upon responsibilities, which would place some fault on him. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is setting a reasonable expectation and the husband isn't fulfilling it, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the author's expectations are unreasonable or if there's no discussion about shared responsibilities, maybe there's a different perspective. But the tasks listed are simple and take an hour, which is manageable. \n\nIn many relationships, dividing chores is a mutual agreement. If the author is expecting their spouse to handle these tasks while they're away, it's a standard request. The husband's response indicates a lack of cooperation and possibly resentment, which is on him. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the author isn't in the wrong for having these expectations. The husband is the one not meeting them and reacting poorly. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
