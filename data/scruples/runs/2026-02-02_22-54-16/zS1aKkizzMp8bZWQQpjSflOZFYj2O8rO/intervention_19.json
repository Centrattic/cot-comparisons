I don\u2019t ask him to do anything particularly gross or meticulous and even set up his coffee pot for when he wakes up. \nIt\u2019s not a lot and should take less than an hour to accomplish. \nHe can\u2019t/won\u2019t do it and gets snippy when I don\u2019t hit my knees to praise him for only doing 3/4s. \nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work. She leaves a simple list of tasks that shouldn't take too long. The husband doesn't do them and gets snippy when she points out he only did part of it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common expectations in relationships regarding chores. It's common for partners to have different approaches to household responsibilities. The author isn't asking for much\u2014basic tasks. She even sets up his coffee, which shows she's trying to be helpful. The husband's reaction is the main issue here. Getting snippy and not completing the tasks suggests he might be resistant to sharing chores, which can be a problem in a relationship.\n\nBut maybe there's an underlying reason. Does the husband have a valid reason for not doing the chores? The post doesn't mention any. He just can't or won't, which sounds more like a lack of willingness. The author is clear about her expectations, which is reasonable. She's not demanding perfection, just a basic level of cleanliness.\n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to contribute. If one person is consistently shouldering more, that can lead to resentment. The author is trying to share the workload, which is fair. The husband's attitude is likely the bigger issue here. So, the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong. She's setting clear expectations and doing her part to support him, while he's not reciprocating.\n"
