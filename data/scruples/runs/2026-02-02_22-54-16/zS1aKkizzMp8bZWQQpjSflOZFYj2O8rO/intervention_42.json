      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work. The key points are that she leaves a simple list with basic tasks that shouldn't take long, and she even helps by setting up his coffee. The husband doesn't do the tasks and gets snippy when she points out he only did 3/4.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in a relationship. It's common for couples to share household responsibilities, but how that's managed can vary. The author isn't asking for a lot\u2014basic cleaning that's manageable in under an hour. She's also contributing by setting up the coffee, which shows some effort to make it easier for him. \n\nThe husband's reaction is the main issue here. Getting snippy when she checks on the tasks suggests he's resistant or resentful. If he's unwilling to do the tasks she's listed, even though they're minimal, that might indicate a problem in the division of labor. But is the author in the wrong for expecting this? It depends on their agreed-upon responsibilities. If there's an unspoken agreement or expectation that he should handle certain tasks, and he's not meeting it, she's not necessarily wrong for holding him accountable. \n\nHowever, if the author hasn't communicated her expectations clearly or if the tasks are beyond what's reasonable given their circumstances, that could be a point. But from the description, the tasks are simple and quick. The husband's behavior seems dismissive, which is more on him than the author. \n\nSo, the author is setting clear, reasonable expectations and the husband isn't meeting them. The author isn't being unreasonable here. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
