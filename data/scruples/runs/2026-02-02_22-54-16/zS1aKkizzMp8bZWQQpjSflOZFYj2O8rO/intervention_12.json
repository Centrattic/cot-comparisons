      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their husband to clean the house while they're at work. The author leaves a simple list of tasks that take less than an hour. The husband doesn't do them and gets snippy if they aren't all done.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. The author isn't asking for a lot\u2014basic cleaning tasks. It's reasonable to expect a partner to handle simple chores, especially when they're at home. But then there's the part about the husband not doing them and getting annoyed. \n\nIs it fair to expect the husband to handle these tasks? Well, in a balanced relationship, both partners should contribute. The author is setting clear expectations with a list, which is helpful. The husband's reaction is problematic because he's snippy when tasks are incomplete. \n\nThe author isn't asking for praise, just completion of the tasks. The husband's resistance and attitude might be the issue here. The author's request seems reasonable, so they might not be in the wrong. But maybe I should check if the husband has any valid reasons not to do the tasks. However, the scenario doesn't mention any disabilities or constraints. \n\nSo, the answer probably leans towards B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The key points are the reasonable task list and the husband's negative reaction. The author is just asking for a basic level of household maintenance, which is typical in shared living situations.\n"
