      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author expects her husband to clean the house while she's at work. She leaves a simple list of tasks that should take less than an hour. The husband doesn't do them, does only part, and gets snippy when she's not happy about it. The author wants to know if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. The author sets up a reasonable list and even helps by setting up his coffee. She's not asking for anything overly demanding. The husband's response is negative when she points out he didn't complete the tasks. \n\nIn relationships, sharing household responsibilities is common. If both partners agree on a division of labor, then it's fair. The problem here might be that the husband isn't fulfilling his part as agreed. The key points are communication and mutual expectations. If the author discussed this with her husband beforehand and he agreed, then expecting him to follow through is reasonable. However, if he didn't agree to these tasks or they weren't communicated clearly, maybe there's room for the author to adjust.\n\nThe husband's reaction\u2014getting snippy\u2014suggests he might be resistant to taking on the tasks. That could indicate he's not on board with the arrangement. The author might be in the right if they had a mutual understanding, but if there was no prior agreement, the situation is different. However, since she's left a list, it seems she's communicated her expectations.\n\nAnother angle is the fairness of the tasks. They are simple and time-efficient, so expecting someone to do them isn't unreasonable. The husband's inability or unwillingness to do them might stem from his own issues, not the author's expectations. The author isn't asking for praise, just completion of tasks. His snippiness is his problem, not hers.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because she's setting clear, reasonable expectations and the husband isn't meeting them. The issue lies with his behavior and lack of cooperation, not her request for help. So the answer should be B.\n"
