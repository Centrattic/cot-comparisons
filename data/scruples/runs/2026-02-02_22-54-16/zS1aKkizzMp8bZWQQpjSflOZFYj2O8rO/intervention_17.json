      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she expects her husband to clean the house while he's at home, and she leaves a simple list. The tasks are basic: sweep floors, do dishes, make the bed, pick up clothes, and tidy the living room. She doesn't ask for anything too messy or detailed. She even sets up his coffee pot in the morning. She thinks it's not a lot and should take less than an hour. The husband either can't or won't do it, and he gets snippy when she points out he didn't finish all the tasks. \n\nFirst, I need to consider expectations in a marriage. Are chores typically shared responsibilities? I think in many relationships, people do split chores, but it can vary based on cultural norms, individual circumstances, and agreements between partners. The author is asking if she's at fault for expecting her husband to do these tasks while she's away.\n\nShe mentions that she leaves a list, so she's being clear about what's expected. The tasks are simple and not excessive. She also does something for him (setting up his coffee), which might be an effort to show she's contributing as well. The husband's reaction is getting snippy when she points out he didn't finish everything. That seems like a problem. If he's not doing the tasks he agreed to, and then gets defensive, maybe he's not meeting his part of the agreement.\n\nBut maybe the issue is how the expectations were communicated. Did they have a prior agreement about splitting chores? If the husband didn't agree to this setup, then the author might be imposing her expectations. However, the author doesn't mention that there was a specific agreement; she just states her expectations. \n\nAlso, the time aspect is a factor. She says it should take less than an hour. If he's at home, maybe he has other responsibilities or isn't able to fit it in. But if the tasks are that quick, maybe it's reasonable. The husband's reluctance could stem from other issues, like not valuing the tasks or not wanting to share the workload. \n\nAnother angle is the emotional response. The husband gets snippy when she checks on the progress. That could indicate a communication problem. Instead of addressing the tasks, he's getting defensive, which isn't helpful. The author is trying to hold him accountable for his part, which seems fair if there was an agreement or if she's contributing as well. \n\nI think the key points are whether there was an agreement, how the tasks are being handled, and the husband's behavior. Since the author is setting clear expectations and contributing herself (coffee setup), it's reasonable for her to expect cooperation. The husband's resistance and negative reaction might be the main issues here. \n\nSo, based on this, the author doesn't seem to be in the wrong. The husband is not meeting the expectations and reacting poorly, which points to his behavior being the problem. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
