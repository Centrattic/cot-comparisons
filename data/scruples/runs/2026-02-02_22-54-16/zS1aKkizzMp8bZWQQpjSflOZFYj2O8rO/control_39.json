      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the question is whether it's acceptable for her to expect her husband to clean the house while she's at work and he's at home. She leaves a simple list of tasks that aren't too demanding. She mentions that he doesn't do them and gets snippy when she points out he only did part of it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's reasonable in a relationship. Both partners often share household chores, so maybe it's fair for her to expect her husband to contribute. The tasks listed are basic and not overly time-consuming. The husband has the time since he's at home, whereas she's at work. It's a trade-off where she's working outside the home, and he's handling the house when he's there.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more context. Does the husband have other responsibilities? If he's working from home, maybe he's handling his job, but she's asking for minimal tasks. The key here is the expectation and mutual agreement. If they haven't discussed or agreed on chore responsibilities, that could be an issue. Relationships usually require communication. However, the author set up a list, which shows she's tried to make it clear and simple. \n\nHe gets snippy when she points out he didn't finish 100%. That could indicate a problem in how he's responding, but also maybe about the expectations. If the tasks are reasonable and he's avoiding them, that might be his fault. On the other hand, if the author hasn't communicated her needs clearly or if the division of labor isn't balanced, that could be her part. However, she mentions she leaves a list and sets up his coffee, which is kind. The tasks are minimal. It's not about asking for perfection but basic tidiness. \n\nAnother angle: cultural or traditional roles might influence this. If she's taking on more at work and expects him to handle the house, that could be a fair arrangement. The problem is his resistance and the snippiness. The author isn't being unreasonable here. The husband's response is what's problematic. The author is just asking for what she's outlined, and the husband isn't meeting that. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for having this expectation. The husband's behavior is the issue here. They need to communicate better, but the initial expectation is reasonable. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
