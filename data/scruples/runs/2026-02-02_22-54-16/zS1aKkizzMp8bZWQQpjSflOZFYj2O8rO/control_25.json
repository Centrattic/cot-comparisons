      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation (AITA) is at fault.\n\nThe author's husband is supposed to clean the house while he's at home and she's at work. She leaves a simple list with basic tasks like sweeping, doing dishes, making the bed, picking up clothes, and tidying the living room. She mentions it should take less than an hour and that she doesn't ask for anything gross or meticulous. She even sets up his coffee pot. But he doesn't do all of it and gets snippy when she points out he only did part of the list. She's asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider expectations in a marriage regarding chores. It's common for couples to share household responsibilities. The author is setting clear expectations with a list, which is reasonable. The tasks are basic and not excessive. She's not asking for perfection, just completion. The husband's reaction seems to indicate he's not meeting expectations and is defensive or uncooperative. \n\nBut wait, maybe she's being too demanding? If he's at home and she's working, it's fair to expect some contribution. However, the husband's resistance and the snippiness when confronted might point to communication issues or a lack of willingness on his part. \n\nAnother angle: maybe she's not considering his workload or other responsibilities. But she says the tasks are simple and take less than an hour. There's no mention of him having other tasks. Also, she's setting up the coffee pot, which is helpful and shows she's contributing as well. \n\nThe key here is whether the expectations are reasonable. The tasks are minimal, and she's providing a list to make it easy. The husband's refusal or inability to complete them without conflict suggests he's not meeting his part of the agreement. \n\nHowever, maybe the issue is communication. Perhaps the husband feels overwhelmed or there's an underlying issue not mentioned. But based on the information given, the husband isn't fulfilling his part, and the author is holding him accountable for his responsibilities. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if both parties are contributing, then it's balanced. The author is contributing by setting up the coffee and having a clear list. The husband isn't doing his part. So the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
