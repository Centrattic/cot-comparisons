      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work. The situation is that she leaves a simple cleaning list for him, and he doesn't do it all, gets snippy, and she's upset about that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations here. The author is asking if it's \"too much\" to expect her husband to do these basic tasks. The tasks listed are sweeping floors, doing dishes, making the bed, picking up clothes, and tidying the living room. These are basic household chores. Setting up the coffee pot is a nice touch, showing she's trying to make it easier for him.\n\nNow, the husband isn't doing the tasks and gets snippy when she points out he didn't complete them. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate if the author's expectations are reasonable. \n\nIn many relationships, splitting chores is common. If both partners work, they often share responsibilities. The author is setting clear, simple tasks. The husband's refusal to do them and the negative reaction might indicate a lack of willingness to contribute equally. The author isn't asking for anything excessive, so she's not overstepping. The issue seems to be the husband's behavior rather than the author's expectations. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
