      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author expects her husband to clean the house while she's at work. She leaves a simple list of tasks that should take less than an hour. The husband either can't or won't do it and gets snippy when she's not happy with him doing only 3/4 of the tasks. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is setting clear expectations with a to-do list. She's not asking for anything excessive, just basic cleaning tasks. She even helps by setting up his coffee. The husband, on the other hand, isn't meeting these expectations and reacts negatively when she points out he didn't finish all tasks. \n\nIn relationships, shared responsibilities are common. If both partners are working, it's reasonable to split household chores. The author isn't demanding perfection, just the basics. The husband's reaction of getting snippy suggests he might not be taking it seriously or is resistant to contributing. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a communication issue. The author leaves a list, which is a good start, but the husband's resistance could be due to unspoken reasons. Maybe he's overwhelmed, doesn't see the tasks as important, or there's an imbalance in other areas. But according to the given info, the tasks are minimal and take less than an hour. The husband's refusal without valid reason seems like his issue, not the author's. \n\nThe key points are: clear expectations, reasonable tasks, and the husband's failure to meet them with negative reactions. The author isn't being unreasonable here. So, the answer is likely B (No, she's not in the wrong). But I should check if there's any nuance I'm missing. For example, maybe the husband has a valid reason not to do it, but the post doesn't mention that. Since the question is based only on the provided text, the answer remains B.\n"
