      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their husband to clean the house while they're at work. The author provides a simple list of tasks that should take under an hour. They mention not asking for anything gross or meticulous and even set up the coffee pot. The husband doesn't do the tasks and gets snippy when not all is done.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is working, so they can't do the cleaning themselves during the day. They left a clear list, which is reasonable. The tasks are basic and not excessive. The husband's reaction is negative when only part of the list is done. \n\nIn relationships, expectations can vary. Some couples split chores equally, others take turns. The key here is whether the expectation is unreasonable. The author isn't demanding perfection; just basic cleanliness. The husband's refusal and snippiness might indicate a lack of willingness to share household responsibilities, which is a common issue in many relationships. \n\nI should also consider cultural and personal factors. Maybe the husband has different views on chores or their importance. However, the author is asking if they're in the wrong, not seeking advice on how to resolve it. The core question is about right or wrong. \n\nSince the author is asking for an evaluation, the answer depends on societal norms and fairness. Expecting a partner to contribute to household tasks is generally considered fair. The husband's behavior\u2014refusing and getting snippy\u2014is problematic. The author isn't wrong for setting a reasonable expectation. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
