      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a wife expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work, but he doesn't do it and gets snippy when she's not happy with his effort.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author mentions she leaves a simple list of tasks that shouldn't take more than an hour. She's setting up his coffee pot, which is a nice touch, but he's not doing the cleaning and gets snippy when she points out he didn't complete all the tasks. \n\nSo, the main question is about expectations in a marriage regarding household chores. The author isn't asking for much\u2014basic tasks that are manageable. The husband's response is negative; he's not fulfilling his part and is being snippy. \n\nI should consider the balance in partnerships. Both partners usually share household responsibilities, so expecting the husband to do his share isn't unreasonable. The fact that the tasks are simple and the time needed is minimal supports the author's side. \n\nThe husband's reaction\u2014getting snippy\u2014suggests a lack of cooperation and maybe resentment. If he's unwilling to do the tasks and gets defensive, that's a problem. The author isn't forcing him but is asking for a reasonable contribution. \n\nAnother angle: communication. The author leaves a list, which is clear. The husband's not completing tasks and getting annoyed points to a failure in communication or unwillingness on his part. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the husband has other responsibilities or the author's expectations are too high. But the tasks listed are basic and quick. Also, the author is setting up the coffee pot, showing she's trying to be helpful. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the expectations are reasonable and if there's mutual respect. Here, the author's expectations seem fair, and the husband's behavior is dismissive. So the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
