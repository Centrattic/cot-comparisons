      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for expecting their husband to clean the house while they're at work.\n\nFirst, the wife has a list of simple chores. She leaves a list with basic tasks like sweeping, dishes, making the bed, picking up clothes, and tidying the living room. She also sets up his coffee pot. So she's trying to make it easy for him by being specific and even doing a small task for him.\n\nShe mentions that the tasks take less than an hour. The husband isn't doing them and gets snippy when she points out he hasn't done all the tasks. The key points here are her expectations versus his willingness to comply. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Expecting a partner to help with chores is generally reasonable, especially when the partner is at home. However, it might depend on the context\u2014like if there's an agreement about chores, or if the husband has other responsibilities. But from the given info, the wife's request seems minimal. She's not asking for anything gross or time-consuming. The husband's reaction (getting snippy) suggests he's being defensive or resistant.\n\nIn many relationships, splitting chores is a shared responsibility. If she's working and he's home, it's fair to expect him to handle some tasks. The fact that she's even setting up his coffee shows she's making an effort, and if he's not reciprocating, that could be an issue. However, the husband's unwillingness to do the chores and the attitude might be the problem here. \n\nBut maybe there's an underlying issue. Maybe he has other responsibilities or different views on household duties. However, the information provided doesn't indicate that. The wife's list is simple, and the husband's refusal seems like the main issue. \n\nSo, considering all this, the wife isn't unreasonable. The husband is not meeting her expectations, which is leading to conflict. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
