      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author expects their husband to clean the house while he's home and she's at work. The tasks are simple: sweep floors, do dishes, make the bed, pick up clothes, tidy the living room. She leaves a list and even sets up his coffee. The husband doesn't do it all, maybe three out of four, and gets snippy when she isn't happy about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's reasonable in a marriage regarding household chores. Both partners usually share responsibilities. If the author is working, it's fair to expect her husband to contribute. The tasks listed are basic and not overly time-consuming. The author isn't asking for much, just a simple list. The husband's resistance and getting snippy when she points out he didn't finish seems like a problem. \n\nBut maybe the husband has a different view. Maybe he feels overburdened, or the expectations aren't discussed properly. However, the author left a list, so she did communicate her expectations. The husband's response is negative, which could indicate a lack of willingness to contribute. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for expecting her husband to do these tasks? Probably not. It's a reasonable expectation for a shared responsibility. The husband's behavior (snippiness) is more indicative of where the issue lies. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
