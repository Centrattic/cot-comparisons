      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the question is whether expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work is unreasonable. The author mentions that she leaves a simple list with basic tasks like sweeping, dishes, making the bed, picking up clothes, and tidying the living room. She also sets up his coffee pot. She says it shouldn't take an hour and he either can't or won't do it, and gets snippy when she's not happy with his partial effort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common expectations in a relationship. Many couples split household chores, but the specifics can vary. The author is asking if it's too much to expect her husband to do these tasks. The tasks listed seem reasonable and not overly demanding. Making the bed and doing dishes are pretty standard. The fact that she provides a list might help, so he knows exactly what's needed. Setting up the coffee pot shows she's trying to make it easier for him, which is a nice gesture.\n\nNow, the husband not doing the tasks and getting snippy when he only completes part of the list suggests that there's a problem. If the tasks are simple and quick, his refusal or inability could be an issue of unwillingness. However, maybe there are other factors. For example, does he have other responsibilities or health issues? The author doesn't mention that, so maybe we can assume he's capable.\n\nThe key points here are mutual expectations. If both parties agreed on a division of chores, then expecting him to do his part is reasonable. If there's no such agreement, the author might be setting an expectation without discussing it. However, even if they didn't explicitly agree, it's common for couples to share household duties. The fact that the author is working while he's at home might imply that they can split the chores when one is away.\n\nThe husband's reaction (getting snippy) might indicate a lack of appreciation for her efforts. The author isn't demanding perfection or anything extreme. The tasks are minimal, so her expectations seem fair. It's possible that the husband is resistant to taking on any chores, which could be a matter of attitude rather than the tasks themselves.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the author's actions don't seem unreasonable. She's asking for a basic level of household maintenance, which is typical in many relationships. The husband's refusal and negative reaction are problematic. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. So the answer would be B.\n"
