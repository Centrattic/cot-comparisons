For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. The situation involves a 17-year-old brother who became a father, and there are issues with neglect and the baby momma dropping the kid off to get back at him. The parents are taking over, and the brother isn't helping. The author reported to CPS, leading to family tension.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal and ethical aspects. Child Protective Services steps in when there's neglect or abuse. The brother is 17, which in many places makes him a minor parent. If he's neglecting the child\u2014like leaving her unattended, allowing swearing around her, injuries\u2014those are valid concerns. The ex is also involved in harmful behavior. \n\nThe author's intent was to protect the child, which is a valid concern. However, reporting family matters can be sensitive. The brother is a minor, but in some states, parents can have custody of minor parents' children. The author's actions might be justified if there's actual neglect. But was there enough evidence? The user mentions specific incidents like injuries from being left alone, which are red flags. \n\nEthically, the duty to protect a child overrides family loyalty. Even if the brother is upset, the child's safety is paramount. The author might be in the right by acting in the child's best interest. However, maybe there were other steps first, like counseling or family intervention. But given the severity of the neglect described, CPS involvement is appropriate. \n\nThe answer should consider whether the child's safety was compromised and if the report was justified. Since the child is being harmed, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B (Not in the wrong) seems correct.\n"
