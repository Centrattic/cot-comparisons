For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation involves the brother being a teen parent, having a breakup with the baby's mother, and both parents neglecting the child. The author saw neglect like swearing in front of the kid, leaving her unattended, injuries, and the parents using the child as a weapon. The author reported it to CPS, which caused family tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, mandatory reporters (like teachers, doctors) have to report suspected child abuse or neglect. But here, the author is a family member. However, even non-mandatory reporters can report if they suspect harm. The key is whether the neglect actually exists. The author describes specific incidents that could be considered neglect, like leaving the child unattended, injuries, and exposure to swearing. Those are valid concerns.\n\nNext, the moral aspect. The author's decision is based on protecting the child's welfare. Even if the brother is a family member, the child's safety is paramount. The brother isn't fulfilling his duties, and the parents are taking over. The author's silence might have allowed continued harm. Reporting is a responsible action in this case.\n\nFamily conflict is a consequence, but the primary duty is to the child. The author didn't act out of malice but concern. CPS involvement is justified here. So, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
