For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation involves a 17-year-old brother who became a father and is now neglecting the child, with the mother also behaving irresponsibly. The author reports the neglect, leading to CPS involvement, and the brother is upset, thinking their dad did it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, mandatory reporting laws require anyone who suspects child abuse or neglect to report it. So legally, the author might be doing the right thing. Ethically, it's about protecting the child from harm. The neglect described\u2014leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, injuries\u2014could be considered neglectful behavior.\n\nHowever, the brother's age and the circumstances might factor in. He's 17 and dealing with a breakup, which could contribute to his instability. But the child's well-being is paramount. The author's decision to report might be seen as necessary to ensure the child is safe, even if it causes family conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should have tried to resolve the issue within the family first or supported the brother without reporting. But given the severity of the neglect described, it's possible that the author had a duty to act. Also, the brother's denial and the ongoing conflict might indicate that internal solutions aren't working.\n\nThe answer should be whether the author is in the wrong. Since the situation involves potential child neglect and the author took action to protect the child, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). There's no indication that the report was malicious. The key factors are the child's safety and the legal obligation to report.\n"
