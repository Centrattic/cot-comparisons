For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to child protective services. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author's younger brother had a child at 17, and things went south after a breakup. The mother and brother are using the child as a weapon against each other. The mother drops off the kid to get back at the brother, and the brother isn't helping around the house. They're both neglecting the child by swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, and she's getting injured. The parents now take care of most of the child's needs. The author, after talking to their dad, reported the incidents to CPS, which caused conflict because the brother thinks the dad did it.\n\nFirst, I should consider legal and ethical responsibilities. In many places, you're a mandated reporter if you suspect child neglect or abuse, even if you're not a parent. The author might have felt a duty to protect the child. The neglect described\u2014leaving the kid alone, swearing, injuries\u2014could be serious enough to warrant a report.\n\nBut then, the brother is a minor himself (17 when the child was born, so maybe around 19-21 now?), so is he considered a minor parent? If the child is under 18 months, the brother is still a teenager. CPS might step in more easily in cases where the parent is underage and unable to provide adequate care.\n\nThe author's motivations matter. They might be trying to protect the child, which is a selfless act. However, the brother might feel betrayed by the report. Family dynamics can be complex here. But the child's safety is the priority. If the neglect is real and ongoing, the author's action could be justified.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author didn't try enough to help the brother first, like offering support or counseling instead of immediately reporting. But if the brother isn't responsive and the neglect is clear, the author might not be in the wrong for taking action.\n\nAlso, the brother's reaction is causing family issues, but that's a consequence of the action, not necessarily a reflection on whether the action was right. The key is whether the child is at risk. If the author believed in good faith that there was neglect, they might be in the right.\n\nSo considering all factors, the answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
