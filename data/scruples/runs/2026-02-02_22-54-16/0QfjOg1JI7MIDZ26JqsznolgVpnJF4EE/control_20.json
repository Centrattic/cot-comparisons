For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation involves a 17-year-old brother who has a child with a girl, and after a breakup, both he and the mother are neglecting the child. The brother isn't helping, the mother is dropping off the kid to annoy him, and the child is being exposed to swearing, left unattended, and injured. The parents are stepping in, but the brother isn't contributing. The person in question reported this to CPS, and now there's family conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Reporting suspected child neglect is usually a legal obligation in many places. CPS exists to protect children, so if there's credible evidence of neglect, reporting is the right thing to do. The brother is a minor (17) when he had the child, which might affect his ability to care for the child adequately. The mother's behavior is also harmful. The child's safety and well-being are paramount here.\n\nThe person's actions were to prevent further harm to the child. Even if the brother is a family member, the duty to protect the child takes precedence. The brother's reaction is negative, but that doesn't make the reporter wrong. The alternative is staying silent and letting the child suffer, which would be neglecting their responsibility. Also, the reporter didn't disclose their identity, which is understandable to avoid family conflict, but not necessary to determine if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They acted to protect the child. The brother might be upset, but the child's welfare is more important. There's no indication that the reporter acted out of malice or without justification. The neglect described is significant enough to warrant intervention.\n"
