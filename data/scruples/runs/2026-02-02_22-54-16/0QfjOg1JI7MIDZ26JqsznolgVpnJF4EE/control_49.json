For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about their younger brother becoming a father at 17, and then not handling it well. The brother and the mother of the child are in a bad situation where they're using the kid against each other. The author reports them to CPS because they're neglecting the child, like leaving her unattended, not watching her enough, and she's getting injured. The parents are now taking over most of the childcare, and the brother is not helping. The baby mom is also using the child for Instagram and causing trouble.\n\nThe author is getting blamed by their brother, who thinks their dad reported them. They're wondering if they're the asshole for reporting and for not coming forward. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Child Protective Services (CPS) is there to protect children from neglect and abuse. If there are credible reports of neglect, like leaving a young child unattended, not supervising leading to injuries, and exposure to swearing, that's a valid reason to report. The author's actions might be justified if they believed the child was in danger.\n\nOn the other hand, family dynamics can be complex. Reporting can cause a rift in the family, but the primary responsibility is the child's safety. The brother is 17, which is a legal minor in some places, but if he's an adult (depending on the jurisdiction), the legal obligations might be different. However, neglect is a serious issue regardless of the parents' age.\n\nThe author's decision to stay quiet about being the reporter might be seen as avoiding conflict, but if the child is in danger, the right thing is to ensure the report was valid. CPS can investigate and determine if there's actual neglect. The author isn't obligated to reveal themselves unless required, but they might be doing it to maintain family peace, which could be seen as a good or bad thing depending on the situation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's intent was to protect the child, which is a good cause. The actions align with the duty to protect children from harm. Therefore, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
