For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. The situation is that the brother had a child at 17, and there's a lot of conflict with the mother. They both neglect the child, like leaving her unattended, swearing in front of her, and the kid has gotten injured. The parents are stepping in, and the author reported it. Now the brother is upset, thinking the dad did it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, mandated reporters are required to report suspected child abuse or neglect. Even if you're not a professional, like a family member, you can still report anonymously. The author's actions are likely within their rights because they're trying to protect a child in danger.\n\nNext, the moral aspect. The child's safety is the priority. The brother and the mother are not providing proper care, using the child as leverage. The author is stepping in to prevent harm, which is a responsible action. The brother's reaction is understandable but not the point if the child is at risk.\n\nNow, possible counterarguments: some might say it's a family matter and should be handled internally. But when there's neglect and potential harm, it's not just a family issue anymore. The author isn't interfering just out of spite; they're addressing actual neglect. The brother might feel betrayed, but the child's well-being is more critical.\n\nAlso, the author didn't disclose their identity, which is common in CPS cases to protect the reporter. The brother's anger is directed at the family, but the author's action was necessary. The key here is the child's safety versus family tension. The author isn't at fault here.\n"
