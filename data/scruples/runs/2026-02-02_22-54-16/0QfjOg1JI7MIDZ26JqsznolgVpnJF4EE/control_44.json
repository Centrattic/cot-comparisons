For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation involves the brother having a child at 17, then a breakup leading to neglect and conflict with the baby's mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The brother is neglecting the child in various ways: swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, not preventing injuries, and not contributing to her care. The mother also seems to be using the child as a weapon in their disputes. The parents have taken over, but the brother isn't helping. The person reporting is an older sibling, maybe also a parent? They decided to report to CPS, which led to CPS involvement and family conflict.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key issue here is child neglect. If there's evidence of neglect, then reporting to CPS is actually a responsible action. CPS exists to protect children from harm. The brother is a minor parent (17) which might complicate things, but the child's safety is paramount. The sister's decision to report is based on observed neglect and the mother's harmful behavior. \n\nHowever, the brother is upset, thinking the father did it. The sister didn't come forward, which might add to the family tension. But the main question is about the rightness of reporting. Legally and ethically, if someone knows a child is being neglected, they have a duty to report it. Even if it causes family issues, the child's welfare is more important. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the sister could have tried to help the brother first before reporting. But given the ongoing neglect and the brother's lack of action, waiting might not be in the child's best interest. Also, the mother's behavior (stalking, dropping off the child) adds to the neglectful environment. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the sister acted to protect the child from neglect, which is a valid reason. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
