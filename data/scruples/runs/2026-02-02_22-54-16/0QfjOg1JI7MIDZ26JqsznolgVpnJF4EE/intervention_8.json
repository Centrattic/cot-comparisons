For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. Let me start by reading through the details carefully.\n\nThe situation involves the author's younger brother who had a child at 17. The brother and the mother are in a bitter split, and they're using the child as a weapon against each other. The mother drops off the kid unexpectedly, and there's neglect happening\u2014like leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, injuries from not being watched properly. The parents are now taking over most of the parenting duties, while the brother isn't contributing. The author reported this to CPS, which caused tension in the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In the US, reporting suspected child abuse or neglect to Child Protective Services is a legal obligation for mandatory reporters, but anyone can report if they have concerns. The author is a family member, so they might not be a mandatory reporter, but they still have the right and responsibility to report if they believe a child is in danger.\n\nThe key here is whether the author had reasonable cause to believe the child was being neglected. The incidents described\u2014leaving the child unattended, injuries, exposure to swearing\u2014could be signs of neglect. CPS does investigate these types of reports, even if they turn out to be false, as it's better to check than risk a child's safety.\n\nThe author's brother is upset because he feels betrayed, especially since the parents didn't tell him the author was the one who reported. But the author's motivation seems to be protecting the child, which is a valid concern. The brother's inaction in parenting and the mother's behavior contribute to the neglect. The author might be seen as taking a stand for the child's well-being, even if it causes family conflict.\n\nHowever, the author should consider if there were other steps they could have taken first, like trying to mediate or involve other family members or community resources before reporting. But given the severity of the neglect (injuries, consistent neglect of supervision), immediate action might be necessary. CPS is the appropriate authority in such cases.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on the justification of their actions. If they genuinely believed the child was in danger, their report was justified. The brother's reaction is understandable, but the author isn't obligated to stay quiet if a child is at risk. Also, staying silent could be complicit in neglect. The author's choice to report isn't malicious; it's protective.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. They acted to protect a vulnerable child, which is a moral and legal duty. The family dynamics are complicated, but the primary concern is the child's safety. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
