For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported their 17-year-old brother to Child Protective Services (CPS) is in the wrong. The situation describes the brother and the baby's mother both being neglectful and using the child as leverage in their bitter relationship. The brother isn't helping, the mother drops off the child unannounced, and both are neglecting the 16-month-old.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, child neglect is a serious matter, and if a child is being harmed, even if it's not extreme, reporting to CPS is a responsible action. The question is whether the author overstepped by reporting their own family member. The key points here are the presence of neglect: swearing in front of the child, leaving her unattended, injuries from not supervision, and the parents taking over. The brother is 17, so maybe a minor in some states, but since he has a child, he's a legal guardian. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is an asshole (ITA) for reporting. The answer hinges on whether the reporting was justified. If the brother is indeed neglecting the child, then the author is doing the right thing to protect the child. However, if there's no evidence of harm beyond what's typical for a stressful situation, or if the author acted recklessly without proper cause, then maybe. But the scenario mentions the child has been injured due to lack of supervision, which is a red flag. Leaving a child in a playpen for hours unsupervised could be considered neglect. The mother's behavior also suggests instability, which adds to the child's risk.\n\nEthically, the author's duty is to the child's well-being. Even if it causes family conflict, neglecting a child is a serious issue. The brother's reaction of blaming the family (specifically dad) and causing problems might be part of the fallout, but the main concern is the child's safety. The author might have felt a responsibility to act when their parents were already involved. \n\nPossible counterarguments: The brother is a teenager and might be struggling, and the author could have tried to mediate first. But in cases of child neglect, the law typically requires reporting rather than waiting to see if someone else can handle it. The author might have a moral obligation to intervene if they believe it's in the child's best interest.\n\nSo, the answer here is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They took action to protect a child from neglect, which is a valid and responsible step. However, there might be nuances depending on local laws and the specific circumstances, but based on the information given, reporting neglect is justified.\n"
