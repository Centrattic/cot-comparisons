For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to child protective services (CPS). The situation involves the brother, who was 17 when he had a child, and both he and the mother are neglecting the daughter. The author reported the neglect to CPS, leading to intervention, and now the brother is upset, blaming the family.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from a moral and legal perspective. The key points here are the neglect of a child. The brother and ex-girlfriend are leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, and using her as a tool in their disputes. The parents are taking over, but the brother isn't helping. The author, concerned about the child's well-being, reported it to CPS.\n\nLegally, in many places, people are mandated reporters if they suspect child abuse or neglect. Even if not a mandated reporter, there's a legal obligation in some jurisdictions to report suspected child endangerment. So the author might be acting within the law.\n\nMorally, the author's intent was to protect the child. The brother's actions are neglectful, and the author saw the child in a harmful environment. Reporting to CPS is a way to ensure the child's safety, even if it causes family conflict. The brother's reaction, while hurtful, might be a consequence of his own actions.\n\nHowever, there's a possible counter-argument that the author should have tried to resolve the issue within the family first, or maybe the situation wasn't severe enough for CPS. But given the description\u2014leaving the child unattended, injuries, and using the child as leverage\u2014it seems like neglect. The author might not be in the wrong for taking action to protect the child.\n\nSo the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
