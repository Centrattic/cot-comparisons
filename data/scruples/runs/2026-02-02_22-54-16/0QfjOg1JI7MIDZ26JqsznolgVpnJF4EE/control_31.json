For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to child protective services. The situation involves the brother having a child at 17, a messy breakup, and both parents neglecting the child. The author reported it, and now the brother is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, if someone has reasonable cause to believe a child is being neglected or abused, they have a legal duty to report it. The author mentions specific instances like leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, and injuries. These could be signs of neglect.\n\nBut then, family dynamics matter. The brother is a minor (17) himself, which complicates things. CPS might handle cases differently with a minor parent. The author's parents are stepping in, but maybe there's a conflict here. The brother might feel his rights are being violated even if the actions are neglectful.\n\nAlso, the author didn't reveal themselves as the reporter. That could be a point of contention. Was it necessary to stay anonymous, or should they have communicated with the family first? However, staying silent might mean the child continues to be at risk.\n\nThe key here is whether the neglect is significant. Leaving a 16-month-old in a playpen while playing games for hours\u2014could be neglectful if it's a pattern. The injuries also indicate possible neglect. The author's intent was to protect the child, which is a noble cause. But the brother's reaction is understandable, feeling betrayed by a family member.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, mandatory reporters (like teachers, doctors) must report, but even non-mandatory individuals can report if they suspect harm. The author is not a mandatory reporter, but they still chose to report. That's allowed. The question is whether their actions were justified.\n\nConsidering the child's safety is paramount. If there's credible evidence of neglect, the author is acting in the child's best interest. However, the brother is a minor, which might mean the system has different protocols. But the child's safety shouldn't be compromised just because the parent is young.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are legally justified if there's sufficient reason to report. The decision to report, even anonymously, is about protecting the child. While the brother is upset, the author isn't in the wrong if the neglect is real. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
