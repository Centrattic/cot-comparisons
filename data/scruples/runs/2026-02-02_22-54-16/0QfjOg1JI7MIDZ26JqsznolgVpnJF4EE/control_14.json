For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the user reported their 17-year-old brother to Child Protective Services (CPS) because they observed neglect towards his child. The brother had a child with an unstable girl, and both parents are behaving poorly, using the child as a weapon in their bitter breakup. The neglect includes swearing in front of the toddler, leaving her unattended, injuries from not supervision, and the brother not helping at home. The user's parents have taken over parenting, and the brother is upset because he thinks the dad reported him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, reporting suspected child abuse or neglect is not just a right but a legal duty. If someone believes a child is in danger, they can report it anonymously. The user's actions were to protect the child from neglect and potential harm. Even if the brother is a parent, if he's a minor (17) and the situation is neglectful, CPS involvement might be necessary.\n\nThen, consider the consequences. The brother is upset, but the primary concern is the child's safety. The neglect described\u2014leaving a 16-month-old unattended, injuries, lack of supervision\u2014could be considered neglectful. The user's parents are stepping in, but maybe they aren't legally responsible, so CPS involvement is appropriate.\n\nAlso, the user's decision to stay quiet about being the reporter might be seen as a strategic move to avoid family conflict, which isn't inherently wrong if it protects the child. However, if the brother is being falsely accused, the reporter's identity should be protected, but in this case, the user had valid reasons.\n\nIn ethical terms, the greater good is protecting the child. The user isn't the one neglecting the child; they're trying to intervene. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, some might argue that the user overstepped by involving CPS without exhausting other options, like talking to the parents or the mother first. But given the severity of the neglect and the brother's age (still a minor in some states), reporting is likely justified. So, the correct answer is B.\n"
