For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. \n\nFirst, the situation: the brother had a kid with an unstable girl when he was 17. They're both not handling parenting well. They fight a lot and use the child against each other. The mom drops the kid off to get back at the brother, and he's neglecting her by leaving her alone while gaming. The parents are stepping in, and the brother isn't helping. The sister reports them to CPS.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the sister was right to report. The brother is 17, but he's a parent now. The daughter is 16 months old, so she's young. The neglect described includes leaving her unattended, swearing in front of her, and she's injured. The sister is concerned for the child's safety and well-being. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in the US, any person can report suspected child abuse or neglect to CPS. The duty to report exists for certain professionals, but there's no legal obligation for others. However, in many states, you're allowed to report anonymous. The sister did report, and now the brother is upset because he thought the dad did it. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the sister's intent was to protect the child. The brother's actions (and the mother's) are putting the child at risk. CPS is there to intervene when there's neglect or abuse. The sister might be seen as trying to help, even if it caused family conflict. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she shouldn't have meddled in family matters, but the key here is the child's safety. If there's actual neglect, reporting is the responsible thing. The brother's reaction is about family tension, not the child's welfare. \n\nSo, based on the information, the sister's action seems justified to protect the child. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
