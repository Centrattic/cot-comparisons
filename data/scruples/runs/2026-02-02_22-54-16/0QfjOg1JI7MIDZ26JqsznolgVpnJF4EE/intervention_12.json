For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation involves their younger brother, who became a parent at 17 and is now struggling with a broken relationship with the child's mother. They both seem to be neglecting the child, arguing, and using the daughter as a way to get back at each other. The brother isn't helping much, and the parents are stepping in. The author reported this to CPS, which caused tension in the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects. In many places, there are mandatory reporting laws that require individuals to report suspected child abuse or neglect. If the author witnessed neglect, like leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, and injuries, then reporting it might be not only their right but their duty. The brother's reaction could be due to feeling betrayed, but the safety of the child is a higher priority.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of family dynamics. The author chose to stay silent about being the reporter, which might have caused additional stress. But in some cases, anonymity is standard in CPS reports to protect the reporter. The key here is whether the actions of the brother and the mother meet the legal definition of neglect or abuse. If they do, then the report is justified. If the neglect isn't severe, maybe the author should have tried other interventions first. But given the examples\u2014leaving the child in a playpen for hours, injuries, unattended\u2014the situation seems serious enough. So, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting, even if it caused family conflict. The answer should be B.\n"
