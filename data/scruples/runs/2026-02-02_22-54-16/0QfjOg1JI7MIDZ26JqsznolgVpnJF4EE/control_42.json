For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. The situation involves the brother being a teenage father, having a rocky relationship with the baby's mother, and neglecting the child. The author reports the neglect, leading to CPS involvement and family conflicts.\n\nFirst, legal aspect: In most places, reporting suspected child neglect is not just allowed but encouraged. Laws often protect whistleblowers in such cases. The key here is whether there was actual neglect, which the author describes with examples like leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, injuries. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nEthically, it's more complex. The brother is a minor (17), which complicates things because he's also a child himself. But the child's well-being is paramount. The author's parents are already involved, but maybe not enough. The brother's actions, even if he's young, could still be neglectful. The mother's behavior is also problematic, contributing to the neglect. The author's intent was to protect the niece, which is a valid concern.\n\nFamily dynamics: The brother is upset, thinking the father reported him. The author stayed quiet, which might be to avoid family conflict, but that's understandable. The main question is if the report was justified. Since there are clear signs of neglect, the report is warranted. The brother's age doesn't absolve him from responsibility if he's neglecting the child. The author's role as a concerned relative gives them the right to report.\n\nSocial services would assess the situation. The author isn't a stranger; they're a family member. Their duty to the child's safety overrides any familial obligation to stay silent. The brother's reaction is valid but doesn't negate the necessity of the report. The author isn't the asshole here because their action was in the child's best interest. The other parties, the brother and the mother, are the ones neglecting the child.\n\nSo, answer B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
