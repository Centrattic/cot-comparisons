For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to child protective services (CPS) is in the wrong. The situation involves the brother having a child at 17 with an unstable woman. They're both neglecting the child, leaving her unattended, exposing her to swearing, and using her as leverage in their bitter breakup. The parents are stepping in, and the brother is upset that someone reported him, thinking it was his dad.\n\nThe author reports to CPS and then stays quiet about being the one who did it. The question is if this makes them an asshole. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Reporting child neglect is a legal duty in many places. Most states require any person to report suspected child abuse or neglect. So, the author isn't legally wrong. Ethically, they might be conflicted because they're a family member, but the child's well-being is the priority.\n\nThe brother's actions are clearly neglectful. Leaving a 16-month-old unattended, not supervising her leading to injuries, and using her in their conflict are serious issues. The author's intent was to protect the child, which is a valid reason. \n\nHowever, there's the aspect of family loyalty. The author didn't tell anyone they were the one who reported, which might be causing family tension. But they might have chosen silence to avoid further conflict or to protect their parents who are taking care of the child. \n\nIs staying silent the wrong part? Well, if CPS asked who reported, maybe there's an obligation to disclose, but the author didn't mention that. They just stayed quiet, which is a personal choice. The main action\u2014reporting the neglect\u2014is justified. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. Their actions were aimed at protecting a child from neglect, which is a serious matter. The brother's reaction is unfortunate, but the author's duty to the child outweighs family loyalty in this case. The answer should be B (No).\n"
