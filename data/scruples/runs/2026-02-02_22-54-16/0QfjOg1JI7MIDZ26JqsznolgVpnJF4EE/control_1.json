For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. The situation involves the brother being a teen parent and struggling with responsibilities, leading to neglect of the child. The author's brother and the baby's mother are both neglecting the child in various ways, and the parents have taken over. The author reported it to CPS, which caused tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In the U.S., any citizen can report suspected child abuse or neglect to CPS. The duty to protect a child from harm is a strong ethical point here. The brother's actions\u2014leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, injuries, and not helping with parenting\u2014could be considered neglect. The mother is also involved in problematic behavior, like dropping off the child to spite the brother. \n\nThe parents are now taking care of the child, which suggests they're trying to protect her. The author's decision to report might have been to ensure the child's safety. However, the brother is upset because he feels the report is coming from his dad. The author didn't reveal themselves, which might have been to avoid conflict, but that's part of the dilemma.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author overstepped by involving CPS, especially within a family matter. But given the potential harm to the child, the author's intent was likely protective. CPS would require evidence, which the author provided. The key here is whether the neglect is significant enough for CPS involvement. Since there are multiple incidents (injuries, neglect, parental conflict), it seems justified.\n\nEthically, protecting a child from harm is a priority. Even though the author is a sibling, the duty to prevent harm to the child could outweigh family loyalty. The brother's reaction is understandable but the child's well-being is paramount. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
