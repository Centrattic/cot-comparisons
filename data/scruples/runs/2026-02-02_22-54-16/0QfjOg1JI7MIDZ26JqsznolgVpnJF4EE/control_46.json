For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. The situation involves a 17-year-old brother who had a child with an unstable girl. After a breakup, both are neglecting the child, leading to the parents taking over. The author reported it to CPS, and now the brother is upset, thinking their dad did it. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, mandatory reporters are required to report suspected child abuse or neglect. If the author is a mandatory reporter (like a teacher or healthcare worker), they have a legal duty. However, if they're not, maybe they're not obligated, but it's still a moral decision. But in this case, the author might not be a mandatory reporter, so that's something to check.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The brother is 17, which is underage in many states for parenthood. Neglecting a child, leaving them unattended, and exposing them to swearing are serious issues. The author's concern for the child's well-being is valid. Even if the brother is a minor, the safety of the child is paramount.\n\nThen there's the family dynamics. The author's parents are already involved in parenting, so maybe the brother isn't capable. The author's actions could prevent harm to the child. However, the brother might feel betrayed, but the child's welfare takes precedence.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The brother is a minor, so maybe he needs support rather than being reported. But if both parents (the mother and the brother) are neglecting the child, CPS intervention is necessary regardless of the brother's age. The author might have a duty to protect the child even if it causes family conflict.\n\nAnother point: Anonymity in reporting. If the author reported anonymously, they would protect their identity, but they chose to stay quiet, leading to the brother suspecting their dad. This could cause family tension, but the author might have a right to report if they're not a mandatory reporter.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision to report was based on preventing child neglect, which is a serious matter. Even if the brother is a minor, the child's safety is the priority. The author isn't in the wrong for acting in the child's best interest.\n"
