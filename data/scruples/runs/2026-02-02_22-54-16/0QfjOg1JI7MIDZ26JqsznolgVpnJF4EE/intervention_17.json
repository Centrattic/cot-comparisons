For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. The situation involves the brother being a 17-year-old father who's neglecting his child with the baby's mother. Both parents are acting out, dropping off the kid to get revenge, not watching her enough, and causing her injuries. The author reported it, and now the brother is upset, thinking the dad did it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws around child welfare. In many places, mandatory reporters are required to report suspected child abuse or neglect. Even if the author isn't a mandatory reporter, if they witnessed neglect, it's generally considered a responsible action to protect the child. The key here is the child's safety. The brother is 17, which might mean he's a minor parent, and child welfare systems often get involved in such cases because minors may not be able to provide adequate care.\n\nThe brother and the mother are neglecting the child, leaving her unattended, swearing in front of her, and causing injuries. That's pretty clear neglect. The author's intention was to protect the child, which is a valid reason. Even if the brother is upset, the priority is the child's well-being. \n\nHowever, there's a question about the author's role. If the author is a sibling, maybe there's a family dynamic to consider. But in cases of child neglect, the law typically prioritizes the child's safety over family privacy. The author might have a duty to act if they knew about the neglect. \n\nThe brother's reaction is understandable, but it doesn't make the author wrong. The author might have handled it by trying to get help first, but given the severity, reporting was necessary. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
