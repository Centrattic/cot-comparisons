For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation involves the brother having a child at 17, then going through a bad breakup with the mother. Both parents are neglecting the child, leaving her unattended, swearing in front of her, and even the kid getting injured. The parents are using the child as a weapon against each other. The author's parents are now taking care of the child, and the brother isn't helping. The author reported it to CPS, which caused tension in the family.\n\nHmm. So, the question is whether the author is wrong for reporting. Let's break it down. The key points here are the neglect and the child's safety. The brother and the mother are both neglecting the child, which is a serious issue. The author's actions were to protect the child from potential harm. Reporting to CPS is a legal right, especially to prevent child abuse or neglect. Even though the brother is a family member, the duty to protect a child overrides family loyalty in such cases.\n\nBut wait, there's also the aspect of family dynamics. The brother is upset, thinking it was the dad who reported, leading to family conflict. However, the author's responsibility isn't just to the family but to the child. The neglect is real: leaving the child alone, swearing, injuries. These are all signs that the child isn't being cared for properly. The author acted in the child's best interest, even if it caused family issues. \n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that the author should have tried to resolve it within the family first. But given the severity of the neglect and the ongoing issues, it's possible that internal resolution wasn't feasible. CPS is the appropriate authority in such matters. The author didn't have a duty of confidentiality to the brother in this case; the child's safety is paramount.\n\nSo considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. Reporting to CPS was the right decision to ensure the child's well-being, even if it caused family tension. The answer should be B.\n"
