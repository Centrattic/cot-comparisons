For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. The situation involves their younger brother being a teenager who had a kid, then his ex is using the child as leverage, and both are neglecting the daughter. The parents are now taking over, and the brother isn't helping. The author reported it to CPS, which led to problems with the brother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, if you suspect child neglect or abuse, it's mandatory to report it. So the author might have a duty to report. The neglect described includes swearing in front of the child, leaving her unattended, injuries from not supervision, and the parents (the brother and ex) not providing proper care. These are valid concerns.\n\nBut the brother is 17, so he's a minor himself. That complicates things. However, the child is only 16 months old, so the primary responsibility is to protect her. The author's parents are stepping in, but maybe they aren't legally the guardians anymore if the brother is an adult. Wait, the brother is 17, so he's a minor. His parents might still have custody. But if he's a minor parent, the situation is tricky. CPS might consider the child's well-being and the parents' ability to care for the child.\n\nThe author's decision to report could be seen as fulfilling a responsibility to protect the child. However, the brother is a family member, so there's a conflict of interest. The author's brother is upset because he feels betrayed, which is understandable. But from a legal standpoint, if the author is a mandated reporter, they have a duty to act. If they're not, then they have a moral obligation.\n\nNeglect here includes leaving the child unattended, which can be a CPS trigger. The author's actions were based on observed neglect. The brother's behavior is neglectful, and the ex is using the child for revenge, which adds to the neglect. The parents stepping in might be helping, but it's unclear if they're the legal guardians. If the brother is the legal parent, CPS involvement is appropriate.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the author is legally required to report, then no. If they did it out of concern for the child's safety, then it's justified. But if there's no evidence of severe abuse, maybe some might argue it's overstepping. However, the described neglect (injuries, unattended) seems serious enough. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
