For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to Child Protective Services (CPS) is in the wrong. The situation is a bit complex. The brother had a kid at 17, and there's been a lot of conflict between him and the baby's mother. They seem to be using the child as a way to get back at each other. The brother isn't helping out much, and the mother is doing things like dropping the kid off unexpectedly and taking her for Instagram pictures. The parents are now taking over most of the parenting duties, but the brother is neglecting his responsibilities. The person in question reported this to CPS, and now the brother is upset, thinking the dad did it. The question is whether the reporter is an asshole for doing that and/or for staying quiet about it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The brother is 17 (or maybe older now?), and the child is 16 months. The neglect includes things like swearing in front of the kid, leaving her unattended, playpen for hours, injuries from not watching her enough. The parents are stepping in, but the brother isn't helping. The mother is also not a good role model. The reporter's intention was to protect the child from neglect. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, you are legally required to report suspected child neglect or abuse. So if the reporter is in a state where they are a mandatory reporter, then they might have a legal obligation. Even if not, if someone has reasonable cause to believe a child is in danger, reporting is the right thing to do. The brother and the mother are both not providing adequate care, which could be considered neglect.\n\nBut then there's the family aspect. The brother might feel betrayed, and the reporter is now causing family tension. The brother is losing his parental rights, which is a severe consequence. Is the reporter's action justified? The answer would depend on whether the neglect is actually occurring and the reporter's belief in that. The details provided suggest that the child is being left unattended, injured, and exposed to swearing. Those are valid concerns for CPS. \n\nThe other side is the brother's rights. Even if there's neglect, CPS might step in, but the brother's relationship with his child could be affected. The reporter might have done the right thing to protect the child, even if it causes family conflict. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to address the issue without involving CPS, like family intervention, but given the circumstances, it's unclear if that's possible. The brother isn't stepping up, and the mother isn't helping. The parents are taking over, but maybe that's not sustainable or legal in the long run.\n\nSo, the question is whether the reporter is in the wrong. If the neglect is real, then reporting is the right action. If the reporter is lying or exaggerating, then they'd be in the wrong. From the description, the reporter is giving specific examples: leaving the kid in a playpen for hours, injuries from lack of supervision, neglecting responsibilities. These are legitimate signs of neglect. The mother's behavior of using the child as a weapon is also problematic.\n\nTherefore, the reporter's intention was to protect the child, not just to get their brother in trouble. Even though it caused family issues, the child's safety is paramount. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). However, there's a nuance here. If the reporter acted without exhausting all possible family support, maybe there's a consideration. But given the severity of the neglect described, it's hard to argue that reporting was wrong. So B is the correct choice.\n"
