For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 17-year-old brother who became a father through a tumultuous relationship. Both the mother and brother are neglecting the child in various ways\u2014leaving her unattended, swearing in front of her, not watching her leading to injuries, and general neglect. The parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, and the brother isn't contributing. The author reported this to CPS, and now there's family conflict because the brother is upset, thinking their dad reported him.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions were justified. The key here is the child's well-being. If the child is being neglected or harmed, then reporting to CPS is a responsible action. CPS exists to protect children from abuse and neglect. The examples given\u2014leaving the child unattended, injuries from not supervision, and emotional neglect\u2014could all be valid reasons for a CPS report.\n\nHowever, the brother is only 17, which might affect how the situation is viewed. In many places, the legal age to parent is 18, but that doesn't excuse neglect. The mother figure (baby momma) is also a young parent, and both are unstable. The parents taking over seems like a temporary fix, but if they're not the legal guardians, it's still the state's responsibility to ensure the child's safety.\n\nThe brother's reaction is anger and blaming the parents, but the author's intent was to protect the child. The question is whether the report was necessary. The author might feel guilty for causing family strife, but the priority should be the child's welfare. Staying silent could lead to further harm to the child, which is a serious concern.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should have tried to resolve the issue within the family first. However, given the severity of the neglect and the risk to the child, waiting might not be safe. CPS is the appropriate authority to handle such cases. The author isn't obligated to stay silent even if it causes family problems.\n\nSo, considering the child's safety and the legal duty to report neglect, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
