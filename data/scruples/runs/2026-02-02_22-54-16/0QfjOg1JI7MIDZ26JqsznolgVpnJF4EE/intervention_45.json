For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to child protective services. The situation involves the brother having a child at 17, and both he and the mother being neglectful. The author reports to CPS, leading to some tension in the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, reporting suspected child neglect or abuse is not only a right but a legal duty for any person, not just professionals. Mandatory reporters, like teachers or doctors, have to report, but others can do so as well. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The child's safety is the primary concern. If the brother and the mother are neglecting the child, leaving them unattended, exposing them to swearing, and using them as leverage in their conflicts, that's a serious issue. The author's actions could prevent harm to the child. Ethically, protecting a child from harm is usually seen as the right choice, even if it causes family strife.\n\nFamily dynamics matter too. The brother is upset and blames their dad, but the author might have felt it was necessary to act. The parents are already involved, but maybe not enough. The author might feel conflicted about exposing a family member but prioritizing the child's welfare.\n\nPossible counterarguments: some might say the author should have tried to resolve it within the family first. However, if the neglect is ongoing and the parents aren't stepping in effectively, external intervention is necessary. Also, the author might not have the authority or resources to handle it alone.\n\nAlso, the author didn't reveal themselves, which could be seen as avoiding conflict. But sometimes, remaining anonymous is necessary to protect oneself, especially if the family is hostile. The key is that the report was made to protect the child, which is the main priority.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author acted to protect a child from neglect, which is a valid reason. Legally and ethically, the author isn't in the wrong. The family conflict is a side effect, but the child's safety comes first.\n"
