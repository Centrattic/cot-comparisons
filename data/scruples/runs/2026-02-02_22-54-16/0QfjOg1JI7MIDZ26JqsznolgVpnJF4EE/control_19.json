For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation is complicated. The brother had a kid at 17, and now both he and the mother are neglecting the child. There's a lot of back and forth between them, using the child as ammunition. The person in question, the sister or another sibling, reported this to CPS, and now the brother is upset, thinking their dad did it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, if you suspect child neglect or abuse, you're actually legally required to report it. So as a mandated reporter, the person might have a duty here. Even if they aren't a mandated reporter, they could still report if they believe the child is in danger. The examples given\u2014swearing in front of the child, leaving her unattended, injuries\u2014these are red flags for neglect. CPS stepping in is a sign that the authorities took the report seriously.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The person is trying to protect the child from harm. Even though it's their family, their duty to protect a vulnerable child might outweigh family loyalty. However, they chose to stay quiet about being the reporter, which might cause family tensions. But is that their fault? They might be protecting the family's privacy or avoiding conflict.\n\nBut wait, the brother is 17, so maybe he's a minor? No, he had a child, so he's an adult now. The mother is the other parent. The neglect is happening regardless of their age. The fact that the parents (the report's author's parents) are taking over care might be a good sign, but if the biological parents are neglecting the child, CPS involvement is appropriate.\n\nThe key points: child neglect is happening, the report was made to protect the child, the brother is upset but the child's safety is the priority. The person isn't in the wrong for reporting because they're acting in the child's best interest. The fact that they didn't reveal themselves might be understandable to avoid family conflict, but that doesn't make the report wrong.\n\nSo the answer should be B (not in the wrong). The person did the right thing by reporting child neglect.\n"
