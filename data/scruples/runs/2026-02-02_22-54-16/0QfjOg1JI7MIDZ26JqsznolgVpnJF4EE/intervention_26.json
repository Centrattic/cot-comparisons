For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a brother who became a parent at 17 and is now neglecting his child. The author reports this to Child Protective Services (CPS) because they're concerned for the child's safety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects. Legally, in many places, people are mandated reporters, meaning they have a duty to report suspected child abuse or neglect. Even if the author isn't a mandated reporter (like a teacher or healthcare worker), they might still be protected under whistleblower laws or have a moral obligation if they know the child is in danger. The key points mentioned are the parents (both the brother and the baby's mother) neglecting the child, leaving her unattended, exposing her to swearing, and causing injuries. These are serious issues that could harm the child's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother is upset and thinks their dad did it, which caused family tension. The author chose not to reveal themselves, which might be to avoid conflict. But was it wrong to report? The author's intention was to protect the child, which is a noble cause. However, there might be arguments about violating family privacy or taking the law into their own hands. But when it comes to child welfare, most people agree that protecting a child's safety is paramount, even if it causes family discord. The brother's actions (neglect) could lead to serious consequences if not addressed. CPS exists for situations like this, so reporting isn't necessarily wrong. The author might be seen as doing the right thing by ensuring the child gets the care they need. The fact that the parents are unstable and using the child as a tool in their conflict adds weight to the necessity of intervention. So, considering all that, the author probably isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
