For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. The situation involves the brother having a child at 17, then a breakup leading to neglect of the child. The author reports it, and now the brother is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The brother is neglecting the child by leaving her with strangers, not supervising her, which led to injuries. The mother is also abusive, using the child as a weapon. The parents are stepping in, but the brother isn't helping. The author reports to CPS, which is a legal and ethical way to address child neglect.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, any citizen can report suspected child abuse or neglect. The author isn't a parent or legal guardian, but they observed neglect and took action. The brother's actions (leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, injuries) could be considered neglectful. The author's intention was to protect the child, which is a valid reason.\n\nEmotionally, the brother is upset because he feels betrayed. But the author's priority was the child's safety. The author also chose to stay silent about being the reporter, which might be to protect their family from further conflict. That's understandable, as exposing themselves could cause more tension.\n\nIs there a wrong here? The brother's actions are harmful, and the author acted in the child's best interest. Reporting to CPS is a responsible action. The brother's reaction is emotional, but the author isn't in the wrong for trying to help. The answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
