For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation is that the brother had a child at 17, and the relationship with the baby's mother is toxic. They both neglect the child, leave her alone a lot, and use her as leverage. The parents are now caring for the kid, and the brother isn't helping. The author reported to CPS, and now the brother is upset, thinking the dad did it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the neglect is severe enough to warrant CPS involvement. The examples given are swearing in front of the child, leaving her unattended, in a playpen while he plays games, and injuries. These are concerning, especially for a 16-month-old. CPS usually steps in when there's neglect or endangerment. The author might believe they were doing the right thing to protect the child.\n\nOn the other hand, family dynamics can be complex. The brother is young and maybe struggling, but the mother is also involved, and the author didn't report her. However, the report was about the brother's actions. The brother is angry and thinks their dad did it, leading to family conflict. The author didn't reveal themselves, which might cause more tension.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Legally, reporting suspected abuse or neglect is a right and responsibility. However, ethically, it's about the intent and context. The author's actions were to protect the child, which is a valid concern. But maybe the family could have addressed it internally first? However, when there's neglect, external intervention is necessary. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any aspect where the author acted wrongfully. They didn't disclose being the reporter, but staying silent after the report isn't wrong. The main issue is the neglect, so B makes sense.\n"
