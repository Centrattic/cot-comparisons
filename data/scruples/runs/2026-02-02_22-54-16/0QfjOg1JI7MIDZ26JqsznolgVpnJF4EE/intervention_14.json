For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to child protective services. The situation involves the brother's daughter being neglected and used as a pawn in a bitter custody battle between him and the baby's mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, reporting suspected child abuse or neglect is not only allowed but encouraged, and reporters are often protected. The author witnessed instances of neglect like the child being left unattended, swearing in front of her, and injuries. These could be valid concerns for CPS to investigate.\n\nEthically, the author is trying to protect a vulnerable child. Even though it's a family member, the brother isn't fulfilling his parental duties. The parents have taken over most responsibilities, but the situation is dire. The brother's actions, like not helping and the baby mom's manipulative behavior, contribute to the child's neglect.\n\nThe author's decision to report might have caused family tension, but the child's safety is the priority. Staying silent could mean the child continues to be at risk. The author didn't act out of malice but concern. CPS is there to assess situations, not just to punish. The brother's anger is a consequence of the situation, but the author's intent was protective.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should have tried to resolve it within the family first. But given the instability and the mother's behavior, it's possible that internal solutions weren't effective. The author might have felt those efforts failed, so reporting was the next step.\n\nAlso, the author didn't reveal themselves, which could be seen as a flaw, but it's common to remain anonymous to avoid family conflict. The key is whether the action was justified. Since there's evidence of neglect, the report seems warranted.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
