For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to Child Protective Services (CPS) is in the wrong. The situation involves the brother having a child at 17 with an unstable partner, both parents being neglectful, and the child being exposed to a harmful environment. The author stepped in after the parents took over most of the responsibilities but the brother wasn't helping. They reported the neglect to CPS, which caused tension in the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many jurisdictions, reporting suspected child abuse or neglect is a legal duty for any person, not just professionals. So the author did their legal obligation by reporting. From a moral standpoint, they might be doing the right thing to protect the child from harm. However, there's also the family dynamics to consider. The brother is upset, and the author didn't disclose they were the one who reported, which could be seen as not being honest with family. But the main issue is the child's safety versus family loyalty.\n\nThe key points are the child's well-being, the neglectful behavior of both the brother and the mother, and the consequences of the report. The author's actions led to CPS intervention, which is the right channel for such situations. While withholding information about being the reporter could be a point of contention, the primary responsibility to protect the child seems to outweigh family loyalty in this case. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
