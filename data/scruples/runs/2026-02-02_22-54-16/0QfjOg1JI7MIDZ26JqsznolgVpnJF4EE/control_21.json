For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation is complicated.\n\nFirst, the brother became a father at 17 and had some issues with the baby's mother. They're both neglecting the child, leaving her unattended, swearing in front of her, and using her as a weapon in their arguments. The parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, and the brother isn't helping. The person in question reported this to CPS, which caused conflict in the family.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether reporting to CPS was the right action. On one hand, child neglect is a serious matter. Even if it's not extreme, leaving a 16-month-old unattended, not supervising properly leading to injuries, and exposing her to verbal abuse are all red flags. CPS exists to protect children from such situations, so reporting it could be seen as responsible.\n\nOn the other hand, the reporter is the sibling, so there's a family dynamic. Maybe they should have tried to resolve it within the family first? But if the parents are already involved and the situation isn't improving, maybe external intervention is necessary. Also, the brother is an adult, but the child is vulnerable. The reporter's intention was to protect the niece/nephew, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe brother is upset, thinking the dad did it, but the reporter stayed silent about being the one who reported. That might add to the tension. However, staying quiet about it could be to avoid family conflict, which is understandable. But lying by omission about the report might not be the best approach, but the main question is about the report itself.\n\nOverall, the reporter acted to protect a child from neglect, which is a serious duty of any adult. Even if family relationships are strained, the child's welfare is paramount. So the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. Maybe if the reporter had evidence or if the report was unfounded? The scenario describes multiple incidents that could be considered neglect. So, the report seems justified. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
