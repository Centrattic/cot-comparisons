For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to child protective services (CPS). The situation involves the brother being a teenager when he had a child, and now both he and the baby's mother are neglecting the child. The author reports this to CPS, leading to some family conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation based on the information given. The key points are the neglect: swearing in front of the child, leaving her unattended, injuries, and the parents not helping. The author's brother isn't contributing, and the mother is using the child for social media. The author stepped in because they were concerned about the child's welfare.\n\nLegally, in the U.S., reporting suspected child abuse or neglect is mandatory for certain professionals, but it's also a legal right for any citizen. So the author isn't obligated, but they chose to do the right thing. The brother is 17, so even if he's a parent, the law might consider the child's well-being as the priority. The author's intention was to protect the child, which is a valid concern. \n\nHowever, there's a family aspect here. The brother is upset, thinking the father reported him. The author didn't reveal themselves, which might be causing more tension. But staying silent could also be seen as allowing harm to continue. The neglect is causing the child to be injured and neglected, so the author's action was to intervene when others (like the parents) aren't stepping up.\n\nMoral-wise, protecting a child from harm is generally seen as the right action. The brother's reaction is understandable, but he's the one at fault here for the neglect. The author isn't in the wrong for taking action to ensure the child's safety. Also, not reporting could be complicit in the neglect. So, the answer is B.\n"
