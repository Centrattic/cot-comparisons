For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. The situation involves a 17-year-old brother who became a father and is now neglecting the child with the mother. The author reports them, leading to CPS involvement, and now the brother is upset, thinking their dad did it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, you can report suspected child abuse or neglect anonymously to CPS, and it's actually a legal obligation if you suspect harm. The author mentions neglectful behaviors like leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, and injuries. These could be valid reasons for a CPS report.\n\nEthically, the author's concern is for the child's safety. Even though it's a family member, the child's well-being is paramount. The brother isn't providing adequate care, and the ex is using the child for personal gain. The parents are stepping in, but maybe not enough. The author's intervention might prevent further harm.\n\nHowever, there's the family dynamics aspect. The brother is taking it hard, and the author isn't telling anyone they did it. But staying silent after reporting could be seen as not being transparent, which might cause more tension. But the author might fear family backlash if they come forward.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, legally, reporting is correct. Ethically, the child's safety is the priority. The brother's reaction is regrettable, but the author's action was to protect the child. The answer leans towards B (not in the wrong), but I should check if there's any nuance I'm missing, like if the author had a duty to talk to the brother first. But in cases of neglect, immediate action is often necessary. So yes, B makes sense.\n"
