For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the details carefully.\n\nThe brother had a kid at 17, which isn't great, but maybe he was trying his best. Then there's the breakup, and both he and the mother are using the child as a weapon. The examples given are dropping the kid off unexpectedly, neglecting her, swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, and even injuries. The parents are now taking over most of the parenting duties, and the brother isn't helping. The mother uses the child for Instagram pictures and to mess with the brother.\n\nThe author reported all this to CPS. Now the brother is upset, thinking the dad did it. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, mandatory reporters are required to report suspected child neglect or abuse. If the author is a mandatory reporter (like a teacher or healthcare worker), they might legally have to report. But even if they're not, witnessing neglect and taking action to protect the child could be seen as responsible.\n\nThe key here is the welfare of the child. The examples given suggest neglect: leaving the child unattended, injuries, exposure to swearing. Those are red flags. The author's intention was to protect the child, which is a valid concern. However, there's the potential strain on family relationships. But the brother's actions, like using the child as a weapon and neglecting her, might justify the report.\n\nIs there a better way to handle it? Maybe trying to mediate or involve other family members first? But the parents are already involved, and the situation hasn't improved. The author might have felt it was necessary to escalate to CPS to ensure the child's safety.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should have given the brother more chances or not taken the initiative. But given the ongoing neglect and the child's well-being, the priority should be the child's safety. The brother's anger is a consequence, but the moral obligation is to protect the vulnerable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They acted in the child's best interest, even if it caused family conflict. The answer should be B.\n"
