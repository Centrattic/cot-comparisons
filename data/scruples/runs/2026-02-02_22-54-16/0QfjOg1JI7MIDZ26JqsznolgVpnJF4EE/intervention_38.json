For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to child protective services (CPS). The situation involves the brother having a child at 17, and both the mother and brother treating the child poorly, with neglect and using her as a weapon in their conflicts. The brother isn't helping, and the parents are taking over. The author reported the incidents, and now the brother is upset, thinking their dad did it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, reporting suspected child abuse or neglect is not only a legal right but a responsibility for any person. Laws often protect mandated reporters (like teachers, doctors), but other individuals can report as well. The key is whether there were valid reasons to believe the child was in danger.\n\nThe described neglect includes swearing in front of the child, leaving her unattended, injuries from lack of supervision, and using her as a pawn in their bitter relationship. These could qualify as neglect under CPS criteria. The mother's behavior, like dropping off the child to get back at the brother, also indicates a lack of proper care.\n\nThe author's intention seems to be protecting the child. They felt their parents weren't handling it, so they took action. Even if the brother is upset, the priority is the child's safety. The author didn't have to stay silent; their duty to protect the child overrides family tensions. The brother's reaction, while hurtful, doesn't negate the validity of the report.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a nuance if the author had a personal motive, but the story doesn't indicate that. The author mentions staying quiet about being the reporter, which could be to avoid conflict, but that's a personal choice, not malicious intent.\n\nIn conclusion, the author acted to prevent harm to a child, which is generally seen as the right thing to do. Even if family dynamics are strained, the child's well-being comes first. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
