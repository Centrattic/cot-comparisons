For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves their brother, who became a father at 17 and is now neglecting the child due to a bad breakup. The baby's mother is also not doing well, dropping the kid off unexpectedly, and using her as \"ammunition.\" The author reports this to CPS, leading to their brother being upset and blaming their dad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, if you suspect child neglect or abuse, it's your legal duty to report it to authorities like CPS. So legally, the author might be doing the right thing. But the question is about being in the wrong morally or socially.\n\nThe brother's actions\u2014like leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, not helping with parenting duties\u2014could be considered neglect. The mother isn't helping either. The author's parents are stepping in, which is good, but the brother isn't contributing. The author might feel responsible to protect the child, especially if the parents are overwhelmed.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should have tried to resolve the issue within the family first, without involving CPS. But if the situation is as bad as described (injuries to the child, consistent neglect), then waiting until it's worse could be dangerous. The author might not be in the wrong for intervening when the child is at risk.\n\nAlso, the brother is lashing out and blaming their dad. That's a problem, but the author didn't tell anyone they were the one who reported. So maybe they're handling that part quietly. The main issue is whether the report was justified. Since CPS stepped in and the child is in danger, the author's actions might be seen as necessary.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author acted out of concern for the child's safety, followed legal obligations, and tried to prevent further harm. Even though family tensions are high, the priority is the child's well-being. Therefore, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
