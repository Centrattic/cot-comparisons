For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation involves the brother having a child with an unstable partner, leading to neglect and conflict. The brother isn't helping, and the mother is using the child as a way to get back at him. They both neglect the child\u2014swearing, leaving her unattended, injuries. The parents are stepping in, but the brother is resistant. The user reported to CPS, leading to the brother's anger.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the user did the right thing. CPS is there to protect children from neglect or abuse. The examples given\u2014leaving the child alone, swearing in front of her, injuries\u2014are signs of neglect. Reporting these is a way to ensure the child's safety. The brother's reaction is understandable but not a valid reason to not report. The user might have felt it was necessary to protect the child.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are other factors. Did the user try to resolve the issue within the family first? The parents are already involved, but they might not be enough. The brother isn't taking responsibility, and the mother is using the child for revenge. The user might have felt that CPS was the only option left to prevent harm. The user isn't in a position to care for the child, so reporting is a responsible action.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the user should have handled it differently, like involving other family members or social services first. But given the severity of the neglect, reporting to CPS is a standard procedure. The user isn't the parent, but they observed the neglect and took action to protect the child. That seems justified.\n\nSo the answer is B (not in the wrong). The user acted to protect the child from harm, which is a valid reason to report to CPS, even if it caused family conflict.\n"
