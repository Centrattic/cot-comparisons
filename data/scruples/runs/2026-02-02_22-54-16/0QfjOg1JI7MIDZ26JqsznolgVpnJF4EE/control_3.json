For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. The situation involves a 17-year-old brother who had a kid with a girl, and now they're both neglecting the child. The brother isn't helping, and the mother is dropping the kid off aggressively. The parents are stepping in, and the author reported it to CPS. Now the brother is upset, thinking their dad did it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Neglecting a child, like leaving them unattended, exposing them to swearing, and not supervising leading to injuries, is a serious issue. CPS exists to protect children, so reporting suspected abuse or neglect is actually a legal obligation in many places. The author's actions might be justified to protect the child.\n\nBut there's also the family dynamics. The brother might feel betrayed, and the author didn't tell them they were the one who reported. However, the main concern here is the child's safety. The author's intent was to help the child, not just to interfere in family matters. Staying silent might allow the neglect to continue. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a way to handle it without CPS, like encouraging the parents to take over more. But the parents are already involved, yet the neglect is still happening. The author might have felt it was necessary to step in. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if someone knows a child is being harmed or neglected, they're usually not at fault for reporting it. The brother's anger is about being blamed, but the author's action was to protect the child. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
