For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the brother became a father at 17, which is young and challenging. Initially, he was doing okay, but after a bad breakup, things fell apart. Both he and the mother are using their daughter as a weapon against each other. The mother drops off the kid unannounced, leading to police intervention. The brother isn't helping, leaving the child unattended, and there's neglect like swearing in front of her and injuries from being left alone.\n\nThe parents are now taking over, and the brother isn't contributing. The sister reports this to CPS, which caused conflict because the brother blames their dad. The question is whether the sister did the right thing by reporting.\n\nLegally, CPS is there to protect children from neglect and abuse. If the sister observed neglect (like leaving the child unattended, injuries), then reporting is within her rights. She's acting in the child's best interest. However, she didn't disclose her identity, which might cause family tension. But her primary responsibility isn't to the family's feelings but to the child's safety. The brother's behavior is neglectful, so reporting is justified. The sister isn't in the wrong for protecting the child, even if it causes family conflict.\n"
