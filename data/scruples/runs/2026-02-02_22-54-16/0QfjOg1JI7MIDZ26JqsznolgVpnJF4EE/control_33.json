For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to Child Protective Services (CPS). The situation involves the brother, who is 17 years old and a father, being neglectful towards his child. The mother of the child is also unstable and uses the child as a weapon in their bitter relationship. The author reports the neglect to CPS, leading to the brother's anger.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal and ethical aspects here. The brother is a minor (17) and a parent. In many jurisdictions, parents have rights, but those rights are contingent on the child's safety. Neglect, such as leaving a child unattended, exposing them to swearing, and not providing adequate supervision, can be considered child abuse or neglect, which CPS is designed to address.\n\nThe brother's actions include leaving the child in a playpen while gaming for hours, the child injuring herself, and both parents using the child as a way to harm each other. The mother drops the child off unexpectedly to spite the father. The parents are neglecting their duties, and the grandparents (the user's parents) are stepping in. The user, seeing this, reports to CPS. \n\nLegally, in many places, if someone has reason to believe a child is being neglected or abused, they are legally obligated to report it. The user is acting within their legal rights by making the report. Ethically, the user is trying to protect the child from harm, which is a moral duty. The brother's reaction is anger, but that doesn't negate the initial wrongdoing of the parents.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The brother is a minor, which might complicate things. But the focus is on the child's well-being. The user's intent is to protect the child, which is a valid reason. The brother's anger and the family conflict don't make the user wrong. The user might have considered intervening in other ways first, like speaking directly to the brother or other family members, but given the situation's severity, reporting to CPS is a responsible action to ensure the child's safety.\n\nThe user also chose not to reveal themselves as the reporter, which might be a way to avoid family conflict. While that could be seen as hiding behind the system, the main issue is the child's welfare. The user isn't in the wrong for making the report to protect the child, even if it causes family tension. The brother's neglect is the root problem here.\n"
