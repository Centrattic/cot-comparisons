For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation involves a 17-year-old brother who had a child with an unstable girl, and now both he and the mother are neglecting the child. The person reported to CPS, and now the brother is upset, thinking it was their dad.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The brother is 17, which is a minor in most states, but he's a parent. The neglect includes swearing in front of the child, leaving her unattended, not supervising enough leading to injuries, and the mother using the child as a weapon in their disputes. The parents have taken over most of the parenting, and the brother isn't helping. The reporter decided to report to CPS after discussing with their dad.\n\nNow, the question is whether the reporter is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn many jurisdictions, mandatory reporters are required to report suspected child abuse or neglect. Even if the reporter isn't a mandatory reporter (like a teacher or doctor), they might still be acting in the child's best interest. However, some might argue that family matters should be handled internally, but neglect is a serious issue that can affect the child's well-being.\n\nThe brother is a minor, which complicates things because he might not be considered capable of adequately caring for the child. The neglect described\u2014leaving the child unattended, injuries, etc.\u2014could be considered sufficient grounds for CPS involvement. The reporter's intention seems to be protecting the child, which is a valid concern.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that the reporter could have tried other avenues first, like involving other family members or social services without formal reporting. But given the severity of the neglect, especially with a 16-month-old, it's a critical situation where intervention might be necessary.\n\nCPS stepping in is a formal process that can be stressful for the family, and the brother's reaction is understandable, but the primary concern is the child's safety. The reporter's duty to protect the child might outweigh family dynamics here.\n\nSo, considering the potential harm to the child versus the family conflict, the reporter is likely acting correctly. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
