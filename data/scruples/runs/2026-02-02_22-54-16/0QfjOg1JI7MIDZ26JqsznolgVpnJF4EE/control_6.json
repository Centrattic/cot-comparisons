For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation involves the brother having a child at 17, a complicated breakup with the mother, and both parents neglecting the child. The brother isn't helping, the mother uses the child as a tool, and the parents are now taking over. The person reported to CPS, which caused the brother to lash out.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether there's actual neglect happening. The post mentions swearing in front of the child, leaving her unattended, playpen without supervision, injuries from not being watched, and the brother not contributing. Those are red flags for child neglect. CPS is meant to protect children in such situations.\n\nThe user's action is reporting these incidents. Legally, in many places, you can report suspected child abuse or neglect anonymously, and it's a duty to do so. So by law, they might be right. But the social aspect is tricky. The brother feels betrayed, and the reporter is staying quiet about their involvement, which might cause family tension.\n\nBut the key is the child's well-being. If the actions taken prevented harm, they're justified. The brother's reaction is part of the fallout, but the reporter's intent was to protect the child. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong. They're fulfilling their responsibility to protect a vulnerable child.\n"
