For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation involves the brother being a teenager when he had a child, and now there's a lot of conflict with the mother and the child's well-being is at risk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Reporting suspected child neglect or abuse is usually protected by law. In many places, it's even a legal duty for certain professionals, but as a private citizen, you have the right to report if you have reasonable cause. The key here is whether the author had valid reasons to believe the child was being neglected.\n\nThe scenario mentions specific instances: swearing in front of the child, leaving her unattended, injuries, and the parents using the child as leverage. These could be signs of neglect. The parents are not fulfilling their duties, and the child's safety is compromised. The author's parents are stepping in, but the brother isn't helping. The author's action was to report to CPS, which is an appropriate step to ensure the child's safety.\n\nNow, the brother is upset, but that doesn't necessarily make the report wrong. The author had a concern for the child's welfare. Staying silent could also be unethical if there's a risk of harm. The fact that there's a history of neglect and the parents are not addressing it makes the report justifiable. The author isn't a direct family member in the care situation, so their perspective is an external one, which might make them a good reporter.\n\nI should also consider if there's any malice or false information in the report. The question doesn't indicate that. The author is sharing what they've observed. Even if the brother is upset, the decision to report was based on concerns for the child's safety. So, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
