For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the brother became a father at 17, which is young. He had some issues after a breakup with the mother, leading to both of them neglecting the child. Examples given include leaving the child unattended in a playpen, swearing in front of her, and even instances where the child injured herself. The parents are now taking over most of the parenting duties, and the brother isn't contributing. The sister reported this to CPS, which led to CPS stepping in, and the brother is upset, thinking their dad did it.\n\nNow, the question is whether the sister is in the wrong for reporting. From an ethical standpoint, CPS is responsible for protecting children from neglect or abuse. If there's credible evidence of neglect, reporting it is a responsible action. The sister is trying to protect the child's well-being, even if it causes family conflict. However, there might be a consideration about whether she gave the brother a chance to improve or if there's a better way to handle it. But given the ongoing neglect and the child's safety being at risk, her actions seem justified. The brother's anger is a result of his own actions, so the sister isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
