For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to Child Protective Services (CPS). The situation involves the brother having a child at 17, then after a breakup, both he and the mother are neglecting the child. The author reports them to CPS, and now the brother is upset, thinking the dad did it.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from both sides. The brother's actions\u2014leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, not helping with parenting duties\u2014do sound like neglect. The mother is also involved in dropping off the child to get back at the brother, which is harmful. The parents are stepping in, but the brother isn't contributing. The author, as a sibling, felt compelled to report this to protect the child.\n\nLegally, in many places, you can report suspected child neglect or abuse to CPS. The law often allows any person to report if they believe a child is in danger. So the author isn't breaking any laws by reporting. Ethically, the question is about protecting the child versus family loyalty. The brother might see it as betrayal, but the child's safety is paramount.\n\nThe brother's reaction is understandable, but the author's action was to prevent harm. The neglect described, even if not extreme, could be harmful to a 16-month-old. The author might be in the right because they prioritized the child's welfare over family tensions. However, some might argue that the author should have tried to resolve it within the family first or that CPS might overreact. But the key point is the child's well-being. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
