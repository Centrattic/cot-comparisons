For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. The situation involves a teenage brother who has a child with an unstable woman, and both parents are neglecting the child. The author reported it, and now the brother is upset. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but wants a confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In most jurisdictions, there's a duty to report child neglect or abuse. As a sibling, the author might not be a legal mandated reporter, but many states allow any person to report concerns. The key here is whether the neglect is significant enough to warrant intervention. The examples given\u2014swearing in front of the child, leaving her unattended, playpen for hours, injuries\u2014are all signs of neglect. CPS stepping in suggests that the report was justified.\n\nEthically, the author is trying to protect a vulnerable child. Even though it's a family member, the child's well-being comes first. The brother's reaction is understandable but doesn't negate the responsibility to act. The author might be right in reporting, as neglecting a child is serious. Also, staying silent could allow the situation to worsen. The brother's anger is a consequence of the action, but the intent was to help the child. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
