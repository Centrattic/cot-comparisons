For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. The situation is pretty complex. The brother had a kid at 17, went through a breakup, and now both him and the mother are neglecting the child. The author reports this to CPS, which leads to the brother being upset and blaming their dad.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what CPS does. Child Protective Services is responsible for investigating reports of child abuse or neglect. If there's evidence of neglect, like leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, the child getting injured, then reporting is their duty. The author's actions might be justified here because the well-being of the child is at stake.\n\nBut wait, the brother is a minor himself? Wait, no, the brother is 17 when the child was born, but now he's older? The story mentions that the child is 16 months old, so the brother would be around 18 or 19 now. So he's an adult, but still a parent. The neglect is on his part, so reporting him as a parent to CPS is appropriate.\n\nThe key points are the neglectful behaviors: leaving the child unattended, injuries, swearing in front of her. These are classic signs that CPS would take seriously. The author's intention was to protect the child, which is a valid reason. However, the brother is upset and the family dynamics are strained because of the report. But the author's duty here is to the child's safety, not the brother's feelings.\n\nAlso, the author didn't tell the brother they reported, which is common in CPS cases for confidentiality. The brother is blaming the dad, which might be a red herring. The author's silence could be to protect the process or to avoid family conflict. However, staying quiet might lead to ongoing neglect if the situation doesn't improve.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on the justification of the report. Since the neglect is real and the child is at risk, the report is necessary. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
