For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation is that the brother had a kid at 17 and now he's neglecting the child, along with the baby's mother. They're both being pretty irresponsible, using the kid as a way to get back at each other. The sister steps in and reports them, and now the brother is upset, blaming the dad. The question is whether the sister did the right thing or not.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Reporting child neglect is usually a legal obligation in many places. If a child is being harmed or neglected, it's actually required by law to report it. So the sister might be doing her duty by protecting the child.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the brother is failing to care for his daughter properly. Leaving her unattended, exposing her to swearing, and not helping out while the parents are taking over\u2014this seems like neglect. The sister's intention is to protect the child, which is a good motive. Even though it caused family conflict, the child's well-being is a priority.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of family dynamics. The sister didn't inform the brother, which might have led to his feeling betrayed. However, if she had talked to him first, maybe the situation wouldn't have changed because the brother wasn't stepping up. Also, the mother figure is involved in the neglect, so it's not just the brother. The sister's silence could have allowed the neglect to continue. \n\nIn some cases, people might argue that she shouldn't have gone behind the brother's back, but given the circumstances of active neglect and the potential harm to the child, the sister's actions are justified. CPS exists to intervene in such situations, so her report was appropriate. Even though the brother is upset, the child's safety is more important than family tensions. \n\nSo putting it all together, the sister isn't in the wrong. She took action to protect the child, which is the right thing to do, even if it caused conflict. The answer should be B.\n"
