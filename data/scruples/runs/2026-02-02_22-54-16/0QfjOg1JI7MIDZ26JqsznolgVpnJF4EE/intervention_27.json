For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author reporting their brother to Child Protective Services (CPS) because of neglect towards his child. The brother is 17, had a kid, and now there's a lot of conflict between him and the baby's mother. They're using the child against each other, and there are instances of neglect like swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, and injuries.\n\nThe author's main concern is whether they did the right thing by reporting CPS. They also mention staying silent about being the one who reported it. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and ethical aspects. In many places, mandatory reporters (like teachers, doctors) have to report suspected child abuse or neglect. But even if you're not a mandatory reporter, you might still be legally allowed to report if you have concerns. So, from a legal standpoint, even if it's not mandatory, it's often permissible to report to CPS. \n\nEthically, the author's intention seems to be protecting the child from neglect and harm. The brother is clearly not providing proper care, and the mother is using the child as a tool. The parents are stepping in, but maybe not enough. The author's action was to prevent further harm, which is a moral duty in many people's eyes.\n\nHowever, there's also the family dynamics angle. The brother is upset and blames the dad, which is causing family tension. The author stayed silent about reporting, which might be causing additional stress. But the core issue is the child's safety. \n\nPotential arguments against the author: Maybe they should have tried to help the brother first before reporting, or maybe they overstepped by not discussing it more. But given the severity of the neglect (injuries, lack of supervision), waiting might not be safe. Also, the author might not have the authority to decide that on their own, but if there's a risk of harm, CPS is the right avenue.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's action was to protect a child from harm, which is a strong ethical stance. The brother's reaction is unfortunate, but the child's well-being is paramount. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
