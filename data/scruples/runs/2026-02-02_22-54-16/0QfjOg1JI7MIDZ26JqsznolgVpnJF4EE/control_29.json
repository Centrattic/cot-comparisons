For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user, who is the older brother, reported their younger brother to Child Protective Services (CPS) because of concerns about the 16-month-old niece being neglected. The younger brother had a child at 17 and is going back and forth with the ex-girlfriend, who's been dropping the kid off to get back at him. The parents are taking over most of the parenting, and the brother isn't helping. There are incidents like swearing in front of the child, leaving her unattended, playpen time for hours, and the child injuring herself. The baby momma also uses the child for Instagram and to mess with the brother. The siblings are bitter, and after the CPS report, the younger brother is upset, thinking their dad did it.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal and ethical aspects. Reporting child neglect is typically a legal responsibility in many places. If someone has reasonable cause to believe a child is being neglected or abused, they can report it without being a family member. The author did report it, which could be seen as a responsible action to protect the child. But there's a debate here about family dynamics and whether the report was necessary or if there were other ways to handle it.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is part of the family. Maybe they could have tried to mediate or find other solutions before involving CPS. However, the situation seems dire: the child is being left in possibly unsafe conditions, and the parents are stepping in, but the mother's behavior is problematic. The ex is using the child as a weapon in their fight. The brother isn't contributing, and the child is being neglected in various ways. \n\nCPS exists for situations like this, where a child's well-being is at risk. The author might feel that their actions were necessary to prevent further harm. However, the fallout within the family is significant. The brother is upset, and the author is staying silent about being the one who reported, which might add to the conflict. But lying or not disclosing who did it could be seen as unethical, even if the action was right.\n\nThe key factors are the child's safety and the necessity of the report. If there's clear evidence of neglect, the report is justified. The brother might be upset because the family is dealing with it themselves, but if the situation is as bad as described, CPS intervention could be warranted. The author's intent was to protect the child, which is a valid reason. So, even though family relations are affected, the primary duty is to the child's safety. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
