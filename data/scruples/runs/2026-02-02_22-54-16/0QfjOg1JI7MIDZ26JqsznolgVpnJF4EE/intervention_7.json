For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. The situation involves the brother having a child at 17, and both he and the mother are neglecting the child. The brother isn't helping, and the mother is using the child as a weapon between them. The parents are taking over, but the author reported it to CPS. The brother is angry and thinks the dad did it.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did the right thing. The key here is the neglect of the child. Leaving a 16-month-old unattended, swearing in front of her, injuries from not being watched properly\u2014those are red flags. Reporting suspected child neglect is a legal obligation in many places. The author might be a mandated reporter, and even if not, they have a moral duty to protect the child.\n\nBut there's also the family dynamics. The brother is a minor (17 when the child was born, so maybe 19 now?), and the mother is unstable. The author's parents are involved, stepping in. The author chose to report after talking to their dad. Now the brother is angry, thinking the dad reported. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for reporting.\n\nThe possible arguments against the author could be that they shouldn't have meddled in family matters, or that they should have given the brother more chances. However, the well-being of the child is paramount. If there's neglect, reporting is the right action. The author might not be in the wrong here. Also, not reporting would have been a problem if the child was in danger.\n\nAnother angle: CPS involvement is necessary when there's a risk to the child. The examples given (leaving the child unattended, injuries) suggest neglect. So reporting is appropriate. The author isn't in the wrong for acting in the child's best interest. Also, staying silent and not taking action could be complicit in neglect. So the answer is B.\n"
