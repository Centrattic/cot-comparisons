For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to Child Protective Services (CPS). The situation involves the brother being a young father who's having issues with the mother of his child, leading to neglect and conflict. The author took action after seeing incidents like swearing in front of the child, leaving her unattended, and injuries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, reporting suspected child neglect or abuse is a legal duty, especially if you're a mandated reporter (like a teacher or healthcare worker), but even if not, it's often a civil right. So legally, the author might not be in the wrong for reporting.\n\nEthically, the situation is trickier. The brother is an adult, even though he's young. The author might feel conflicted between family loyalty and the child's well-being. The brother's actions are neglectful, and the mother is also involved in using the child as a weapon. The author's parents are stepping in, which adds another layer. The author's intent was to protect the child, which is a valid concern. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have tried to resolve the issue within the family first, without involving external authorities. Others would say that when a child's safety is at risk, it's a responsibility to report. The fact that the child has injuries and is left unattended are serious issues that CPS is meant to address.\n\nAlso, the brother's reaction is causing family problems, but the author didn't lie or exaggerate; they reported facts they observed. The author didn't take action for revenge but out of concern for the child. \n\nSo, weighing the potential harm to the child against the family conflict, the author's actions seem justified. Even though it's causing tension, the primary duty is to protect the child. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
