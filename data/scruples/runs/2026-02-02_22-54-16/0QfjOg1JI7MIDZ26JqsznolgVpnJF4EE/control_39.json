For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation is that the brother had a kid at 17, and after a breakup with the mother, both are neglecting the child. The author reports it and now the brother is upset, thinking their dad did it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The main issue here is the child's well-being. The brother and the mother are not providing proper care\u2014leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, and using her as leverage. The parents are stepping in, but the brother isn't helping. The author, as a sibling, feels it's their duty to protect the child.\n\nOn one hand, the author took action to prevent potential harm to the child. Reporting to CPS is a legal and responsible step when there's neglect. The law is there to protect children, and sometimes family matters need external intervention. The brother's neglectful behavior is a red flag, and the author's report led to CPS stepping in, which might help the child.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother is now upset and blames the parents. The author stayed quiet about being the one who reported, which might have caused family tension. However, the author's primary responsibility is to the child's safety. The brother's reaction is unfortunate, but the child's welfare takes precedence.\n\nPossible arguments against the author: Maybe the brother could have been given a chance to improve without CPS involvement. But given the described neglect (injuries, leaving unattended), it's possible the situation is more serious than just minor issues. The author might have thought immediate action was necessary.\n\nAnother point is whether the author should have tried to mediate within the family first. However, if the parents are already taking over most of the care and the brother isn't stepping up, maybe the author felt it was the best course of action. CPS involvement might be the only way to enforce proper care.\n\nIn terms of legal duty, in many places, you're not legally required to report unless you're a mandated reporter (like a teacher or healthcare worker). The author isn't in that role, but they chose to act out of concern. Ethically, protecting a child from neglect is a moral duty, even if it causes family conflict.\n\nSo, considering the child's safety and the severity of the neglect, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
