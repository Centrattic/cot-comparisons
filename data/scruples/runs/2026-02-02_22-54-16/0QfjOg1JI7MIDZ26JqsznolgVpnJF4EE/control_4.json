For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the brother became a parent at 17, which is young. He was doing okay at first but after a breakup with the baby's mom, things went downhill. Both parents are using the kid as leverage against each other, and there's neglect. The brother isn't helping, and the mom is dropping the kid off unexpectedly, leading to stress. The author reported this to CPS after talking to their dad. Now, the brother is upset, and the family is blaming the dad.\n\nThe key points here are the child's safety and well-being. The neglect described\u2014swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, not supervising leading to injuries\u2014could be signs of neglect. CPS steps in when there's a risk to the child. The author's action is based on concern for the child, even if it's a family matter. \n\nIn many places, people are legally obligated to report suspected child abuse or neglect. So the author might be doing the right thing by fulfilling that duty. However, the brother might feel betrayed, but the main issue is the child's welfare. The author didn't act out of spite but because they saw serious issues. The brother's reaction is understandable but the priority should be the child's safety. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They took action to protect the child, which is the right thing to do even if it caused family conflict.\n"
