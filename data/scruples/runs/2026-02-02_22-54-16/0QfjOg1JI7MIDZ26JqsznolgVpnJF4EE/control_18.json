For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation involves a 17-year-old brother who's a father, and there's neglect happening with the child. The brother and the mother are using the kid as a weapon against each other. The user reported it to CPS, and now their brother is upset, thinking their dad did it. The question is whether the user is the asshole for reporting or for staying silent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Child neglect is a serious issue. If a child is being left unattended, exposed to swearing, and injured, that's a red flag. Reporting to CPS is a legal duty in many places because the safety of the child is paramount. The user's actions were taken to protect the child, which is a morally right thing to do. \n\nThen, there's the family dynamics. The brother is 17 and already a parent, which is tough. The user might feel conflicted because they're family. But the child's well-being should come first. The brother's reaction is understandable but doesn't make the reporter wrong. The user didn't act out of spite but out of concern for the child.\n\nThe other part is staying silent. If the user had stayed quiet, the neglect might continue, which could be even worse. So, choosing to report was the responsible action. \n\nThere's also the aspect of confidentiality. CPS requires reporters to be confidential, so the user didn't have to reveal themselves as the reporter. The brother's anger is directed at the dad, which might be because he's the only other person involved in the conversation. But the user's decision to report was justified.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because protecting the child from neglect is the right action, even if it causes family conflict. The user acted in the best interest of the child, which is the priority here.\n"
