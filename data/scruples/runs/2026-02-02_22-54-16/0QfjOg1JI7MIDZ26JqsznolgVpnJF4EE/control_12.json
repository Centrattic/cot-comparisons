For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The question is whether the author is an asshole (AITA) for doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The brother became a father at 17, had a breakup with the baby's mom, and both are neglecting the child. Examples given include swearing in front of the kid, leaving her unattended, playpen time leading to injuries, and the parents taking over. The author reported to CPS, and now the brother is upset, thinking the dad did it.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were justified. The user wants to know if the author is wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nCPS is supposed to step in when there's neglect or abuse. The described neglect includes leaving the child unattended, not supervising leading to injuries, and exposing her to a harmful environment. The author felt it was necessary to protect the child, even if it caused family conflict. However, the brother is a minor (17), which might complicate things. But the duty to protect a child from harm is a legal and moral obligation. The author, as a family member, might be within their right to report. \n\nBut wait, if the brother is an adult, even though he's 17, he's an adult in some states. However, the child in question is 16 months old, so the neglect is towards the daughter. The author's concern is valid if the child is being harmed. Reporting to CPS is a standard action in such cases. The brother's reaction is understandable but maybe not justified if the neglect is real. The author chose to act to protect the child, which is a positive action. The fact that they didn't reveal themselves might be to avoid conflict, which is common in family dynamics. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
