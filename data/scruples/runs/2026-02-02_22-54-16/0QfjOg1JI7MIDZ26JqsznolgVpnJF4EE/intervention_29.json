For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation involves the brother becoming a parent at 17, then having issues with the baby's mother, leading to neglect and arguments. The author decided to report CPS because of neglect incidents like swearing in front of the child, leaving her unattended, injuries, and the parents not helping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, mandatory reporters (like teachers, doctors) have to report child neglect or abuse. But are family members also considered mandatory reporters? I think in some states, they are. If that's the case, the author might have a legal obligation. Even if not, anyone can report concerns to CPS to protect a child.\n\nEthically, the main issue is whether the author is justified in taking this action. The brother is neglecting his daughter, and the mother is using the child as leverage. The parents are stepping in, but it's not enough. The author is concerned about the child's safety and well-being. Reporting CPS is a proactive step to prevent harm.\n\nHowever, the brother is upset and thinks it's their dad, causing family tension. The author stayed quiet about being the one who reported, which might be seen as lying by omission. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for reporting. The key is whether the neglect is real and the author acted in the child's best interest.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The author might be overstepping family matters, or perhaps CPS intervention is too harsh. But given the described neglect (leaving the child unattended, injuries, playpen for hours), it seems like a legitimate concern. The brother is not fulfilling his parental duties, so CPS involvement could be necessary.\n\nSo, the answer likely is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They acted to protect the child's welfare, which is a higher priority than family loyalty in this case.\n"
