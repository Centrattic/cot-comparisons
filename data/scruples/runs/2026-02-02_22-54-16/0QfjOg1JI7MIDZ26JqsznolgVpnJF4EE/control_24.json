For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation is that the brother had a kid at 17, and now both him and the mother are neglecting the child. The sister reported them, leading to CPS involvement, and now the brother is upset, thinking it was their dad.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The brother and the mother are neglecting the child in various ways: swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, injuries, and using the child as leverage in their fights. The parents are stepping in, but the brother isn't helping. The sister reported them to protect the child.\n\nFrom a legal and ethical standpoint, CPS exists to protect children from neglect and abuse. If there's credible evidence of neglect, reporting is a responsible action. The sister might be justified in her actions because the child's safety is at risk. However, maybe she could have tried other avenues first, like family mediation or support groups. But given the severity\u2014like the child getting injured\u2014it might be necessary to involve authorities.\n\nThe brother is upset because he feels betrayed, but the sister's priority was the child's well-being. Whether she's in the wrong depends on the situation. If the neglect is real and imminent, reporting is the right thing. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no other angle. Did she have a duty to inform them first? Not necessarily, especially if the child is in immediate danger. So, B seems correct.\n"
