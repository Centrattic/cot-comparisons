For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. The situation is that the brother had a kid with an unstable girl when he was 17, and after a breakup, both he and the mother are neglecting the child. The author reported it, and now the brother is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, mandatory reporting laws require certain people to report suspected child abuse or neglect. Even if you're not a professional, like a family member, you might still be encouraged to report if you believe a child is in danger. The user here is a sibling, so they might not be a mandatory reporter, but their actions are still protected as they're acting in the child's best interest.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The child is being neglected, left unattended, exposed to swearing, and even injured. The parents (brother and ex) are not providing proper care. The grandparents are stepping in. The author's decision to report is to protect the child from harm. Even if the brother is upset, the child's safety is paramount.\n\nAnonymity in reporting is another point. The author stayed quiet about being the one who reported, which could be seen as protecting the situation and not causing more conflict. But the brother is now blaming the dad, which is causing family issues. However, the author's main duty is to the child, not the brother's feelings.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should have tried to resolve it within the family first. But the neglect is ongoing and severe. The brother isn't stepping up, and the mother is using the child as a weapon. The author might not have the authority to force them to change. Reporting to CPS is a legal and responsible action when a child's safety is at risk.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is acting in the child's best interest. They're not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
