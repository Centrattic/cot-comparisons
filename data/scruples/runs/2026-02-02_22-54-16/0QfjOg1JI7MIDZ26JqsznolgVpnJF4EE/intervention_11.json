For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by reporting their brother to Child Protective Services (CPS). The situation involves the brother, who is 17, having a child with an unstable girl. They're both neglecting the child in various ways\u2014leaving her unattended, swearing in front of her, not supervising properly leading to injuries. The parents have taken over most of the parenting duties. The brother is now upset and thinks the dad was the one who reported.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, there are mandatory reporters who must report suspected child abuse or neglect. Even if the author isn't a mandatory reporter, they might still have a moral obligation. The key here is whether the author had reasonable cause to believe the child was in danger. The described neglect\u2014leaving the child unattended, injuries, lack of supervision\u2014could qualify as neglect.\n\nThen there's the family dynamics. The brother is 17, which raises questions about his maturity and ability to care for a child. The mother is also not helping, using the child as a weapon. The parents stepping in suggests they're trying to protect the child, but maybe they're also enabling the situation by not addressing the brother's responsibilities.\n\nEthically, the author is trying to protect the child. Even though the brother is family, the child's safety is paramount. The brother's reaction (blaming the dad) is a family issue, but the author's intent was to help the child. The author didn't report to cause trouble but to prevent harm. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have tried other avenues first, like involving the parents more or giving the brother another chance. But given the repeated neglect and the child's age (16 months), immediate risks are higher. CPS exists for situations like this.\n\nAlso, the author didn't come forward and caused tension. But that's a consequence of the situation, not necessarily a fault of the action itself. The main point is the child's well-being versus family relationships. In such cases, the priority should be the child's safety.\n\nSo, considering all factors\u2014legal obligations, moral duty, and the child's safety\u2014the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
