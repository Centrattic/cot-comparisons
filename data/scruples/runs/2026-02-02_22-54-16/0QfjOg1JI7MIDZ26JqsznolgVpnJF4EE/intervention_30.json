For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. The situation involves a 17-year-old brother who became a father after a breakup, and both him and the mother are neglecting the child. The author reported this to CPS because the child is being left unattended, exposed to swearing, and even injured. The parents are stepping in, but the brother isn't helping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, you can report suspected child abuse or neglect to CPS, and you can do so anonymously. The author's actions might be legally justified since they're trying to protect the child. But then there's the family dynamic. The brother is upset, thinking the dad reported him, which is causing family tension. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author's intentions matter. They wanted to protect the child from neglect and harm. The brother's actions, like leaving the kid in a playpen for hours and not helping, combined with the mother's behavior, do seem to meet the criteria for neglect. The child's safety is the priority here. \n\nHowever, the author didn't step in directly before reporting. Maybe they could have tried to help the brother first, like offering support or getting counseling. But given the situation, maybe the neglect was too severe for that. Also, the brother was 17 when the child was born, which might affect his maturity and ability to handle parenting responsibilities. \n\nThe question is whether the author's actions were wrong. Since the author's intent was to protect the child, and the actions they described (swearing in front of the child, leaving unattended, injuries) are indicators of neglect, reporting to CPS is a responsible action. The brother's anger is understandable but doesn't make the author wrong. \n\nSo, considering the child's welfare and the legal duty to report suspected neglect, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
