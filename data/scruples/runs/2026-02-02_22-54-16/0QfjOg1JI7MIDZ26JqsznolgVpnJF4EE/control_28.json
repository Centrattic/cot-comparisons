For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author reported their brother to Child Protective Services (CPS) because they believed the brother was neglecting his daughter. The brother is 17 and has a child with an unstable girl. After the breakup, both the mother and brother are using the child as a weapon against each other. The author describes specific instances of neglect: swearing in front of the child, leaving her unattended, putting her in a playpen while he plays games, and the child injuring herself multiple times. The parents are now taking over most of the parenting, and the brother isn't helping. The author reported this to CPS, and now the brother is upset, thinking it was their dad who did it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, if you suspect child neglect or abuse, you have a legal duty to report it. CPS investigations are usually confidential, so the brother might not know who reported them. The author did the right thing legally by reporting the neglect. \n\nEthically, the author is trying to protect a child from potentially harmful situations. The brother is a minor himself, which might complicate things. However, the child's safety is the priority. The neglect described\u2014leaving the child unattended, not supervising leading to injuries\u2014could be serious. The author's actions might prevent further harm.\n\nBut there's also the family dynamic to consider. The brother might feel betrayed by the author, which is understandable. However, the author's silence could lead to the child being harmed more. The brother's behavior is neglectful, and the author is taking a difficult step to intervene.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author reported based on valid concerns of neglect, acted within their legal rights, and aimed to protect the child. The brother's reaction is part of the fallout, but the author isn't in the wrong for taking action to safeguard the child. Therefore, the answer is likely B (Not the asshole).\n"
