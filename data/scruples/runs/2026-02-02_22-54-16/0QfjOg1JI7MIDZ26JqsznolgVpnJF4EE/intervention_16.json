For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to child protective services. The situation involves the brother being a teenager when he had a child, and since a breakup, both he and the mother are neglecting the child. The author reports to CPS, leading to family tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, there are mandatory reporters laws that require people to report suspected child neglect or abuse. If the author is in such a category (like a family member), they might have a legal obligation. Also, the child's well-being is a key factor here. The described neglect\u2014leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, injuries\u2014could be signs of neglect. \n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author is trying to protect the child, which is a valid concern. However, the brother might feel betrayed, but the author's priority is the child's safety. The author's decision to report could be seen as a responsible action to prevent harm. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should have tried other avenues first, like involving other family members or community resources. But given the situation is already affecting the parents, and the neglect is ongoing, waiting might not be safe for the child. \n\nAlso, the brother's reaction and the family dynamics complicate things. The author didn't disclose being the one who reported, which might add to the brother's frustration. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is the child's safety versus family loyalty. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author's action seems justified to protect the child. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
