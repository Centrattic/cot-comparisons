For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation involves the brother being a minor when he had a kid and then not properly caring for the child. The baby's mom is also acting out, dropping the kid off unannounced, and both are neglecting the child. The parents are now taking over most of the parenting. The author reported to CPS, and now the brother is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The brother is 17, so he's a minor himself. Minors having children face unique challenges, and neglect is a serious issue. CPS steps in when there's abuse or neglect. The author observed several instances: swearing in front of the kid, leaving her unattended, injuries, and the parents taking over. Reporting these to CPS is a way to protect the child, especially since both the father and mother are acting irresponsibly.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother might feel betrayed by his sibling. But the main concern here is the child's safety. The author's actions were to prevent harm to the niece. The brother's reaction is understandable, but the author's intent was to help. Also, staying silent might mean the child continues to be neglected. Reporting is the right thing to do when a child is in danger. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
