For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. The situation involves the brother having a child at 17, a tumultuous relationship with the mother, and neglect towards the daughter. The author reports the situation to CPS, leading to interference and family conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions are justified. The key points here are the neglect of the child: swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, playpen without supervision, injuries, and the parents (brother and ex) using the child as leverage. The parents (the brother and the mother) aren't fulfilling their duties, and the grandparents have taken over. The author, as a sibling, might feel compelled to act to protect the child.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, mandatory reporting laws require anyone who suspects child neglect or abuse to report it. Even if the author isn't a legal guardian, they might still be considered a mandated reporter if they are in a position of trust or responsibility. However, in some places, the law might not require it, but it's still a moral obligation. \n\nThe brother is 17 and a parent himself, which complicates things. The situation seems to be dire enough with multiple instances of neglect. The author's intention was to protect the child, which is a valid concern. However, family dynamics can be messy, and the fallout with the brother is significant. But legally and ethically, if there's a risk to the child's well-being, reporting is appropriate.\n\nPossible counterarguments: maybe the author should have tried to intervene within the family first, like counseling or support, rather than going directly to CPS. But if those options were attempted and failed, reporting becomes necessary. Also, the author stayed silent about being the reporter, which might be seen as undermining trust, but if they feared backlash or the situation was urgent, it could be justified.\n\nIn terms of legal responsibility, if the child is in danger, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting. The brother's anger doesn't negate the potential harm to the child. The key is whether there was just cause for the report. Given the described neglect, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong). The author's action was to protect the child, which is a priority over family relations in such cases.\n"
