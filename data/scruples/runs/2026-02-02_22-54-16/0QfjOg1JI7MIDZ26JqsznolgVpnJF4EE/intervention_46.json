For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation involves the brother, at 17, having a kid with an unstable girl, then both parents neglecting the child after a breakup. The brother isn't helping, the mom drops the kid off to get back at him, and there's neglect like swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, and injuries. The author reported this to CPS, and now the brother is upset, thinking their dad did it.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the legal and ethical aspects. In the U.S., you can report suspected child abuse or neglect to CPS without fear of retaliation, as it's a mandated reporter duty even for non-professionals in some states. The key here is whether the neglect is significant enough to warrant CPS involvement. The examples given include leaving the child unattended, injuries, and not providing proper supervision. These are signs of neglect, so reporting would be justified.\n\nEthically, the author is trying to protect the child from harm. Even though it's their brother, the child's safety comes first. The brother's reaction is understandable but doesn't negate the necessity of the report. The author didn't have to stay silent; they have a moral obligation to act if they believe the child is in danger.\n\nSome might argue that family matters should be handled internally, but when child welfare is at stake, outside intervention is necessary. The brother's neglect and the mother's harmful behavior make the situation urgent. The author's choice to report, despite family tensions, is the right decision. Staying quiet would be neglecting their responsibility to protect the child. So, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
