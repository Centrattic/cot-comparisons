For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about their younger brother being a 17-year-old father who's not handling his responsibilities well. The brother and the baby's mother are both using the child as a way to get back at each other, which sounds really bad. They're neglecting the kid in various ways: leaving her alone, swearing in front of her, not watching her properly leading to injuries, and so on. The parents are stepping in to take care of the child, but the brother isn't helping. The author decided to report this to Child Protective Services (CPS), which caused conflict because the brother is angry and thinks their dad did it.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did the right thing by reporting CPS or not. Let's break it down. The key factors here are the well-being of the child and the legal/ethical duty to report neglect or abuse. In many places, you're legally required to report suspected child neglect or abuse. The author is a sibling, and even if they're not a legal guardian, they might still be a mandated reporter or have a moral obligation to protect the child.\n\nThe brother is 17, which is underage in many jurisdictions, and having a child already shows some responsibility, but the behavior described\u2014leaving the child unattended, not providing proper care, using the child in conflicts with the mother\u2014points to neglect. The mother's actions are also problematic, like dropping off the child without notice and taking the kid for Instagram photos, which could be seen as exploiting the child.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they're trying to protect the child from harm. Reporting to CPS is a way to ensure that the child is in a safe environment. The brother is upset because he feels betrayed, but the author's actions were aimed at preventing further harm to the child. The author also stayed quiet about being the one who reported, which might be to avoid more conflict, but that's a separate issue from the initial decision to report.\n\nConsidering that the neglect is ongoing and the child is at risk, the author likely did the right thing by reporting. The brother's anger is unfortunate, but the child's safety is paramount. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
