For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation involves the brother having a child at 17, going through a breakup, and both he and the ex are neglecting the child. The brother isn't helping much, and the ex is using the child as a way to get back at him. The parents are stepping in, but the author took the step to report to CPS, which caused tension in the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, it's mandatory to report suspected child neglect or abuse. If the author observed specific instances like leaving the child unattended, injuries, and inappropriate behavior around the child, then reporting might be their duty. The brother's reaction is understandable, but the child's safety is paramount.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a nuance. Did the author have enough evidence? Did they try to resolve it within the family first? The scenario mentions that parents are already involved, so maybe the author felt they needed to escalate. Also, the brother's neglect is clear, and the mother's behavior is harmful. The author's intention was to protect the child, which is a valid reason.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have consulted with parents more or tried other interventions before reporting. But given the severity of the neglect (injuries, leaving in a playpen for hours), it's a valid concern. The author isn't in the wrong for acting to protect the child, even if it caused family conflict. So the answer is B.\n"
