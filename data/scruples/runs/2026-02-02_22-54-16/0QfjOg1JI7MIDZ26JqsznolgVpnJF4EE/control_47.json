For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who reported their brother to child protective services (CPS) is in the wrong. The situation is that the brother became a parent at 17, had a rocky relationship with the baby's mother, and now both are neglecting the child. The brother isn't helping, the mother is using the child as a weapon, and the parents are stepping in. The person reported CPS, and now the brother is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Reporting child neglect is a serious matter. In many places, it's actually a legal duty to report suspected child abuse or neglect. So if there's evidence of neglect, like leaving the child unattended, not supervising leading to injuries, and swearing around the child, then reporting could be justified. The person might be in the right because they're protecting the child's well-being.\n\nBut then again, maybe there's a family dynamic here. The brother is young and might be struggling, but the sister stepped in. However, the brother's neglect is affecting the child. The sister's decision to report might be seen as overstepping, but if the child's safety is at risk, it's a different story. Also, staying silent could mean allowing the child to be in a harmful environment. The sister had a reason to act, especially if she witnessed the incidents and discussed it with her dad first.\n\nAnother angle: confidentiality. The sister didn't tell anyone she was the one who reported it. If others are now blaming the dad, it might cause family conflict. But the sister's responsibility was to protect the child, not necessarily to reveal her role unless asked. So maybe she's not in the wrong for staying quiet.\n\nBut wait, could there be a better way? Like intervening without CPS? Maybe, but if the neglect is severe and ongoing, CPS is the right step. The sister might have done the right thing by law and ethics. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
