For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS.\n\nFirst, the situation: The brother had a kid at 17, went through a bad breakup, and both he and the mother are neglecting the child. There's swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, playpen incidents, injuries. Parents are stepping in, brother isn't helping. The author reported to CPS, causing family tension.\n\nSo, the main points here. The author's intent was to protect the child from neglect. The brother is 17, which is a minor in many places, so maybe his capacity to care for a child is limited. The neglect includes things that could be considered endangerment. The author did report, which led to CPS involvement. The brother is upset because he thinks their dad did it. The author is staying quiet about being the reporter.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, CPS exists to protect children. If there's credible evidence of neglect, reporting is the right thing to do. The author's actions are aimed at protecting a vulnerable child. Even if it caused family conflict, the priority should be the child's safety. The brother's reaction is understandable but doesn't justify the neglect. The author isn't in the wrong for acting in the child's best interest. Also, they stayed quiet to avoid conflict, which is a personal choice but not necessarily wrong in this context. So, answer B.\n"
