For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. The situation involves the brother having a child at 17, a tumultuous relationship with the mother, and subsequent issues with the child's care.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Reporting suspected child abuse or neglect to Child Protective Services (CPS) is a legal requirement in many places. If there's evidence of neglect, like leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, and injuries, then reporting is not only a right but a duty to protect the child.\n\nThe brother is 17, and the baby's mother is described as unstable. They're using the child as leverage against each other, which is harmful. The parents are stepping in, but the brother isn't contributing. The key points here are the neglectful behaviors and the fact that the child is being used as a tool in their conflict.\n\nThe author's actions are based on concern for the child's well-being. While it's causing family tension, the primary responsibility is to ensure the child's safety. The author might have a duty to report, and staying silent could be seen as neglecting that duty. The brother's anger is a consequence of his actions, not the reporter's.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of family privacy and the potential fallout. But given the circumstances, the child's welfare takes precedence. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
