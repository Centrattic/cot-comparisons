For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe brother had a kid at 17 with an unstable girl. They're both neglecting the child: not watching her enough, swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, even causing injuries. The parents are stepping in because the brother isn't helping. The sister reports it to CPS, and now the brother is upset, thinking the dad did it. The sister is conflicted about staying quiet.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the child's safety and well-being. The neglect includes leaving the child alone, injuries, and exposure to abuse. Those are serious issues. CPS exists to protect children from such situations. Reporting it is a legal and ethical responsibility to prevent harm.\n\nThe brother and the mother might not be in the right here. Even though they're family, the sister's duty to protect the child overrides her familial ties. She's acting in the child's best interest. Also, she took the step after discussing with her dad, which shows she tried to address it within the family first before involving authorities.\n\nThe brother's reaction is understandable but doesn't justify the neglect. The sister's silence could lead to more harm. She's not the asshole for reporting; she's preventing potential abuse or worse. Also, staying quiet after seeing repeated incidents would be complicit. The main issue is the brother's and mother's actions, not her reporting.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No) because she's protecting the child, which is the right thing to do. Even if it causes family tension, the priority is the child's safety.\n"
