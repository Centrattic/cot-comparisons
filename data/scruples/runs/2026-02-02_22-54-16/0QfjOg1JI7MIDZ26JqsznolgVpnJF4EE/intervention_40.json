For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation is complicated because the brother is a teenager with a child, and both he and the mother seem to be neglecting the child. The author reported them, which led to CPS involvement, and now the brother is upset, thinking their dad did it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, if someone has reasonable cause to believe a child is being neglected or abused, they are legally required to report it. So the author might be doing their duty here. The brother is 17, which is under the age of majority in many states, and he's not providing proper care. The mother is also acting irresponsibly, dropping the kid off without notice and taking her for social media. The child is getting injured and left alone. \n\nBut then there's the family dynamics. The author's parents are already stepping in, which might have been a first step. However, if the neglect continues, reporting could be necessary. The brother is upset and blaming their dad, but the author did report it. The question is whether the author overstepped or was justified.\n\nOn one hand, protecting the child is paramount. If the child's safety is at risk, reporting is the right thing. On the other hand, maybe the author could have tried to mediate first or get more support before going to CPS. But given the severity of the neglect, maybe they had no choice. The answer probably leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the priority is the child's well-being.\n"
