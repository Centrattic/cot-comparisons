For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the brother had a kid young and is now in a bad situation with the mother. They both seem to be neglecting the child. The brother doesn't help with parenting, and the mother uses the kid for revenge. The parents are now taking over, but there's a lot of neglect happening. The author reports this to CPS, which leads to the brother being upset and blaming the dad.\n\nThe user's main question is whether the author is the asshole for reporting. They think the author isn't in the wrong, but want confirmation.\n\nI need to evaluate the ethical and legal aspects. Legally, in many places, you can report suspected child neglect as a mandatory reporter or as a concerned citizen. So the author might be doing the right thing legally. Ethically, it's more complicated. The brother is an adult, so there's a family dynamic here. The author might feel conflicted because it's their sibling, but the child's well-being is at stake.\n\nThe brother's actions\u2014leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, not helping out\u2014do sound like neglect. The mother's behavior is also problematic. The author's report led to CPS intervention, which is supposed to protect the child. Even though it's causing family tension, the child's safety is a priority.\n\nBut some might argue that the author should have tried other avenues first, like involving the parents or other family members. However, the parents are already stepping in, so maybe the author felt it wasn't enough. Also, there's the aspect of not revealing themselves as the reporter, which could be seen as avoiding conflict, but not necessarily wrong.\n\nIn terms of the answer, the options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). The key points here are the child's safety and the legal obligation to report. Since the author acted to protect a child, they're more in the right. The brother's reaction is understandable but doesn't negate the necessity of the report.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong. They took action to protect the child, which is a valid and responsible decision, even if it caused family issues.\n"
