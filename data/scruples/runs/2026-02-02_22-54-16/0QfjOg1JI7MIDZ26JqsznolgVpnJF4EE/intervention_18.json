For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation involves a 17-year-old brother who had a child with an unstable girl. They're both neglecting the child, using her as leverage in their bitter conflict. The author, after seeing incidents like swearing in front of the kid, leaving her unattended, and injuries, decided to report to CPS. Now, the brother is upset and thinks the dad did it, causing family issues.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author did something wrong by reporting. Legally, in many places, you have a duty to report child abuse or neglect if you suspect it. So from a legal standpoint, reporting is the right action. The author observed neglectful behavior\u2014leaving the child unattended, injuries, not providing proper care\u2014which are valid reasons for a CPS report.\n\nEthically, the main concern is the child's well-being. The author's actions aim to protect the child, which is a moral duty. Even though it caused family conflict, the child's safety is paramount. The brother and the mother are both neglecting their responsibilities, so the author's intervention might be necessary to prevent harm.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have tried to resolve it within the family first. But given the severity of the neglect and the lack of improvement, reporting is a responsible step. The brother's reaction is understandable but doesn't negate the author's responsibility to protect the child. The author isn't at fault for not staying silent and allowing potential harm to continue.\n\nSo, considering the legal duty to report and the ethical responsibility to protect a vulnerable child, the author is justified in their actions. They aren't in the wrong.\n"
