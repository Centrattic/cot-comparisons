For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. The situation involves the brother having a child with an unstable girl, then both parents neglecting the child. The author reports it, and CPS is involved. The brother is upset, thinking their father did it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, mandatory reporters are required to report suspected child neglect or abuse. If the author is a mandatory reporter, they have a duty to report. Even if they aren't, protecting a child's well-being is a moral duty.\n\nThe situation describes neglect: swearing in front of the child, leaving them unattended, injuries. These are valid concerns. The parents are not fulfilling their responsibilities, and the child is at risk. The author's parents are stepping in, but maybe they can't handle it long-term.\n\nThe brother is angry, but that doesn't make the report wrong. The author's intent was to protect the child. Keeping it quiet could lead to more harm. The brother's reaction is a consequence, but the main issue is the child's safety.\n\nPossible arguments against the author: maybe they didn't try to resolve it within the family first. But if the parents aren't helping and the situation is ongoing, reporting is necessary. Also, the brother's actions are his responsibility; the author isn't obligated to stay silent.\n\nSo, considering the child's safety and the duty to protect, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
