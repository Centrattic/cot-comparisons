For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. The brother became a parent at 17, had a bad breakup with the mom, and both neglect the child. The brother isn't helping, and the mom is using the kid as a weapon, leaving her alone, swearing in front of her, etc. The parents are now taking over, and the brother is angry.\n\nFirst, the key points: The child is being neglected. Neglect includes leaving a child unattended, exposing them to harmful environments (like swearing), and not supervising properly leading to injuries. The brother isn't fulfilling his parental duties. The sister reported this to CPS, which led to the brother being upset and family tension.\n\nLegally, in most places, you can report child neglect or abuse to CPS as a mandated reporter or as a concerned individual. The author isn't a parent or guardian, but they observed neglect. The main question is whether their actions were justified.\n\nOn one hand, the child's safety is paramount. CPS exists to protect children from harm. If the brother and the mother are neglecting the child, reporting it is a responsible action. The author might have been trying to help the child by intervening.\n\nOn the other hand, family dynamics can be complex. The brother might feel betrayed, and the author didn't confront the issue within the family first. However, in cases of ongoing neglect, waiting might put the child at risk. The author might have a duty to act if they believe the child is in danger.\n\nThe brother's reaction is understandable but doesn't excuse the neglect. The author's decision to stay silent about being the reporter could add to the tension, but the question is about whether reporting was wrong. Since the child is in immediate danger, the priority is the child's well-being. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting.\n"
