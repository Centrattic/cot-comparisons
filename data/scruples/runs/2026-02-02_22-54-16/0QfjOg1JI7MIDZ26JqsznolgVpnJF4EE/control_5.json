For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to Child Protective Services (CPS) is in the wrong. The situation involves the brother's unstable relationship, neglect of his child, and the mother's erratic behavior. The author's brother is 17 and not handling parenting duties, leading to the child being in a harmful environment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical responsibilities here. CPS is there to protect children from neglect and abuse. If the child is being left unattended, exposed to swearing, and has been injured due to neglect, then reporting this is a duty to ensure the child's safety. The brother's actions (or inactions) are contributing to a dangerous environment for the child.\n\nThe brother is a minor (17) and may not have the maturity or resources to handle parenting responsibilities effectively. The mother is also acting irresponsibly, using the child as a tool in their conflict. The parents taking over makes sense, but if the situation is still risky, reporting is necessary.\n\nThe author's motivation seems to be the child's well-being. They observed multiple incidents and, after discussing with their dad, took action. While it's causing family conflict, the primary responsibility is to protect the child. The brother's anger is unfortunate, but the reporter's intent is to prevent harm.\n\nPossible counterarguments might be about family privacy or the brother's right to parent. However, when a child's safety is compromised, reporting is legally mandated in many places. The author isn't in the wrong for fulfilling that responsibility. The question isn't about the family dynamics but the child's welfare. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
