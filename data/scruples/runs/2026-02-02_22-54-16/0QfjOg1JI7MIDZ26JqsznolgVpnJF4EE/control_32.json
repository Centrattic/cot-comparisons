For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. The situation is that the brother had a kid at 17, and both he and the mother are neglecting the child. The author reports it, causing family tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Child Protective Services (CPS) is an entity designed to protect children from abuse and neglect. If there's evidence of neglect\u2014like leaving the child unattended, exposure to swearing, injuries\u2014their role is to intervene. Reporting to CPS is a legal obligation for some people, like mandated reporters, but even for others, it's a moral choice to protect a child.\n\nThe brother's actions described here\u2014leaving the child in a playpen for hours, not watching her leading to injuries, and the mother dropping the kid off as revenge\u2014are clear signs of neglect. The author's parents are taking over, but the brother is not helping. The author's intent was to protect the child, which seems justified.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, reporting suspected abuse or neglect is not illegal. It's actually encouraged. Ethically, the priority is the child's well-being. The author might be facing family backlash, but that doesn't negate the right action. The brother's reaction is unfortunate, but the author isn't obligated to explain themselves if they're a confidential informant to CPS. However, staying silent could let the neglect continue, which is worse.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should have tried to resolve it within the family first. But if the situation is dangerous and the parents aren't helping, CPS is the appropriate step. Also, the brother's lack of cooperation and the mother's behavior make it clear that family intervention alone isn't enough.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The key points are protecting the child from neglect, fulfilling a moral duty, and the legal aspect of reporting.\n"
