For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. The situation involves the brother having a child at 17, a messy breakup with the mother, and both parents neglecting the child. The author reports this to CPS, leading to the brother being upset and blaming the parents.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. Child neglect is a serious issue. Leaving a child unattended, exposing them to swearing, and not providing proper supervision can all be signs of neglect. The brother isn't helping with parenting duties, and the mother is using the child as a weapon in their conflict. The parents are now taking over, but the question is whether the author did the right thing by reporting.\n\nLegally, any person can report suspected child abuse or neglect to CPS. The author had observed multiple instances that could indicate neglect, like leaving the child unattended, injuries, and inappropriate behavior around the child. Reporting these concerns is within their rights. The brother's reaction is emotional, but that doesn't make the report wrong. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of family dynamics. The author didn't inform their brother before reporting, which might have caused family tension. But the key is whether the child's safety was at risk. If there's a genuine concern for the child's well-being, the report was justified. Staying silent could harm the child, so the author isn't in the wrong for acting to protect the child. \n\nSo, considering both legal obligations and the child's welfare, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
