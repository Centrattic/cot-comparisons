For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. The brother had a kid at 17, and there's been a lot of issues with both him and the mom neglecting the child. The situation sounds really bad\u2014swearing in front of the kid, leaving her unattended, injuries, and the parents are fighting over custody. The author's parents are now taking care of the kid, but the brother isn't helping. The author reported it, and now the brother is upset, thinking the dad did it.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for reporting. On one hand, the brother is the legal guardian, and the kid is his responsibility. But the neglect is real, and CPS exists to protect children in such cases. The author might think they're doing the right thing by stepping in to protect the child. But family dynamics can be complicated. The brother might feel betrayed because it's a family matter, and the author stepped in. However, if the child's safety is at risk, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. CPS is there to intervene when there's neglect or abuse, even if it's a minor. The brother's actions could be putting the child in danger, so reporting is a responsible action to protect the child, even if it causes family conflict. The brother's reaction is unfortunate, but the priority should be the child's well-being. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
