For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the brother had a kid at 17 with an unstable girl. They broke up, and both are using the child as a weapon against each other. They neglect the child in various ways: swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, not supervising her properly leading to injuries. The parents are now taking over most parenting duties while the brother isn't helping. The author decided to report this to CPS, and the brother is upset, thinking the dad did it.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide if the answer is A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in the US, any citizen can report suspected child abuse or neglect. The obligation is there to protect the child. The author's actions could be seen as fulfilling that duty. The neglect described\u2014leaving the child unattended, injuries, being left in a playpen for hours, and exposure to swearing\u2014are all things CPS might consider as neglect. \n\nBut there's also family dynamics here. The author's brother is a parent, and the author stepping in might be seen as overstepping. However, if the child's well-being is at risk, the duty to protect overrides family ties. The brother's reaction is understandable but doesn't negate the possibility that the author did the right thing.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the law allows and even expects people to report suspected neglect, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting. The answer should be B. The brother's anger doesn't make the author right or wrong; it's about the action's justification. The neglect is present, and the author acted to protect the child. So B makes sense.\n"
