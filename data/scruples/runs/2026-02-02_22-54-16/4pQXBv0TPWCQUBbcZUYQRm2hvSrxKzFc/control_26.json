She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry at their friend who bought a dog despite her busy schedule. The situation involves a coworker with anxiety and trauma who got a therapy dog, but the author is upset because the dog will be left alone for long hours. The author made sarcastic comments and got reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from different angles. The coworker has a valid need for emotional support, and her ex's abuse is a significant trauma. Getting a therapy dog might be a legitimate way to help her cope. However, the author's concern about the dog's welfare is also valid. Leaving the dog alone for 14 hours a day is not ideal, and the dog's well-being is a concern.\n\nThe author's sarcastic comments, while perhaps expressing their frustration, were harsh and dismissive. Saying the dog should be given to someone who can care for it and comparing the dog to Netflix could be seen as insensitive. The coworker might have felt criticized in front of others, leading her to report the author to HR. The author's right to express their opinion is there, but the manner in which they did so was probably unprofessional and could be seen as harassment, depending on the workplace policies. \n\nThe outcome mentioned that the author came out as the villain, but others supported them. However, HR's role is to address the report, and the sarcasm likely contributed to the situation. The author's intention was to voice a concern, but the method was inappropriate. So, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but their approach was flawed. Considering the coworker's mental health and the context of her trauma, the author's comments could have been more empathetic. The key is whether the comments crossed the line into harassment. Since the coworker felt attacked, it's possible the author was in the wrong in how they expressed their concern.\n"
