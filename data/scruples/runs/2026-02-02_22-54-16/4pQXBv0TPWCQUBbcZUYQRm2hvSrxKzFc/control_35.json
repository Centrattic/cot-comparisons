She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a coworker got a dog for emotional support, but the author is upset because the dog is left alone for 14 hours a day. The author comments sarcastically about giving the dog to someone else and ends up getting reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They're concerned about the dog's welfare because it's being left alone so much and not properly trained. The coworker does work long hours and a long commute, so the dog's living conditions might be unethical if it's in a kennel for most of the day. The author's comments were sarcastic but maybe they were just voicing their concern in a poor way.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker has a valid reason for getting a therapy dog\u2014she's dealing with trauma and anxiety. Therapy animals can be important for mental health. The author's sarcastic remarks could have been hurtful, even if they were based on concern. The coworker might have felt that the author was undermining her emotional support needs, which led her to report the comment as harassment. \n\nNow, considering HR's role, they probably need to take all harassment claims seriously. The author's comment, while made in frustration, might be seen as a personal attack on the coworker's decision, even if it was about the dog. The coworker could feel targeted, especially if others aren't voicing similar concerns. The author's comment might have been inappropriate in a professional setting, regardless of intent. \n\nBut then, there's the aspect of animal welfare. If the dog is indeed being neglected, maybe the author had a valid point. However, the way the author expressed it was unprofessional. They might have been better off discussing it privately with the coworker or escalating it through proper channels if they were really concerned, rather than making sarcastic remarks that led to a conflict.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author had a concern but expressed it in a harmful way, leading to a harassment report. The coworker's needs are valid, but the author's method of addressing the issue was flawed. The author might not be entirely in the wrong about the dog's treatment, but their approach definitely contributed to the problem. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because their sarcastic comment was unprofessional and led to harassment charges, even if their intent was to raise a concern.\n"
