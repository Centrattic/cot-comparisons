She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry at their friend for buying a dog. The situation is that the coworker, who has a history of trauma and anxiety, got a dog. The author is upset because the coworker works long hours, so the dog is left alone a lot. The author made sarcastic comments about the dog's situation, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the facts. The coworker has a legitimate reason for needing emotional support. Getting a therapy dog is a common recommendation for people with anxiety. However, the coworker's work schedule makes it difficult to properly care for the dog, leading to the dog being in a kennel most of the time. The author is concerned about the dog's welfare.\n\nThe author's comments were sarcastic and critical, suggesting giving the dog away or using Netflix instead. This could be seen as dismissive of the coworker's emotional needs and the purpose of the therapy dog. However, the author's concern might be valid if the dog is not being properly cared for.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's intentions versus the impact of their words. While the author might have a point about the dog's welfare, the way they expressed it was sarcastic and potentially hurtful. The coworker felt attacked, leading to HR involvement. Even though the author's concerns were about the dog's well-being, the method of expressing those concerns was inappropriate. The author should have addressed the issue privately and constructively rather than making public sarcastic remarks.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the coworker might need to consider if getting a dog was feasible given her work schedule. But the author's response was not the right approach. The author's sarcastic comments crossed a line, especially in a professional setting, leading to the HR issue. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for the way they handled their concerns rather than the concern itself.\n"
