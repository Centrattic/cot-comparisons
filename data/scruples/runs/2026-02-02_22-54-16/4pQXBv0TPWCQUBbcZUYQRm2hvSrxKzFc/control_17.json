She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about their coworker getting a dog despite having a busy schedule, leading to the dog being left alone a lot. The author got upset, made sarcastic comments, and was reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The coworker has a history of trauma and uses the dog for emotional support. The author is concerned about the dog's welfare, thinking it's being neglected. The author's comments, while maybe well-intentioned, were sarcastic and led to HR involvement. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, if the coworker has an emotional support animal, it might be a protected need. The author's comments could be seen as targeting the coworker's personal choice, especially if it's a legitimate support animal. However, there's also a concern about animal welfare here. \n\nBut the author expressed their opinion in a sarcastic way, which might have been harsh even if the concern was valid. The coworker reported the author for harassment, which is a serious accusation. The author's comments could be seen as undermining the coworker's mental health needs, even if the author thought the dog's treatment was bad. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have a valid point about the dog's living conditions. But they didn't address it constructively. Maybe they should have discussed it privately or suggested alternatives instead of making sarcastic remarks. \n\nSo, considering the situation, the author's intention was to express concern but did it in a way that was unprofessional and hurtful. The coworker's right to an emotional support animal is important, and the author's public, sarcastic comments crossed a line, leading to HR issues. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for handling the situation poorly, even if they had valid concerns.\n"
