She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a coworker who has a dog, and the author is upset about it. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, and the coworkers thought a dog would help. But the author is concerned because the coworker works long hours and the dog is alone most of the time. The author made sarcastic comments about the dog's situation, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They might feel that the dog isn't being properly cared for, especially since it's left alone for 14 hours a day. The author's comments were sarcastic and maybe a bit harsh, but their intention was to point out the problem. They were trying to be honest about the situation, right?\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker might feel that the author is being insensitive. The dog is supposed to be a therapy animal for her emotional support, so the author's remarks could come across as dismissive of her needs. Even if the author has valid concerns about the dog's welfare, the way they expressed it was inconsiderate and potentially hurtful. \n\nThe key points here are: the coworker's mental health, the dog's living conditions, and the author's method of communication. The author's comments led to HR involvement, which suggests that the workplace took the coworker's report seriously. Even if the author thought they were speaking up for the dog's well-being, using sarcasm and making jokes about the dog's care can be seen as unprofessional and offensive. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they were the only one to voice their concern, which might mean others were more supportive but didn't question the situation. The author's directness might have been well-intentioned, but the approach was problematic. In a professional setting, how you communicate is as important as what you say. Sarcastic remarks can easily be misinterpreted or seen as harassment, even if not intended. \n\nSo, while the author had concerns about the dog's welfare and the coworker's ability to care for it, the way they expressed those concerns was inappropriate. The coworker's emotional support needs shouldn't be dismissed, but the author's method of addressing the situation led to conflict. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because their approach was unprofessional and hurtful, even if their intention was to help.\n"
