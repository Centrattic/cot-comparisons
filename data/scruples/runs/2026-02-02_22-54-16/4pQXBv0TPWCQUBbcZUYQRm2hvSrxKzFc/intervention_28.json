She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry at their coworker who got a dog. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, and other coworkers encouraged her to get a therapy dog. The author is upset because the coworker works long hours, so the dog is alone most of the time. The author made sarcastic comments about the dog being mistreated, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker has emotional support needs, and the dog was recommended as a therapy animal. The author's concern is valid because dogs need proper care and attention, and being left alone 14 hours a day could be neglectful. However, the author expressed their concern in a sarcastic and dismissive manner, which might have come off as harsh or insensitive.\n\nThe coworker reported the author, possibly feeling attacked or misunderstood. The author's comments, while pointing out a real issue, might have been delivered in a way that was unkind, especially given the coworker's personal history. The author could have approached the situation more empathetically, perhaps by discussing the dog's care with the coworker rather than making snide remarks.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworkers who supported the dog purchase might not have considered the practical implications, such as the time required for training and care. The author's concern is legitimate but communicated poorly. The key is whether the author's comments crossed the line into harassment, which can depend on workplace policies and the intent behind the remarks.\n\nIn many cases, workplace harassment involves intent to humiliate or create a hostile environment. The author's sarcastic comment, while unkind, might be seen as a valid concern expressed in a poor manner. However, the coworker's sensitivity due to her trauma could make her more vulnerable to feeling targeted. The HR decision might hinge on whether the comment was a constructive concern or a personal attack.\n\nSo, the author isn't entirely in the wrong for having a valid concern, but the way they expressed it was inappropriate. They should have addressed it more constructively. Therefore, the answer is a balance between the validity of their concern and the method of communication. But since the question is whether they are in the wrong in the situation, the answer would lean towards B (No), as the author's intent was to highlight an issue, even if the delivery was poor.\n"
