She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a coworker getting a dog, which the author is upset about because the coworker works long hours and the dog is left alone most of the time. The author made sarcastic comments, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which might make getting a therapy dog seem like a good idea for her emotional support. However, the author is concerned about the dog's well-being, pointing out that the dog is alone for 14 hours a day and isn't getting proper training or care. The author's sarcastic remarks were meant to highlight the problem but came off as harsh and unkind.\n\nNow, the key points here are the author's intentions versus their delivery. The author's concern about the dog's welfare is valid because leaving a dog alone for long periods without proper care is a red flag. However, expressing those concerns in a sarcastic and dismissive manner, especially in a public or professional setting, can be seen as unprofessional and hurtful. The coworker might have felt attacked, and the author's comments could be perceived as mocking her therapy dog, which is meant to help her cope with trauma. \n\nIn a workplace environment, even if the author's intent was to point out a problem, the method of doing so through sarcasm and humor that belittles someone's therapeutic support could be considered unkind or even harassing, depending on the context. The fact that the coworker reported the author to HR and the author was initially seen as the villain suggests that the workplace values empathy and respectful communication. \n\nAdditionally, the author's comments about alternatives like Netflix might come off as minimizing the coworker's need for emotional support. While the author's concern for the dog is valid, the approach taken was inappropriate. The author should have addressed the issue more constructively, perhaps by discussing the matter privately and offering solutions rather than making sarcastic remarks. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't entirely in the wrong for having valid concerns about the dog's welfare, but the way they expressed those concerns was unprofessional and hurtful. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the coworker's actions (getting a dog for therapy) might be a personal choice and the author's response was inappropriate, the answer might lean towards the author being at fault for the way they handled it, not necessarily the concern itself.\n"
