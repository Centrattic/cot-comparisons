She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a coworker getting a dog despite having a long work schedule, and the author expressing frustration about the dog being left alone all day. The author made sarcastic comments which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which might make getting a therapy dog seem like a good idea for her. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being, but their approach was sarcastic and dismissive. The other coworkers supported the idea of the dog, possibly not considering the practical aspects.\n\nThe author's comments were harsh and could be seen as insensitive, especially in a professional setting. Even if they had valid concerns, using sarcasm and suggesting giving the dog away might come across as cruel or unempathetic. The coworker might feel that the author is undermining her emotional support needs, which can be a sensitive issue.\n\nHR involvement complicates things. The author's sarcastic remark was taken as harassment, which is a serious workplace issue. While the author might have had good intentions, the way they expressed their concerns was inappropriate. It's important to address issues respectfully, especially in a work environment where perceptions can lead to formal complaints.\n\nAlso, the author's coworkers seem to be on the coworker's side, which might reflect a lack of support for the author's perspective. However, the author's main point about the dog's welfare is valid. The problem here is balancing empathy for the coworker's emotional needs with the practical concerns of the dog's care.\n\nIn the end, while the author's concerns are understandable, the manner in which they were expressed was unprofessional and contributed to a hostile work environment. Even if the author didn't intend to harass, the comments were taken that way, leading to HR involvement. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because their approach was inappropriate despite the valid concerns.\n"
