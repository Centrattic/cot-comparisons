She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for getting angry at their friend over buying a dog. \n\nFirst, the situation: The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, and others thought getting a dog would help. The author is concerned because the coworker works long hours with a long commute, so the dog would be alone most of the time. The coworker isn't able to properly train the dog, leading to the dog being in a kennel most of the day and the kennel smelling. The author made a sarcastic comment about giving the dog to someone else, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nThe author's argument is that they were just pointing out a problem, but the coworker took offense and reported them. Now the author feels like they're the villain even though they think they're right.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the context. The coworker has legitimate emotional needs, and the dog was supposed to be a therapy animal. The author's concern is about the dog's well-being because it's left alone so much. The author's comment, while sarcastic, might have been a way to express frustration about the dog's treatment. However, the way they expressed it was harsh and could be seen as dismissive of the coworker's emotional needs, especially given her history. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe that the dog isn't being properly cared for. But using sarcasm and suggesting giving the dog away could come off as cruel, especially if the coworker is struggling with mental health. The coworker might perceive the comment as undermining her decision to get a therapy dog, which is meant to support her. \n\nThe author might not have considered the impact of their words on the coworker's mental health. Even if their intention was to highlight the dog's welfare, the method was inappropriate. The coworker was already in a vulnerable position, and the author's comment could be seen as attacking her ability to care for the dog, which is tied to her emotional support. \n\nIn a workplace setting, comments that could be seen as harassing or undermining someone's mental health support are taken seriously. Even if the author's intent was to help, the delivery led to a report, which HR would need to address. The author might have thought they were being honest, but in a professional environment, such sarcastic remarks can be harmful and lead to conflicts. \n\nSo, while the author's concerns about the dog's welfare are valid, the way they expressed their frustration was unprofessional and likely contributed to the coworker's distress. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility for the situation, even if their intention was to point out a problem.\n"
