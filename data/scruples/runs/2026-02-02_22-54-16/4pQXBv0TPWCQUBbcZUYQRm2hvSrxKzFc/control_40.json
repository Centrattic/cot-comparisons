She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker who got a dog for emotional support, but the author is upset because the dog is left alone for long hours and not properly trained, leading to problems like the kennel smelling. The author made sarcastic comments, which led to a report to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which the author acknowledges. The coworkers decided the dog would be good for her emotional support. The author is concerned about the dog's welfare because the coworker works long hours, leading to the dog being alone most of the time. The author's sarcastic remarks were about the dog's care and suggested giving it to someone else, which they found offensive and led to HR involvement.\n\nNow, evaluating the author's actions. While their concern about the dog's well-being is valid, the way they expressed it\u2014sarcasm and suggesting giving the dog away\u2014might have been inappropriate. Even if the author's intention was to highlight the problem, using sarcasm and making direct negative comments could be seen as unkind and potentially harassing, especially in a workplace. The coworker, who is already vulnerable due to past trauma, might have felt targeted. However, the author's comments were made in a casual context, perhaps in a group setting, which complicates whether it's harassment.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworkers who supported the dog choice didn't address the issue, and the author was the only one voicing a concern. The problem is that the author's method of expressing their concern might have been more harmful than the situation itself. The coworker might feel attacked, especially if the author's comments were dismissive of her emotional needs.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: The author had a valid concern about the dog's care, but the way they communicated it (sarcasm, suggesting giving the dog away) could be seen as unprofessional and hurtful, leading to HR involvement. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for their approach, even if their intentions were to help.\n"
