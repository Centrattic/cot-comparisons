She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry at their friend for buying a dog. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, and the dog is supposed to be a therapy animal. The author is concerned because the coworker works long hours and commutes a lot, so the dog would be alone most of the time. The author points out that the dog isn't getting proper attention and training because the coworker isn't home. They made a sarcastic comment suggesting giving the dog to someone else, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nHmm. The coworker's intent was to get a therapy dog for emotional support. But the author's comment was sarcastic and dismissive, which might have come across as harsh. Even if the author's concern was valid, the way they expressed it was probably not appropriate. Sarcastic remarks in the workplace can be seen as unprofessional and hurtful, especially if they undermine someone's decisions. Also, the coworker might feel that the author is judging her for her emotional needs. However, the coworker is the one getting the dog, and if the dog is indeed being neglected, maybe the author had a point, but the delivery was the issue. HR probably focuses on the method of communication rather than the content. So, the author might be in the wrong for how they expressed their concern rather than the concern itself.\n"
