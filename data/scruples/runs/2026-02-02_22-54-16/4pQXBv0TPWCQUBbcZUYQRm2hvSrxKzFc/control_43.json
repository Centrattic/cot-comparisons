She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a coworker getting a dog despite having a busy schedule, and the author expressing frustration about the dog's treatment. The author made sarcastic comments which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, and her coworkers thought a therapy dog would help. However, the author is concerned about the dog's welfare because the coworker is away for long hours, leading the dog to be in a kennel most of the time. The author's sarcastic remarks were aimed at highlighting this issue but came across as harsh. \n\nThe key points here are intent and method. The author's intention was to point out the problem with the dog's living conditions. However, the way they did it\u2014using sarcasm and making comments like suggesting giving the dog away or comparing it to Netflix\u2014might be seen as unkind, even if their concern was valid. The coworker felt attacked, and the author was reported. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author could have raised their concerns in a more constructive or private manner. Publicly making sarcastic remarks in a workplace can be seen as unprofessional, regardless of the intent. HR's role is to maintain a respectful workplace, so even if the author's point had merit, the delivery led to harassment charges. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworker's situation is complex. She has a legitimate need for emotional support, but the practicality of caring for a dog isn't working out. The author's concern about the dog's well-being is valid, but their approach was flawed. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a workplace conduct standpoint, using sarcasm and making comments that others perceive as harassment is problematic. Even if the underlying issue is a valid one, the method of communication matters. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility for how they expressed their concerns, even if their intent was to help. However, the coworker also made a poor decision by reporting the author instead of addressing the situation constructively. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions led to a harassment report, which is a serious workplace issue. While their concern about the dog's treatment is valid, the way they expressed it crossed professional boundaries. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong for the manner in which they communicated their concerns, even if their intent was good.\n"
