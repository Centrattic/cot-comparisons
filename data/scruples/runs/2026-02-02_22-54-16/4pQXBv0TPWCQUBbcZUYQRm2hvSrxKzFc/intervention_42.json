She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker getting a dog despite having a long work hours and commute. The author got annoyed and made sarcastic comments, leading to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker has a history of trauma and uses emotional support for anxiety. Her colleagues thought a dog would help. However, the author points out that she's away 14 hours a day, making it hard to care for the dog properly. The dog ends up in a kennel most of the time, leading to odor issues. The author's sarcastic remarks led to conflict.\n\nNow, the author's intention was to express concern about the dog's welfare. But the way they communicated it was through sarcasm, which might have been harsh. Even though the author's concern was valid, using sarcasm in a professional setting can come off as unprofessional or hurtful. The coworker took offense and reported the author, which complicates things.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, if the coworker reported harassment, the company might take it seriously. The author might not have intended to harass, but the comments could be seen as contributing to a hostile work environment. However, the author's underlying concern about the dog's welfare is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker's situation is sensitive. She has valid emotional needs, and the dog was supposed to help. The author's comments might have invalidated her coping mechanism. But the coworker's responsibility to care for the dog properly is also a factor. The author might not have the right to interfere directly, especially without offering solutions.\n\nIn the workplace, even if the author's intent was good, the method of expressing concern was inappropriate. Sarcasm isn't constructive and can escalate conflicts. HR's role is to mediate, and the author might have been within their rights to express concern, but the approach led to being seen as the problem.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might be that the author is not entirely wrong, but their approach was flawed. However, the company's HR would focus on the behavior rather than the intent. Since the author's comments were reported as harassment, even if they were trying to help, the outcome might lean towards the author being in the wrong because of the way they expressed their concerns.\n"
