She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario is about a coworker who got a dog, but the author is upset because the coworker is away so much. The author made sarcastic comments, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which might make getting a therapy dog seem reasonable. However, the author is concerned about the dog's well-being because the coworker is away 14 hours a day. The author's sarcastic remarks led to conflict and HR involvement.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The author's intention was to express concern about the dog's welfare, but they did it in a sarcastic and possibly harsh way. The coworker, on the other hand, might feel that her emotional needs are being dismissed or criticized. Therapy animals can be important for mental health, but overworking the animal or not providing proper care is a problem.\n\nThe author's comments were direct and could be seen as judgmental, even if well-intentioned. However, the coworker taking it to HR might be an overreaction, especially if the author's comments were made in a group where others supported the author. The key is whether the author was wrong in their approach versus the coworker in escalating it to HR.\n\nIn workplace dynamics, even if the author had valid concerns, the way they expressed them could be problematic. Sarcastic remarks can come off as harassment, even if the intent was to help. The author might not be in the wrong for having the concern, but the method of expressing it was inappropriate, which could make them at fault in a professional setting. However, if the coworker is using the dog for emotional support, the author's criticism might be seen as invalidating her needs, even if the situation isn't ideal.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the author's comments were meant to genuinely help but were delivered poorly, they might have a point about the dog's well-being. But the sarcastic comment about Netflix and the dog dying could be seen as cruel or insensitive, leading to the HR issue. The coworker's reaction might be excessive, but the author's approach was not professional. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely wrong for having the concern, but their delivery was inappropriate, making them at least partially responsible. However, depending on company policies, even the mention of harassment could be taken seriously. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but some might argue A because of the delivery. I think the author isn't in the wrong for the concern but the way they expressed it was wrong. But the question is if the author is in the wrong overall. Since the sarcastic remarks led to HR and the author's intent was to help, maybe the answer is B. But it's a tough call."
