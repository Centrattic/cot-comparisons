She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for getting angry at their friend over getting a dog. The situation is that the friend works long hours and has a traumatic past, and the author is upset that the dog is left alone so much. The author made sarcastic comments, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has a valid reason for needing emotional support, which the coworker uses the dog for. However, the author's concern is about the dog's welfare, given the long hours. The sarcastic remark about giving the dog to someone else or suggesting Netflix might come across as dismissive of the friend's emotional needs. But the author's intention was to point out the impracticality of the situation.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author's concern about animal welfare is valid. However, the way they expressed it\u2014sarcastically and in a way that could be seen as mocking the friend's reliance on the dog for emotional support\u2014might be problematic. The friend could feel that the author is undermining her coping mechanism, especially given her trauma history. \n\nHR's role here is to handle workplace conduct. Even if the author's comments were meant to highlight an issue, using sarcasm and making jokes about someone's emotional support animal in the workplace could be seen as unprofessional or even harassing, regardless of intent. The friend might have felt attacked, especially if she's already in a vulnerable state. \n\nThe key points are: the author's concern is valid regarding the dog's care, but the method of expressing that concern was inappropriate. The workplace environment and the potential for the comment to be perceived as harassment, even if unintended, is a factor. \n\nSo, while the author might not be entirely at fault in terms of the dog's welfare, the way they communicated their concerns likely crossed into unprofessional territory, leading to the HR issue. Therefore, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because of how they expressed their opinion, even if their concern was justified.\n"
