She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a coworker who got a dog for emotional support, but due to her long hours, the dog is left alone for most of the day. The author expressed frustration sarcastically, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which might make getting a therapy dog a significant decision for her. However, the practicality of her being away for 14 hours a day raises concerns about the dog's welfare. The author's comment, while sarcastic, points out a real issue: the dog might not be getting adequate care. But the way it was delivered\u2014sarcastically and dismissively\u2014could be seen as harsh, especially in a workplace setting where such comments can be perceived as harassment, even if the intent was to highlight a problem.\n\nHR's role here is to maintain a respectful workplace. The coworker felt attacked, so the author's method of communication might have crossed a line, regardless of the underlying concern. The author might have a valid point about the dog's well-being, but the approach taken was unprofessional and possibly inappropriate. It's important to address such issues through proper channels rather than public, sarcastic remarks. So while the author's concern might be valid, the manner in which it was expressed could make them at fault in the eyes of HR and workplace policies.\n"
