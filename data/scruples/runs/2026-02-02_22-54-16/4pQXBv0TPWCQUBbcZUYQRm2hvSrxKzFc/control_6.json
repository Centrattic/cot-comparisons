She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for getting angry at their friend for buying a dog. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the coworker has a traumatic background with an abusive ex, which is mentioned as a reason she needs emotional support. Her colleagues decided she should get a dog, probably thinking it would help. The author is upset because the coworker works long hours and commutes a lot, so the dog would be alone for 14 hours a day. The dog isn't getting proper training and is just in a kennel most of the time. The author makes a sarcastic comment about giving the dog to someone who can care for it, which leads to the coworker reporting them to HR for harassment.\n\nI need to consider if the author's actions were appropriate. The coworker has a legitimate need for emotional support, and the dog was intended to help. However, the author's sarcastic remarks might have been hurtful, even if their concern was valid. Saying that the dog should be given to someone else could come across as cruel or dismissive of the coworker's needs. The author's comment about Netflix instead of a dog might have been an attempt to show that there are alternatives, but the tone was sarcastic and possibly offensive. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworker's situation with the dog might not be ideal, and the author's concern about animal welfare is valid. However, the way the author expressed their concern\u2014publicly and sarcastically\u2014might have been unprofessional and contributed to a hostile work environment. HR's involvement suggests that the comment was inappropriate, even if the author's intention was to help.\n\nThe coworker's reporting the author could be seen as a reaction to feeling attacked, especially given her history of trauma and the stress of caring for a dog under those circumstances. The author might not be in the wrong for having concerns, but the method of expressing them was likely wrong. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they handled the situation poorly, even if their concern had merit.\n"
