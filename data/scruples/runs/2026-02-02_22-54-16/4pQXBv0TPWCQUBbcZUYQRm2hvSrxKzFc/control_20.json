She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a coworker getting a dog despite having a long work schedule, leading to the dog being left alone most of the time. The author expressed their opinion sarcastically, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the author's actions. They made a sarcastic comment suggesting giving the dog to someone who can care for it. They also compared the dog to Netflix, which is a harsh analogy. The coworker was seeking advice, and the author's response was dismissive and mocking. Using sarcasm in a professional setting can be problematic because it's not constructive. Even if the author had valid concerns about the dog's welfare, the way they expressed it was inappropriate.\n\nNext, the coworker reported the author for harassment. The author's comments, while perhaps well-intentioned in terms of animal welfare, were delivered in a way that could be perceived as hostile. In a workplace, it's important to address issues respectfully. The author didn't approach the coworker privately to discuss their concerns. Instead, they made public, sarcastic remarks which led to conflict and HR involvement.\n\nThe coworker's perspective is that the dog is a therapy animal for her emotional support. The author's response dismissed her emotional needs and invalidated her situation. Even if the author believed the dog was being neglected, attacking the coworker's choice and mocking her therapy dog could be seen as unkind and unprofessional. The author should have considered a more supportive approach, perhaps suggesting solutions like dog walking services or training resources instead of making sarcastic comments.\n\nThe outcome was that the author was made to feel like a villain, but the coworker had HR on her side. The author's method of addressing the issue was not constructive, leading to a negative reaction. While the author might have had valid concerns about animal welfare, the manner in which they expressed it was inappropriate. The correct approach would have been to address the issue privately and respectfully, without sarcasm or public criticism.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's comments were unprofessional and contributed to a hostile work environment. Even if their intentions were to help, the way they communicated their concerns was wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
