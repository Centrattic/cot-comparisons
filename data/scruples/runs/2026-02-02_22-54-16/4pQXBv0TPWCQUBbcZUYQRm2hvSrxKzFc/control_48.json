She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry at their friend who bought a dog under these circumstances.\n\nFirst, the coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which the workplace considered by suggesting a therapy dog. The author is upset because the coworker works 11-hour days with a long commute, making it impossible to care for the dog properly. The author's sarcastic comments led to a HR report.\n\nThe key points here are the coworker's mental health needs and the practicality of pet ownership. Therapy animals can be beneficial for people with anxiety, so the coworker's request might be legitimate. However, the author's concerns about the dog's welfare are valid because leaving it alone for 14 hours a day is neglectful. But the author's response was sarcastic and dismissive, which came across as harsh. \n\nThe coworker might not have considered the dog's needs, focusing only on her own emotional support. The author's comment about Netflix was a backhanded way of criticizing the decision, which could be seen as insensitive, even if they had a point. The coworker felt attacked, leading to HR involvement. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author might not be entirely at fault for pointing out the problem, but their approach was inappropriate. However, the coworker's actions also have issues. The question is whether the author's method of expressing their concern was wrong. Since the author's response was sarcastic and led to being reported, they likely handled it poorly. But the core issue is that the coworker's situation isn't sustainable for a pet. \n\nSo, the author's intent might have been to highlight a problem, but the delivery was wrong. Therefore, they share some responsibility. But the coworker's actions (getting a dog she can't care for) are also problematic. The answer is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they made a sarcastic comment that was reported, they might be partially at fault. But it's a bit nuanced. The coworker's report might be overreacting, but the author's approach was offensive. So maybe the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because their response was inappropriate, even if their concern was valid.\n"
