She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry with a friend who bought a dog despite having a long work schedule. The friend has a history of trauma and uses the dog as emotional support. The author expressed their concerns sarcastically, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend works 11-hour days with a 90-minute commute, so the dog is alone 14 hours a day. The author is worried about the dog's well-being and the friend's ability to care for it. But the way the author communicated that concern was sarcastic and harsh. Saying \"Give the dog to an owner who can care for it\" and comparing the dog to Netflix is clearly meant to be cutting. \n\nWhile the author's concern might be valid, the method of expressing it is problematic. Sarcasm and mockery, even if well-intentioned, can come off as cruel and dismissive. The friend was already vulnerable and using the dog for emotional support. The author's comments could be seen as attacking the friend's choices and the dog's purpose, which is not a constructive way to address the issue. \n\nIn a workplace setting, even if the friend is a coworker, personal relationships can sometimes lead to conflicts. However, the friend reported the author for harassment, which is serious. The author's sarcastic remarks might have made the friend feel belittled and unsupported, especially since others didn't voice similar concerns. The author's failure to approach the situation with empathy and a more supportive tone could have exacerbated the problem. \n\nSo, even though the author had a valid concern about the dog's welfare, the way it was communicated was inappropriate. The correct answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because the method of expressing concern was harsh and led to harassment accusations, which is unprofessional and hurtful.\n"
