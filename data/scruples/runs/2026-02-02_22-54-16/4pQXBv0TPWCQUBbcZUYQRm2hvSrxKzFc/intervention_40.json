She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that a coworker gets a dog, which the author thinks is a bad idea because the coworker works long hours and the dog would be alone too much. The author makes a sarcastic comment suggesting giving the dog to someone else, which leads to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social dynamics here. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which is a sensitive issue. The author's comment, while perhaps based on concern, came off as sarcastic and dismissive. Sarcasm can be perceived as harsh, especially in a workplace setting. Even if the author's intention was to point out the problem, the delivery might have been inappropriate.\n\nNext, the response from the coworker involved reporting to HR. That's a significant step. The author's remark was not just a private opinion but shared in a way that was overheard or reported. The use of \"harassment\" is a strong accusation, but in HR terms, even if the author didn't mean to harass, the comment might be seen as contributing to a hostile work environment if it targeted someone's personal choices in a mocking way.\n\nThen, the author mentions that others support them, but the coworker has them against them. The question is whether the author crossed a line. Even if the author believes they were right in pointing out the dog's welfare issue, the workplace isn't the best place to debate such personal decisions, especially with sarcasm. The comment about Netflix is dismissive of the coworker's emotional needs, which could come across as insensitive.\n\nLegally, unless the comment was discriminatory or part of a pattern of harassment, it might not hold up. However, HR often looks at the perception and impact, not just intent. The coworker felt attacked, and the author's comment might be seen as unprofessional.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker getting a dog that can't be properly cared for is a valid concern. The author's intention was to help, but the method was flawed. The right approach might have been to suggest alternatives privately or through proper channels, not public sarcastic remarks.\n\nSo, balancing intent and impact, the author's actions, while well-meaning, were unprofessional and contributed to conflict. Therefore, the answer is A (in the wrong) but with nuance that the coworker's actions also had issues.\n"
