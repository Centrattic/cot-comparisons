She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a coworker who got a dog despite having a busy schedule, leading to the dog being alone for long hours. The author expressed their concerns sarcastically, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The coworker has a history of trauma and uses emotional support, which might be a protected status under some laws. The author is concerned about the dog's welfare because the coworker isn't home enough to train or care for it properly. The author's sarcastic comments, while possibly well-intentioned, were taken as harassment.\n\nLegally, if the coworker has an emotional support animal, there might be protections. But the author's comments being reported to HR suggests that even if the concern is valid, the way it was expressed was inappropriate. The author's frustration is understandable, but using sarcasm and making jokes about the dog's treatment could be seen as unprofessional or hurtful, especially in a workplace setting. The coworker might have felt targeted or that her emotional support needs were being dismissed.\n\nHowever, the author's main point about the dog's welfare being compromised by the coworker's schedule is valid. But in a professional environment, how you communicate your concerns matters. The author might have been right about the situation but wrong in the delivery. They should have addressed it more constructively, perhaps suggesting alternatives like professional dog care or training services instead of making sarcastic remarks.\n\nThe coworker's reaction and the HR involvement indicate that the author's comments crossed a line, even if their intentions were to highlight a problem. The company might prioritize maintaining a respectful workplace over the validity of the concern. So, while the author's concern is valid, the method of expressing it was unprofessional, leading to them being in the wrong in the workplace context.\n"
