She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a coworker got a dog, but the author is upset because the coworker works long hours and the dog is left alone a lot. The coworker can't properly train the dog, and the author makes a sarcastic comment about giving the dog to someone else. The coworker then reports the author to HR for harassment. The author is now being criticized by others but feels they're in the right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which might make getting a therapy dog a meaningful decision for her. The author is concerned about the dog's welfare, seeing the dog left alone most of the time and not properly trained. However, the author's response was sarcastic and dismissive, which could come off as harsh. \n\nEven if the author's intentions were to address the dog's welfare, the way they expressed it was probably not appropriate. Making a sarcastic comment in the workplace can be seen as unprofessional, especially if it's about a colleague's personal choice. The coworker might feel that the comment was attacking her decision and her ability to care for the dog, which could trigger her trauma or make her feel judged. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is pointing out a potential problem that others might be ignoring. The coworker's choice might not be in the dog's best interest, but the author's approach led to a conflict. The key issue is whether the author's method of expressing concern was appropriate. \n\nWorkplace harassment policies usually cover behavior that creates a hostile environment. If the comment was a one-time sarcastic remark without any malicious intent, it might not be harassment. However, the coworker perceived it as such, and the author's words could be seen as undermining her mental health support. The author might not be in the wrong if their intent was to help, but the delivery was poor. Alternatively, if the comment was seen as targeting the coworker's personal situation, it could be considered inconsiderate or even discriminatory, depending on the company's policies.\n\nAnother angle is that the author's concern is valid regarding the dog's welfare, but they didn't address it through the right channels. They should have perhaps addressed the coworker privately or brought up the issue in a respectful manner rather than making a snide remark. By doing so, they could avoid the perception of harassment.\n\nIn summary, while the author might have had a legitimate concern about the dog's care, their sarcastic comment was unprofessional and likely contributed to the coworker's feeling of being attacked. The author's approach was inappropriate, so they might be in the wrong for not handling the situation more sensitively. However, if the comment was a genuine concern expressed in a poor way, there could be shared responsibility. But HR's role here is to mediate, and the coworker's report led to the author being seen as the villain. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong for their choice of words.\n"
