She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for getting angry at their friend for buying a dog. The friend has a history of trauma and anxiety, and the coworkers suggested getting a dog. The coworker works long hours and commutes a lot, leading to the dog being left alone for 14 hours a day. The author is annoyed because the dog isn't getting proper care and training, and when the kennel smells, the author makes a sarcastic comment. The friend then reports them to HR, making the author feel like the villain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author's concern is valid because dogs need attention and proper care. Leaving a dog alone for 14 hours is generally not recommended and can be considered neglect. The author's comment was sarcastic but was pointing out a real issue. However, the way they expressed their concern might have been harsh and not constructive. The coworker, who has a history of trauma and anxiety, might rely on the dog for emotional support, which is a legitimate need. The author's comment about giving the dog away could be seen as dismissive of the coworker's emotional needs and the dog's purpose as a therapy animal. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's method of expressing their concern was appropriate. While the author had valid points about the dog's welfare, approaching it with sarcasm and a comment about Netflix could come off as insensitive and unhelpful. The coworker might feel that her emotional support needs are being undermined, especially since she's already vulnerable. The author's comment could be perceived as mocking her reliance on the dog for support, which is why the coworker took offense and reported them. \n\nHR's perspective would likely look at the intent behind the comment and the impact it had. Even if the intent was to highlight a problem, the impact was negative, leading to a hostile work environment. The author didn't address the issue constructively; instead, they made a sarcastic remark. The coworker, feeling attacked, used HR as a way to protect her emotional support animal. \n\nHowever, the coworker's actions might also be questionable if she's not providing adequate care for the dog. But from HR's standpoint, they might prioritize maintaining workplace harmony and ensuring that employees don't make derogatory comments, even if the underlying issue is valid. The author's approach could be seen as harassment because it targeted the coworker's personal decisions in a public or work-related context. \n\nIn summary, the author's concern is valid, but their method of expressing it was inappropriate. The sarcastic comment and the suggestion to give the dog away could be seen as contributing to a hostile work environment. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation more sensitively and constructively.\n"
