She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry at their coworker's decision to get a dog despite her long work hours.\n\nFirst, the coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, and others thought a dog would help. But the author is concerned about the dog's well-being because the coworker is away so much. The author made sarcastic comments, which led to being reported to HR. The coworker labeled it as harassment, but HR eventually saw the author's side.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intention versus the method. The author was trying to point out a potential problem with the dog's care, but used sarcasm and a harsh remark. While the concern might be valid, the way it was expressed was unprofessional and could be seen as contributing to a hostile work environment. \n\nHowever, the coworker reported the author for harassment, which seems a bit disproportionate if the comments were just sarcastic. The author's comments were based on a genuine concern, but the delivery was poor. The fact that HR acknowledged the author's side suggests that the coworker might have overreacted. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intentions were to highlight a problem, but the method was inappropriate. So, while the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they had a valid point, their approach was flawed. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Sarcasm and dismissive comments in a professional setting can be seen as unprofessional. The coworker's decision to report HR might have been an overreaction, but the author's comments crossed a line, even if they had good intentions. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the answer might lean towards the author being partially at fault for the tone, but not entirely wrong for raising a concern. However, the options are A (yes) or B (no). Since the author's intent was to help but the method was unprofessional, it's a bit of a gray area. But since HR found the author not entirely wrong, maybe the answer is B. But the sarcastic remarks could still be considered unprofessional, so maybe A. Hmm.\n"
