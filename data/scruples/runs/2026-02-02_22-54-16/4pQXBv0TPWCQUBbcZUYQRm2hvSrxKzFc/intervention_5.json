She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry at their friend for buying a dog. The situation is that the coworker has a lot of emotional issues, including trauma from an abusive ex. The author is annoyed because the coworker works long hours and commutes a lot, so the dog will be alone most of the time. The author made sarcastic comments about the dog's treatment and got reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The coworker's mental health is a factor. She might genuinely need emotional support, which the dog is supposed to provide. But the author is concerned about the dog's welfare, as it's being left alone for long hours and not properly trained. The author's sarcastic remarks led to being reported, which complicates things.\n\nIs the author being inconsiderate by criticizing the coworker's decision? Or is the author right to point out the potential harm to the dog? On one hand, the coworker might not be aware of the dog's needs. On the other, the author's comments were harsh and sarcastic, which could be seen as unprofessional, especially leading to HR involvement.\n\nThe author's intention was to voice concerns, but the way they did it was confrontational. The coworker felt attacked, and the author's comments could be seen as undermining her emotional support needs. However, the coworker's actions might not be in the dog's best interest, so the author has a valid point about the dog's welfare.\n\nI need to balance these two perspectives. The author's criticism might be justified, but the method of expressing it was inappropriate. Sarcastic remarks can be hurtful and unproductive, especially in a workplace setting. The coworker might have felt targeted, leading to the HR report. So, while the author's concern is valid, their approach was flawed, which could make them at fault for the way they expressed their disagreement.\n"
