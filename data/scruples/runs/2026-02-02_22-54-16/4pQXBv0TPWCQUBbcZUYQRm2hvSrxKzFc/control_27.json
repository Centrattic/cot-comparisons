She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a coworker who got a dog for emotional support but ends up not being able to spend enough time with it because of her long work hours and commute. The author gets annoyed and makes sarcastic comments about giving the dog to someone else, which leads to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The coworker has trauma and anxiety, and the dog was meant to help her. But the author is concerned about the dog's welfare because it's left alone for so long. The author's comment was sarcastic and maybe a bit harsh, but was it harassment?\n\nThe coworker reported the author, but HR might have considered the context. The author's intention was to point out the problem with the dog's care, but the method was inappropriate. Sarcastic remarks can come off as cruel, even if the underlying concern is valid. However, the coworker is the one who brought the dog into the situation, so maybe she's at fault for not considering the dog's needs.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, if the comment was reported as harassment, HR would look at if it was a valid concern expressed appropriately. The author did voice their opinion in a sarcastic way, which isn't the best approach. However, the coworker's actions (reporting the comment) might be more about deflection from her own poor decision. \n\nSo, the author's concern was valid regarding the dog's welfare, but the delivery was unprofessional and sarcastic, which could be seen as harassment. Alternatively, if the author's intent was to help by suggesting the dog be rehomed, maybe the method was wrong but the intent was good. \n\nIn many workplaces, even if a concern is valid, the way it's communicated matters. Sarcastic remarks can be perceived as bullying or harassment regardless of intent. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how they expressed their concern instead of addressing it constructively. But the coworker also should have considered the dog's needs before getting it. \n\nI think the key here is the method of communication. The author's sarcastic comment could be seen as unprofessional and contributing to a hostile work environment, even if they were trying to help. So the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong). But maybe the coworker's actions also have merit in seeking support. Hmm, maybe the answer is A because the author's approach was inappropriate, even if their concern was valid.\n"
