She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author got angry with a coworker for getting a dog, given the coworker's long hours and the dog's living conditions. The author made sarcastic comments, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which makes getting a therapy dog a valid need. The author is concerned about the dog's welfare, especially since it's left alone for 14 hours a day. The author's comments were sarcastic, suggesting giving the dog to someone else or suggesting alternatives like Netflix. But the coworker took offense and reported the author.\n\nOn one hand, the author had a valid concern about the dog's well-being. Leaving a dog alone for such long hours isn't ideal, and the author was pointing out a potential problem. However, the way the author expressed that concern was sarcastic and dismissive, which might have come across as harsh. The coworker might have felt attacked, especially given her own sensitive history. The comments about Netflix could be seen as minimizing her emotional needs.\n\nHR's role is to handle workplace harassment and ensure a respectful environment. Even if the author's intention was to help, the sarcastic tone could be perceived as harassment. The author's comments were public, leading to the coworker feeling targeted. In a workplace, it's important to address concerns constructively rather than with sarcasm, especially when it comes to personal choices.\n\nThe author's position is that they were just speaking the truth, but in a workplace setting, the method of communication matters. The coworker might not have appreciated the public criticism, especially given her vulnerabilities. The author might have thought they were helping, but the delivery was inappropriate. So, even if the concern was valid, the way it was expressed could be seen as unprofessional.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's concern for the dog's welfare is understandable, the sarcastic and public manner in which they expressed it likely crossed the line into harassment. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong from an HR perspective, even if their intentions were good.\n"
