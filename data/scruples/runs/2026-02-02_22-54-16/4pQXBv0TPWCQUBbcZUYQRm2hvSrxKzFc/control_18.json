She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the coworker got a dog for emotional support, but the author is upset because the coworker can't spend enough time with the dog due to her long work hours. The author made sarcastic comments about giving the dog to someone else and compared it to Netflix, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker has a traumatic past and gets emotional support from the dog. The author's comments, while maybe coming from a place of concern, were sarcastic and dismissive. Sarcastic remarks can be hurtful, even if the intention is to point out a problem. The coworker might have felt attacked, especially if she's already dealing with anxiety and trauma. \n\nThe author's main issue is valid\u2014keeping a dog in a kennel for most of the day isn't ideal. But instead of addressing it constructively, the author used sarcasm. That could be seen as unprofessional and insensitive, especially in a workplace setting. \n\nHR was involved because the coworker reported it as harassment. Even if the author didn't mean to harass, the comments were taken that way. The key here is how the message was delivered. The author might have had a legitimate concern, but the way they expressed it was inappropriate. \n\nAlso, the coworker might feel that her emotional support needs are being undermined. The author's suggestion to use Netflix instead of a dog could dismiss her legitimate need for emotional support. So even if the author's intent was to help, the method was flawed. \n\nIn terms of workplace dynamics, it's important to communicate concerns respectfully. The author could have approached the coworker privately to express their worries or maybe suggested other options for the dog's care. Instead, making sarcastic remarks in a public or semi-public setting would likely cause more harm.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the author might have a valid concern about the dog's welfare, the way they handled it was inappropriate. The sarcastic tone and dismissive comments contributed to a hostile work environment, which is why HR got involved. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
