She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves their coworker getting a dog despite having a busy schedule, leading to the dog being left alone for long hours. The author expresses frustration and makes a sarcastic comment, which gets them reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's intent. They were concerned about the dog's welfare, given the coworker's work hours. The comment about giving the dog to someone else was meant to highlight the problem, but the tone was sarcastic. Sarcasm can come off as harsh, even if the intention is to help. \n\nNext, the coworker's perspective: she has a history of trauma and uses the dog for emotional support. The author's comment might be seen as dismissive of her emotional needs. Even if the author's concern is valid, the way they expressed it led to conflict. \n\nHR involvement is a key point. The author's sarcastic remark was taken as harassment, which is serious. While the coworker might be defensive, the author's approach could have been more constructive. Instead of making a snide comment, they could have raised the issue in a more supportive manner or discussed it privately. \n\nWorkplace dynamics matter. The author's comment, even if well-intentioned, disrupted the work environment and led to a report. The coworker likely felt attacked, especially given her history of trauma. The author's public sarcasm might not have considered her sensitivities. \n\nHowever, the author's concern about the dog's welfare is valid. The situation raises ethical questions about animal care. But expressing that concern in a disrespectful way can backfire, as seen here. \n\nIn summary, the author's intention was to highlight a real issue, but the method used was inappropriate. The sarcastic comment could be seen as contributing to a hostile work environment, which HR would take seriously. So, while the concern is legitimate, the approach was wrong. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
