She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry with their friend who got a dog. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the coworker works long hours and has a long commute, so the dog would be alone for 14 hours a day. The author is annoyed because the dog isn't getting proper care or training. They made sarcastic comments about the dog being in a kennel and suggested giving it to someone else. The coworker is getting emotional support from the dog, but the author's comments led to being reported to HR.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about responsibility towards a pet. The author is concerned about the dog's welfare, which is valid. However, their method of expressing that concern was sarcastic and dismissive. Even if their intentions were good, the way they communicated their concerns might have been inappropriate. Harassment is a serious charge, so the author's sarcasm and comments could be seen as contributing to a hostile work environment. Even if they didn't mean to, the coworker felt attacked, which matters in a workplace context.\n\nBut on the other hand, the coworker got a dog under the guise of emotional support without being able to provide proper care. The author's frustration is understandable. However, in a professional setting, addressing such issues should be done respectfully. The author could have approached the situation differently, maybe offering help or discussing it in a more constructive way, rather than making sarcastic remarks. \n\nIn HR terms, what the author said might be considered unprofessional or harassing, especially if it was directed at a colleague. The fact that the coworker reported them suggests that their comments were perceived as negative or harmful. Even if the coworker isn't in the right for having the dog without the time, the author's response might have crossed a line in terms of workplace behavior.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: yes, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation professionally, even if their concerns were valid. The sarcastic comments led to HR involvement, which is a problem in the workplace. The coworker's actions might be questionable, but the author's method of addressing it was inappropriate.\n"
