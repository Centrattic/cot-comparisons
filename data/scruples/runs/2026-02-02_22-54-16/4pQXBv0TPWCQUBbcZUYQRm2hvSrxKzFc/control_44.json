She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original story is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker getting a dog despite having a busy schedule, and the author getting into a conflict after making sarcastic comments. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which her colleagues might be trying to support with a therapy dog. The author is concerned because the coworker works long hours and commutes a lot, leading to the dog being alone for extended periods. The author expresses their concern sarcastically, which leads to being reported to HR.\n\nNow, considering the possible angles. The coworker's well-being and her dog's welfare are both at play here. The author's main issue is the dog's living conditions, but their approach was to make sarcastic remarks. While the author might have valid concerns about animal welfare, the way they communicated it was dismissive and sarcastic. That could come off as unprofessional and hurtful, especially if the coworker is already vulnerable.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker might not have fully considered the responsibility of owning a dog with her schedule, but that doesn't justify the author's sarcastic comments. However, the author's intention was to point out a problem. But using humor or sarcasm in a professional setting can be problematic. Also, the fact that the coworker reported the author for harassment suggests that the comments crossed a line, even if the underlying concern was valid.\n\nBut wait, the author is being painted as the villain, but maybe they had legitimate concerns. The coworkers decided to get a dog for the coworker, which could have been a group decision without considering the practical aspects. The author's sarcastic comment was a reaction to the situation, but instead of addressing it constructively, they used sarcasm, which led to conflict.\n\nIn terms of the actual wrongdoings: the author's comment, while harsh, was a response to a situation they observed. However, in a workplace, it's important to address issues professionally. Sarcastic remarks can be seen as bullying or harassment, especially if the target is already in a sensitive position. The author might not be in the wrong for having the concern, but definitely in the wrong for how they expressed it. However, the coworker's action of reporting to HR might be an overreaction if the comment was made in a group or among colleagues.\n\nBut the coworker's side is that the dog is a therapy animal, which is supposed to help her through tough times. The author's comment about Netflix is dismissive of her needs. The author's valid concern about the dog's welfare is overshadowed by the tone of the message. So, while the author has a point about the dog's living conditions, the method of communication was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is at least partially at fault for the way they expressed their concerns, leading to the conflict.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. In terms of HR and professional conduct, making sarcastic remarks in the workplace can be problematic. Even if they had good intentions, the approach was unprofessional. So the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A), because their method of communication was inappropriate despite the underlying concern.\n"
