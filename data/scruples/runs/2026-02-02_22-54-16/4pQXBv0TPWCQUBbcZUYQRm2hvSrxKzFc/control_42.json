She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about a coworker who got a dog, but the author is upset because the coworker works long hours and the dog is left alone a lot. The author made sarcastic comments about the dog and got reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, and the dog is supposed to be a therapy animal. Getting a therapy dog is often a way to cope with such issues, so there's a valid reason for her to have one. However, the author is concerned about the dog's welfare because the coworker can't be home much to care for it. The author's sarcastic remarks about giving the dog away or suggesting alternatives like Netflix led to a report.\n\nNow, considering the author's actions: while their concern for the dog is understandable, approaching the issue with sarcasm and making comments that come off as dismissive of the coworker's needs isn't the best way to handle it. The coworker might feel attacked, especially since the dog is part of her emotional support. The author could have brought up the concern in a more supportive and constructive manner, perhaps discussing the challenges of caring for a pet with long work hours.\n\nBut then, the coworker got reported to HR, which is a serious consequence. The author's comments, even if well-intentioned, were harsh and public. Even if the coworker is not handling the dog well, the way the author addressed it was inappropriate. The author should have considered the coworker's emotional state and the therapeutic purpose of the dog. Publicly mocking the situation could be seen as harassment, especially if it's done in a way that undermines someone's mental health support.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker's decision to report the author might also be questionable if the author's intent was to genuinely help. However, HR's role is to handle such complaints, and the author's method of communication was not professional. The key here is whether the author's actions were justified. While the concern is valid, the approach taken was not. The author should have found a more appropriate way to express their worries, perhaps through a private, supportive conversation rather than sarcastic public remarks.\n\nSo, the author's intentions might be good, but the method of communication was flawed. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because their approach was unprofessional and contributed to harassment claims, even if the underlying concern was valid.\n"
