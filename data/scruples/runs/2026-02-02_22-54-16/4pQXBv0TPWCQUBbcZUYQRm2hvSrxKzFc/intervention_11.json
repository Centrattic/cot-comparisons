She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry at their coworker for getting a dog, given the situation.\n\nFirst, the coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, and the dog was meant as emotional support. The author is concerned because the coworker works long hours, so the dog ends up being alone most of the time. The author expresses their concern sarcastically, which leads to being reported to HR.\n\nNow, the key points here are the intent and the context. The author's main issue is the dog's well-being, not the coworker's mental health. However, the way they expressed their concern was through sarcasm and a harsh comment about giving the dog away. That's where the problem arises. Even if the author's intention was to highlight the dog's neglect, using sarcasm and making a cutting remark in a public or professional setting can be seen as unprofessional or hurtful.\n\nThe coworker, who has a history of being mistreated, might be more sensitive to criticism, especially about something she sees as helping her cope. The author's comment about Netflix instead of a therapy dog could come off as dismissive of her legitimate emotional needs. While the author might believe they're acting in the dog's best interest, the method of communication was inappropriate. \n\nHR's involvement suggests that the workplace has policies against harassment or unprofessional behavior, even if the comment was meant to be a joke. The author's sarcastic remark, regardless of intent, contributed to a hostile work environment. The coworker felt attacked, which is why she reported it. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily malicious but failed to communicate their concerns constructively. The coworker's side has more support because the author's response was harsh and public. So while the author's concern for the dog is valid, their approach was flawed, making them at least partially at fault. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because their method of expressing concern was inappropriate and unprofessional, even if their underlying concern was valid.\n"
