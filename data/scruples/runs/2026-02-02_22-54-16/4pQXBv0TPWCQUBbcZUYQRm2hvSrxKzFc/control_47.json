She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker getting a dog for emotional support, but the author is upset because the coworker can't properly care for it due to her long hours. The author made sarcastic comments about the dog being left alone and the kennel smell, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, and getting a dog was a group decision. The author feels the dog isn't being properly trained because the coworker is away so much. The author's sarcastic remarks, like suggesting giving the dog away or suggesting Netflix instead, were taken as harassment. The coworker reported the author, and now the author feels isolated.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: Is the author's criticism justified? The author is concerned about the dog's welfare, which is valid. However, the way the author expressed those concerns\u2014sarcastically and publicly\u2014might have been inappropriate. Sarcastic or harsh comments, even if there's truth in them, can be seen as unkind or harassing, especially in a workplace setting.\n\nThe coworker's perspective is important too. She has emotional support needs, and the dog was recommended for her well-being. The author's comments might have undermined her support system, even if the dog's care is lacking. The coworker might feel that the author is dismissing her needs, which could be hurtful.\n\nWorkplace dynamics matter here. Even if the author's intentions were to point out a problem, using sarcasm and making public remarks could be considered unprofessional. The company might prioritize maintaining a respectful environment over the validity of the criticism. The fact that the author was reported by the coworker and others took her side suggests that the tone and delivery were problematic.\n\nHowever, the author's concern about the dog's welfare isn't baseless. If the dog is left alone for long hours and not properly trained, that's a real issue. The question is whether the author handled it appropriately. Instead of making sarcastic remarks, perhaps addressing it more discreetly or offering alternative solutions could have been better.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author might not be entirely wrong in raising the concern, but the method of doing so was inappropriate. The coworker's emotional needs and the author's approach are both factors. The author's comments led to harassment charges, which indicates that the workplace saw the behavior as unacceptable, regardless of intent.\n\nSo, balancing the valid concern with the delivery, the author's main error was the way they expressed their criticism, not the content itself. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the manner in which they communicated their concerns, leading to the harassment claim, even if the underlying issue has merit.\n"
