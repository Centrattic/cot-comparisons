She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who told their friend off about getting a dog is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker with anxiety and a traumatic past who got a dog, but due to her long work hours, the dog is left alone most of the time. The author expressed their concern sarcastically, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The coworker has a history of trauma and uses a dog for emotional support. The author's main issue is the dog's welfare because it's left alone so much. The author's sarcastic comments, while perhaps well-intentioned, came off as harsh and dismissive of the coworker's emotional needs. \n\nExpressing concerns in a sarcastic or dismissive manner can be seen as unprofessional, even if the underlying concern is valid. The author might have thought they were being honest, but using sarcasm and making jokes about the dog's situation could be perceived as harassment, especially if it's done in a public or work setting. \n\nHowever, the coworker's actions might also be questionable. Getting a dog requires responsibility, and if she can't provide proper care due to her work schedule, maybe she wasn't in the right situation to take on a pet. But the author's approach in addressing this was problematic. \n\nThe key here is the method of communication. The author's sarcastic remarks, even if they were trying to highlight a valid concern, were inappropriate and could contribute to a hostile work environment. The coworker feeling attacked and reporting the author might be justified if the comments were indeed harassing. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworker should have considered the dog's well-being before getting one. But the author's responsibility is not to make sarcastic comments but to perhaps approach the situation with more empathy and offer help or advice in a constructive way.\n\nSo, while the author had a valid concern, the way they communicated it was unprofessional and inconsiderate, leading to the HR issue. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how they expressed their concern, even if their intention was to help.\n"
