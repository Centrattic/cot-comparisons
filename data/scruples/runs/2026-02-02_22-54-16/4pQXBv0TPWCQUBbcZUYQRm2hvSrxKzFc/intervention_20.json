She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker getting a dog despite having a long workday and commute, leading to the dog being alone most of the time. The author expressed sarcastic comments about the dog's care, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which might make a therapy dog beneficial for her mental health. However, the practicality of caring for a dog with such a schedule is questionable. The author's concern about the dog's well-being is valid, but the way they expressed it was sarcastic and potentially harsh.\n\nExpressing opinions in the workplace requires tact. Even if the author's intentions were to highlight a problem, using sarcasm and making negative remarks, especially in a public or professional setting, can be seen as unprofessional. The coworker felt attacked, leading to the HR report. The author's comments, while possibly well-meaning, were delivered in a way that could be perceived as mocking or dismissive of the coworker's emotional needs.\n\nWorkplace dynamics are crucial here. The author's direct approach without offering support or alternative solutions might have exacerbated the situation. It's important to address issues constructively. Instead of making sarcastic remarks, the author could have discussed concerns privately, suggested alternatives for dog care, or expressed support while voicing practical concerns.\n\nThe coworker's right to seek emotional support is important, but so is the responsibility of pet ownership. The author's frustration is understandable, but the method of communication was inappropriate. The workplace environment should encourage open dialogue but without public shaming or sarcasm.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author had valid concerns about the dog's welfare, the manner in which they expressed these concerns was unprofessional and contributed to the conflict. Therefore, the author is at least partially at fault for their approach, even if their intentions were to highlight a real issue.\n"
