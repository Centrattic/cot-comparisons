She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the scenario.\n\nThe author is a coworker who's upset because their friend got a dog despite working long hours and having a long commute. The friend has a history of trauma and anxiety, and the coworkers thought a therapy dog would help. The author is annoyed because the dog will be alone most of the time, and when they made a sarcastic comment about giving the dog to someone else, the friend reported them to HR, leading the author to be seen as the villain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social aspects here. The author's concern is about animal welfare. They're pointing out that the dog isn't getting proper care, which is a valid point. However, the way they expressed their concern was sarcastic and dismissive, which could be seen as harsh or unkind. The friend, on the other hand, has her own valid reasons for needing emotional support, and the author's comment might have come off as insensitive, even if the underlying concern was genuine.\n\nLegally, HR might look at the author's comment as harassment if it was part of a pattern of behavior or targeted the individual. But the author's intent was to highlight a problem. However, the method of expression (sarcasm) and the context (reported to HR) complicates things. The friend's decision to report the comment suggests that the tone and content were offensive, even if the concern was valid.\n\nSocially, the author might be seen as the one at fault because they didn't approach the situation with empathy. The friend is in a vulnerable position due to her trauma and anxiety, and the author's sarcastic remark could be perceived as attacking her emotional needs. The coworkers might have supported the idea of getting a therapy dog for her well-being, so the author's criticism might have been seen as undermining that support.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern about the dog's welfare is legitimate. The dog being left alone for 14 hours a day and spending most time in a kennel could be neglectful. However, the author didn't address it in a constructive way. Instead of making a sarcastic comment, they could have approached the friend privately to express their concerns or suggested alternatives for pet ownership that fit her schedule.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the friend might not be in the right place to care for a pet given her work hours. The coworkers might have good intentions but overlooked the practical aspects. The author's criticism, while delivered poorly, might not be entirely wrong in terms of the situation's validity. However, the way they handled it led to conflict and HR involvement, which is a problem.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the method of expressing concern justifies the outcome. While the concern is valid, the author's approach was inappropriate, leading to the friend feeling attacked. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how they communicated their concern, even if the concern itself is valid. But there's a nuance here between the validity of the concern and the manner in which it was expressed.\n"
