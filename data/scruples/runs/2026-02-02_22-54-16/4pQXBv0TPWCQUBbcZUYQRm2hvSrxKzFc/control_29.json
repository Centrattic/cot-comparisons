She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker getting a dog, and the author expressing their frustration about the dog's treatment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The coworker has anxiety and trauma, and others thought a dog would help. The author is upset because the coworker works long hours, so the dog is left alone most of the time. The author made sarcastic comments about the situation, leading to HR involvement.\n\nHmm, the author's main issue is the dog's welfare. They think the dog isn't being properly trained or cared for because the coworker isn't home enough. The sarcastic remarks might be seen as unprofessional, even if the concern is valid. But the coworker reported the author, making them look like the villain.\n\nI should consider both sides. The author might have a valid concern about animal welfare, but the way they expressed it was sarcastic and possibly inappropriate in a workplace setting. The coworker, on the other hand, might feel that her emotional support needs are being dismissed, and the author's comments were hurtful and judgmental.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, even if they had good intentions, using sarcasm and making jokes about a sensitive topic like a therapy dog could be seen as harassment. The author didn't address the issue constructively, leading to HR involvement. So, maybe the author is at fault for the method of communication rather than the concern itself.\n\nBut wait, the coworker might have overreacted. However, in a professional setting, expressing concerns through HR is a possible response. The author's comments, while perhaps coming from a place of concern, could be considered unkind and not the right approach. So the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong for the way they expressed their concerns.\n"
