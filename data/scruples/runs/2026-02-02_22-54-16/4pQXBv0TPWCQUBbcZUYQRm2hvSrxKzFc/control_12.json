She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a coworker who works long hours and commutes a lot, yet got a dog for emotional support. The poster got annoyed and made sarcastic comments, which led to being reported to HR. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The coworker has anxiety and trauma from an abusive relationship, which are valid reasons for seeking emotional support. The poster is concerned about the dog's well-being since it would be alone 14 hours a day. They expressed their frustration sarcastically, suggesting giving the dog away or using Netflix as an alternative. This led to the coworker reporting them for harassment.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The coworker's right to an emotional support animal is protected, as per laws in many places. However, the poster's sarcastic remarks, while possibly well-intentioned, come across as dismissive and offensive. The issue is not just about the dog's care but how the poster communicated their concerns. \n\nSarcasm can be harmful even if the intent is to help. The poster didn't approach the situation with empathy, which is crucial when dealing with someone's mental health. They made a comment that the coworker took as harassment, and that's a problem. The fact that others agree with the poster doesn't negate the harm caused by the sarcastic remark. \n\nAlso, the poster's statement about the dog dying while away is a bit extreme and might not be constructive. Instead of addressing the issue through a supportive conversation, they chose a mocking tone, which is unprofessional and could be seen as a personal attack. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworker's choice to get a dog despite a busy schedule might be questionable, but it's her decision. The poster's responsibility was to handle their frustration appropriately. \n\nSo, even though the poster's concern about the dog's welfare is valid, the way they expressed it was inappropriate. The answer likely leans towards the author being in the wrong for their sarcastic and unkind comments, despite their intentions.\n"
