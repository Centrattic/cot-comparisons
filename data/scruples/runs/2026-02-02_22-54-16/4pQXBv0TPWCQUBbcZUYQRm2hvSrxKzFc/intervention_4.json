She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a coworker who got a dog for emotional support. The author is upset because the coworker works long hours and commutes a lot, so the dog is left alone most of the time. The author made sarcastic comments about giving the dog to someone else because the current situation isn't good for the dog. Then the coworker reported the author to HR for harassment, and now the author feels like they're the bad guy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The coworker has a valid reason for needing a therapy dog, given her history of trauma and anxiety. Emotional support animals can be prescribed for such conditions. However, the author's concern about the dog's welfare is also valid. Leaving a dog alone for 14 hours a day is not ideal, and the dog being in a kennel all the time might lead to behavioral issues or health problems. \n\nThe author's response was sarcastic and maybe a bit harsh, but they were pointing out a real problem. However, the way they communicated their concern was through sarcasm and a comment about Netflix instead of the dog. That could come off as dismissive or mocking, which is why the coworker took offense and reported it. \n\nIn a workplace setting, even if you're trying to be honest, the method of communication matters. Sarcasm and backhanded comments can be seen as harassment or bullying, even if the underlying concern is valid. HR might side with the coworker because the author's comments were unprofessional and potentially hurtful. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the coworker's responsibility as a pet owner. If she knew the dog would be alone so much, getting a dog might not have been the best decision. However, she might have believed the dog was necessary for her mental health. The author might have a point about the dog's well-being, but they didn't approach it constructively.\n\nSo, the key here is whether the author's comments crossed the line into harassment. Even if their intention was to help, the tone and delivery were inappropriate. The coworker was vulnerable, and the author's sarcastic remarks could be seen as targeting her personal choices. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how they expressed their concern rather than the concern itself.\n"
