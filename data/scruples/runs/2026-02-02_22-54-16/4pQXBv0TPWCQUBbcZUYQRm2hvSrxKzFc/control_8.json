She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a coworker who got a therapy dog despite having a very busy schedule that leaves the dog alone for most of the day. The author is upset about this and made sarcastic comments, which led to being reported to HR. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Using sarcasm and making jokes about someone's pet, especially in a professional setting, could be seen as unprofessional. Even if the author's intention was to highlight a problem, the method of expressing it through sarcasm might have crossed into harassment territory. Companies often have policies against creating a hostile work environment, and even offhand comments can be problematic if they target someone's personal choices.\n\nThen there's the context of the coworker's mental health. She has a history of trauma and anxiety, and the dog is supposed to provide emotional support. The author's comments dismissed the therapeutic value of the dog and mocked her situation. That could be seen as insensitive, especially in a workplace where mental health is sensitive territory.\n\nHowever, the author's concern isn't unfounded. The dog's welfare is an issue if it's left alone for long hours in a kennel. But the appropriate way to address that would be to raise the concern privately and constructively, not through public sarcastic remarks. The author's approach led to HR involvement and conflict, which suggests that the method was inappropriate, even if the underlying concern had merit.\n\nSo, while the author might have had a valid point about the dog's care, the way they expressed it was unprofessional and contributed to the hostile work environment. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for the manner in which they addressed the issue.\n"
