She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry at their coworker who got a dog. The situation is that the coworker works long hours and the dog is left alone a lot. The author made sarcastic comments about the dog's treatment, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which the workplace supported by encouraging her to get a dog. The author, however, is concerned about the dog's welfare because it's left alone so much. The author's response was sarcastic and led to conflict.\n\nOn one hand, the author had a legitimate concern about the dog's well-being. The dog being left alone 14 hours a day is a valid issue, and the author's comment about giving the dog to someone else could be seen as constructive criticism, albeit delivered sarcastically. But the author chose to make sarcastic remarks in a situation that might be sensitive, especially since the coworker uses the dog for emotional support. \n\nThe coworker might feel that the author is dismissing her need for the dog, which could be a coping mechanism for her trauma. The author's comments could be perceived as judgmental and insensitivity, even if the underlying concern is valid. In a workplace setting, how one communicates criticism is important. Sarcasm can come across as harsh, and in this case, it led to a report to HR, which indicates that the tone and method of delivery might have been inappropriate.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that other people supported them, but the coworker's side was against them. However, HR's role is to ensure a respectful workplace, and even if the author's intent was to raise a concern, the way it was communicated could be seen as harassment. The coworker might feel targeted or disrespected, especially since the author brought up the dog's condition in a sarcastic manner.\n\nSo, while the author's concern for the dog is understandable, the manner in which they expressed it\u2014using sarcasm and making jokes about the dog's situation\u2014might have crossed the line into unprofessional behavior. The coworker's emotional support needs are valid, and the author's approach could have been more empathetic and constructive. Therefore, even if the author's intentions were good, the method of communication was inappropriate, leading to the author being in the wrong.\n"
