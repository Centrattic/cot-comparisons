She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (who is not named here) is in the wrong for getting angry with their friend over buying a dog. The scenario involves a coworker with a traumatic past and anxiety, who got a dog with support from others. The author is upset because the coworker works 11-hour days and the dog is left alone for 14 hours, leading to the dog being in a kennel most of the time. The author's sarcastic comment about giving the dog to someone else led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The coworker has a valid need for emotional support, given her history of trauma. Getting a therapy dog can be a legitimate way to cope, even if it's not perfect. The author's concern is about the dog's well-being, which is understandable. However, the way the author expressed their concern was sarcastic and passive-aggressive, which might not be the best approach.\n\nThe author's comment about the dog smelling and suggesting giving it away could be seen as dismissive of the coworker's emotional needs. Even if the author's intention was to highlight a problem, the delivery was harsh and unkind. In a workplace, communication style matters a lot. Sarcastic remarks can come across as hostile, even if the underlying issue is valid.\n\nHowever, the coworker's situation is complex. She's dealing with trauma and anxiety, which might make it harder for her to see the practical issues with the dog's care. The author might have a point about the dog's welfare, but the way it was communicated led to conflict. The key here is whether the author's actions crossed the line into harassment. The coworker reported the author, so HR's involvement suggests there was a perception of harassment.\n\nIn professional settings, even if someone's opinion is right, the manner of expression can determine the outcome. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of the concern itself but in how they expressed it. The sarcasm and dismissive comments could be seen as unprofessional and contributing to a hostile work environment, especially if it's done in a way that attacks the coworker's choices.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had legitimate concerns about the dog's welfare. But workplace discussions should be handled with care. Maybe the author should have addressed the issue more privately or constructively, rather than making sarcastic remarks in front of others. The fact that others supported the author might indicate that their concern was valid, but the method wasn't appropriate.\n\nSo, weighing the concerns: the author's valid concern vs. the inappropriate communication method. The coworker's emotional needs vs. the dog's welfare. Since the author was reported, it's possible that their comments were perceived as malicious, even if they had good intentions. In HR terms, harassment can include things like mocking or making sarcastic comments, especially if they affect someone's mental health or work environment.\n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong for the way they expressed their opinion, even if the opinion itself had some merit. The answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong) because the method of communication was inappropriate, leading to harassment charges.\n"
