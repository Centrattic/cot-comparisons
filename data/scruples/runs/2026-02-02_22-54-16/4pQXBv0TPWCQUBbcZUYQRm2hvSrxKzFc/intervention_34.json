She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker who got a dog for emotional support but the author is upset because the dog is left alone for 14 hours a day. The author made sarcastic comments, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The coworker has a valid reason for getting the dog\u2014emotional support and past trauma. The author's concern is about the dog's well-being, given the long hours the coworker works. But the author's response was sarcastic and maybe not the best way to address the issue. \n\nThe author is in a workplace, and making sarcastic remarks in that environment could be seen as unprofessional or even harassment, especially if the coworker felt attacked. Even if the author had good intentions, the method of expressing concern was inappropriate. The coworker might have felt that the comments were undermining her need for the emotional support animal. \n\nHR's involvement complicates things. The author's comments led to a report, which suggests that the workplace has policies against harassment or inappropriate behavior. The author might have overstepped by making public sarcastic comments instead of addressing the issue privately or constructively. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern about the dog's welfare is valid. Leaving a dog alone for 14 hours daily without proper care could be neglectful. But the author's approach was flawed. Instead of sarcastic remarks, suggesting alternatives like hiring a dog walker or arranging for someone to check on the dog during the day might have been better.\n\nSo, even though the author's intention was to help the dog, the way they expressed it was unprofessional and potentially harmful. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because their method of addressing the issue was inappropriate for the workplace setting and contributed to the harassment report.\n"
