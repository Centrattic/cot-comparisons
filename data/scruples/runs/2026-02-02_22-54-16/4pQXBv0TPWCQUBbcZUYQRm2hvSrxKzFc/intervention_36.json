She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The coworker has trauma and anxiety, so getting a therapy dog is supposed to help. The author is upset because the coworker works long hours, so the dog is alone a lot. The author made sarcastic comments about the dog's care and got reported to HR.\n\nI should consider both sides. The author's concern is valid\u2014the dog might not get enough attention. But the way they expressed it was sarcastic and maybe harsh, leading to harassment charges. The coworker might feel attacked, especially since the dog is part of her emotional support. \n\nThe author's intention was to point out a problem, but the method was inappropriate. Sarcastic remarks in a professional setting can be seen as unprofessional, even if the concern is genuine. HR's role is to handle workplace conduct, so even if the author's point has merit, the delivery led to the reported issue. \n\nSo, while the author might have a valid concern, their approach was wrong. Therefore, they might be at least partially at fault. But maybe not entirely? The coworker reporting for harassment could be overreacting, but the company's policy might prioritize maintaining a respectful environment. \n\nHmm. Balancing the ethical consideration of animal welfare and the workplace dynamics. The answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they didn't handle it professionally, leading to HR involvement, even if their intention was to help. Alternatively, some might argue the author was right to speak up, but the method was flawed. But in a professional context, the way you communicate matters as much as the message. So AITA might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't address it constructively.\n"
