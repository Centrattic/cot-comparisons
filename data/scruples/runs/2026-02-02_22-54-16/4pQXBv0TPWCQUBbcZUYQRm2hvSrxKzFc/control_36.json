She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker who got a dog for emotional support, but the dog isn't getting enough attention because she works long hours. The author got annoyed and made sarcastic comments, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The coworker has a valid reason for getting a therapy dog, especially given her trauma and anxiety. Therapy animals are supposed to provide comfort, but in this case, the dog is left alone for most of the day, which isn't ideal. The author expressed their concerns sarcastically, which probably wasn't the best approach. \n\nThe key here is how the author handled their concerns. Instead of approaching the friend respectfully and offering help, they made sarcastic remarks. Even if the author's concern was valid, the method of communication was inappropriate. Using sarcasm and comments like suggesting the dog is better off with someone else, or comparing it to Netflix, could be seen as dismissive of the friend's emotional needs and the dog's well-being.\n\nAlso, the coworker ended up reporting the author for harassment. Although the author might have had a point about the dog's care, the tone and delivery of their comments were unprofessional and hurtful. The friend felt attacked, which is why she took the action she did. The author's intention might have been to highlight a problem, but the way they communicated it crossed a line.\n\nIn organizational settings, how you express concerns matters a lot. Even if you're right, the manner in which you present your argument can lead to negative consequences. The author could have privately talked to the friend about their worries about the dog's well-being, perhaps suggesting alternatives like a different pet or additional help. But instead, they chose a public and sarcastic approach, which led to conflict.\n\nSo, while the author might have a valid concern regarding the dog's living conditions, the way they expressed it makes them at fault. The answer would be that the author is in the wrong because their response was unprofessional and hurtful, even if their concern was legitimate.\n"
