She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a coworker who got a dog for emotional support but ends up not being able to care for it properly due to her long work hours. The author got annoyed, made sarcastic comments, and now they're being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The coworker has a history of trauma and uses the dog as a therapy animal. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being because the coworker is away most of the time, leading to the dog being in a kennel for long hours. The author's sarcastic remarks about the dog's care led to being reported for harassment.\n\nNow, breaking it down. The author's concern might be valid\u2014keeping a dog in a kennel for 14 hours a day isn't ideal. But their method of expressing that concern was sarcastic and dismissive, which could be seen as unkind or unprofessional, especially in a workplace setting. The coworker's perspective is that the dog is helping her through a tough time, and the author's comments might have come across as invalidating her needs.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were appropriate. While the concern for the dog's welfare is understandable, the way it was communicated led to conflict and a formal report. The author might not be entirely wrong in their concern, but the manner of expressing it definitely contributed to the situation. The coworker's right to emotional support animals is protected, but the author's sarcastic approach might not be the best way to address it.\n\nHowever, the author's main point is about the dog's treatment. The question is about whether they're in the wrong. The coworker reported them for harassment, but the author's intention was to point out the problem. The issue here is balancing concern for an animal with workplace dynamics and communication style.\n\nIn HR terms, the author's sarcastic comments could be considered unprofessional, leading to a harassment claim even if the intent was to help. The coworker might feel attacked, and the author's approach didn't consider the sensitivity of the situation. So, while the author's concern is valid, the method was inappropriate, leading to them being in the wrong in terms of workplace conduct.\n"
