She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nSo, the coworker has anxiety from past trauma and got a therapy dog. The writer is her friend but is annoyed because she works long hours, so the dog is left alone a lot. The dog ends up in a kennel most of the time, which is bad for the animal. The writer made a sarcastic comment about giving the dog to someone else, which led to being reported to HR. Now, the writer feels like they're being painted as the villain even though they were the only one to speak up.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the treatment of the dog, the writer's comment, and the resulting HR report. Let's break it down. Therapy dogs are supposed to provide emotional support, but if the owner can't spend enough time with the dog, is that a problem? The writer's concern is valid in terms of the dog's welfare. However, the way the writer expressed their concern was sarcastic and dismissive, which isn't helpful. The coworker might feel attacked, especially since she's already under stress from her trauma. \n\nBut then, the writer is also pointing out a real issue. The dog isn't being properly cared for, which is a serious problem. The writer did raise the concern, albeit poorly. The question is whether the writer's approach was wrong. In terms of workplace behavior, sarcastic comments can be seen as harassment, even if the intent was to help. The coworker might not have taken it that way, especially since she's sensitive due to her trauma. HR probably looked at the comment as unprofessional and offensive. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworker got a dog that she can't properly care for, which is a problem. The writer tried to speak up, but it backfired. So, the writer isn't entirely in the wrong because the situation with the dog is a real issue. However, the method of addressing it was inappropriate. So the answer might be a mix, but since the options are only A or B, I need to decide if the writer is in the wrong. \n\nIf the writer's comment was harassment, then they are at least partially at fault. But if the underlying issue is valid, maybe they're not entirely wrong. The coworker reported them, but maybe she's not handling the dog well either. It's a tricky situation. The writer's intention was to help, but the delivery was bad. So the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) because of the sarcastic comment leading to harassment charges, even if the concern was valid. But some might argue B because the situation itself is problematic.\n"
