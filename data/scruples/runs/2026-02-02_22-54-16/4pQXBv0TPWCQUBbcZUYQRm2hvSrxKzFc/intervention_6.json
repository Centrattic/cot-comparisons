She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation is that a coworker got a dog for emotional support, but the author is upset because the coworker works long hours and the dog is left alone most of the time. The author made sarcastic comments about the dog being in a kennel and suggested giving it up, leading to HR involvement.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the author's actions. They expressed their opinion sarcastically and made a joke about Netflix. Sarcastic remarks can be seen as unprofessional, especially in a workplace. Even if their concern is valid about the dog's welfare, the way they expressed it might have crossed a line. \n\nThe coworker reported the author to HR, which indicates that the comments were taken as harassment. The author's intention might have been to point out the problem, but the method was inappropriate. The employer's response leaning on the coworker's side suggests that the comments were not well-received and possibly harmful, even if the author's intent was to help.\n\nAlso, the coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, so the author's comments could be seen as insensitive, even if they were trying to be honest. The workplace environment should avoid such remarks to maintain a respectful atmosphere.\n\nSo, while the author's concern about the dog's well-being is understandable, the way they communicated it was unprofessional and could be considered harassment. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
