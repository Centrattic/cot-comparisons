She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry at their coworker for getting a dog. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, and the author is concerned about the dog's welfare because the coworker works long hours. The author made sarcastic comments which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker has emotional support needs, so getting a therapy dog might be a legitimate way to manage her anxiety. However, the author raises a valid point about the dog's living conditions\u2014being alone for 14 hours a day. Dogs need more than just being left in a kennel; they need exercise, social interaction, and proper care. The author's concern about the dog's well-being is understandable.\n\nBut the author expressed these concerns in a sarcastic and dismissive manner. Saying things like \"Give the dog to an owner who can care for it\" and comparing it to Netflix might come off as harsh and insensitive. Even if the author's intentions were to highlight the problem, the delivery was unkind. The coworker might have felt attacked, especially since she's already dealing with trauma and anxiety. The fact that she reported the author to HR suggests that the comments were perceived as harassment, which could be valid depending on company policies.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's criticism is based on a genuine concern for the dog. The coworker might not be considering the dog's needs properly, and the author is pointing out a potential issue. But in a workplace setting, it's important to address concerns respectfully. The author should have approached the situation differently, perhaps by offering advice on how the coworker can improve the dog's care without making sarcastic remarks.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions might be good, the method of expressing them was inappropriate. The answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because their approach was unprofessional and contributed to a hostile work environment, even if the concern was valid.\n"
