She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong here. The situation involves a coworker who got a dog for emotional support, but the author is concerned because the coworker works long hours and the dog is left alone most of the time. The author made sarcastic comments about the dog's care, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the author. They were concerned about the dog's welfare, thinking it's being left in a kennel for too long. Their comments were sarcastic, which might have been inappropriate. But their intention was to point out a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker sees the dog as a therapy animal for her mental health. The author's remarks could be seen as dismissive of her needs and judgmental. Even if the author was trying to be helpful, sarcasm and harsh comments can come off as cruel or unkind, especially when discussing someone's emotional support animal.\n\nHR got involved because the coworker felt harassed. The author's comments might be seen as undermining the coworker's mental health support, which is protected in many places. Even if the author's concerns are valid, the way they expressed them was probably not the right approach. Instead of making sarcastic remarks, they could have suggested alternatives or discussed their concerns more respectfully.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't handle their concerns appropriately, leading to a hostile work environment. But the coworker's situation with the dog's care is also questionable. However, the main issue here is the author's method of expressing their concerns. The answer would depend on whether the comments were harassment or valid concern expressed poorly.\n\nIn many cases, even if there's a valid point, the delivery matters. Sarcasm and cutting remarks can be considered harassment, especially in a workplace. The author's comment about Netflix was particularly dismissive and could be seen as cruel. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
