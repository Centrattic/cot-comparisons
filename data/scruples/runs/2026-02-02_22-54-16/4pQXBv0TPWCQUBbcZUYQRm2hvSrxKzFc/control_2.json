She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry with their friend over buying a dog. The situation involves a coworker who has a traumatic past and anxiety, and the author is upset because the coworker can't properly care for the dog due to her long hours. The author made sarcastic comments, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The coworker has legitimate emotional needs, and getting a therapy dog might be a coping mechanism. However, the author's concern about the dog's welfare is valid too. If the dog is left alone for most of the day and ends up in a kennel with hygiene issues, that's a problem. The author's sarcastic remarks were probably meant to highlight the issue, but they came off as harsh and unhelpful, leading to conflict.\n\nThe key points here are intent and the appropriateness of communication. The author might have valid concerns about animal welfare, but the way they expressed it was passive-aggressive and unprofessional. Instead of providing constructive feedback, they used sarcasm, which is more likely to be perceived as harassment, especially in a workplace setting. The coworker might have felt attacked, especially given her history of trauma, which could make her more sensitive to criticism.\n\nHR's involvement suggests that the workplace has policies against harassment, and even if the author's intent was to help, the method was inappropriate. The author's comments did contribute to a hostile work environment, which is a serious issue. However, the coworker's actions in reporting the comment might also be influenced by her own emotional state and the way she's been treated.\n\nBut ultimately, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. While their concern is understandable, the way they addressed it was unprofessional and crossed into harassment. Therefore, the answer is likely A\u2014yes, the author is in the wrong because their comments were inappropriate and contributed to a hostile work environment, despite the underlying issue being valid.\n"
