She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker who got a dog despite having a busy schedule, leading to the dog being alone most of the time. The author expressed their concerns sarcastically, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which was mentioned by the author. The coworkers decided she should get a dog, possibly thinking it would help her. However, the author is concerned about the dog's well-being because she's away 14 hours a day. The author's sarcastic comments about giving the dog away or suggesting alternatives were taken as harassment.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. On one hand, the author had valid concerns about the animal's welfare. The dog being alone for long periods and the kennel smell are issues. The author might believe they were pointing out a problem that others ignored. On the other hand, the way they expressed their concerns was sarcastic and possibly dismissive of the coworker's emotional needs. Sarcasm can come off as harsh, even if the intent is to highlight a problem. The coworker might have felt attacked, especially since the author's comment was taken to HR, which is a serious step.\n\nThe author's intentions are important here. If they genuinely wanted to help and didn't anticipate the sarcastic remark being taken as harassment, they might have good intentions. But the method of communication was problematic. Using sarcasm and making jokes about the dog's situation could be seen as insensitive, especially when directed at someone with a history of trauma. The coworkers supporting the author might see the issue from the animal welfare angle, but the way it was communicated could have exacerbated the situation.\n\nAlso, the coworker's side: she's using the dog as a therapy animal, which is a legitimate need for some people. The author's dismissive comment about Netflix instead of a therapy dog might have invalidated her approach to coping. Even if the author's point about the dog's care is valid, the way it was communicated could have been more constructive.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they raised a valid concern about animal welfare. However, the method of expressing that concern was inappropriate. Sarcasm and jokes in a professional setting can be seen as harassment, especially when it comes to sensitive topics like mental health and animal care. The coworker's reaction and the HR involvement suggest that the workplace culture might prioritize maintaining harmony over addressing such concerns directly, which complicates things.\n\nBalancing both sides: the author had a legitimate concern but expressed it in a way that was unprofessional and hurtful. The coworker, while in a difficult situation, might have acted in the best interest of her mental health but perhaps didn't consider the practical aspects of dog ownership. The author's sarcasm likely worsened the situation, leading to the HR report.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's intentions might not be malicious, but the approach was flawed. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being partially at fault, but maybe not entirely. However, since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and given the context of HR involvement and the sarcastic comment leading to harassment charges, the answer would suggest that the author did have a part in the problem due to their method of communication, even if their concern was valid.\n"
