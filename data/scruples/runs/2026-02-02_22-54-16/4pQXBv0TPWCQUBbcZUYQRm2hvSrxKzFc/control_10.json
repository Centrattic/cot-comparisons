She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is about a coworker who got a dog for emotional support, but the author is upset because the coworker works long hours and the dog is left alone a lot. The author made sarcastic comments about the dog's treatment, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The coworker has a history of trauma and was advised to get a therapy dog. Therapy animals can be important for people with anxiety. However, the coworker's work schedule leaves the dog alone for 14 hours a day. That seems like a welfare issue because dogs need more attention and social interaction.\n\nThe author is concerned about the dog's well-being, which is valid. But how they expressed their concern was sarcastic and perhaps not the best approach. Instead of providing constructive feedback, the author made snide remarks, which could be seen as unprofessional or even harassing, especially since it led to a report to HR.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker might not be aware of how her actions are affecting the dog. The author's intention might have been to help, but the method was inappropriate. The author could have approached the situation more sensitively, maybe by discussing it privately or suggesting alternatives like dog walking services.\n\nLegally, if the coworker reported harassment, the company might take that seriously, even if the author's intent was to help. The author's comments were public and sarcastic, which could be seen as creating a hostile work environment. However, the context of the dog's welfare is a valid concern. It's a tricky balance between workplace etiquette and animal welfare.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author had a point about the dog's care, but the way they addressed it was problematic. The coworker's side had more support, possibly because the author's approach was confrontational. The author might not be in the wrong morally in terms of the dog's care, but they were wrong in how they expressed their concerns, leading to HR involvement.\n\nSo the answer would depend on whether the focus is on the intent versus the method. The author's intent was to highlight a valid issue, but the method was unprofessional and led to conflict. Therefore, the author is partially at fault for the approach, even if their concern was justified.\n"
