She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for getting angry at their friend/fellow coworker for buying a dog. The situation is that the coworker, who has anxiety and a traumatic past, got a dog. The author is upset because the coworker works long hours and commutes a lot, leading to the dog being left alone for 14 hours a day. The author comments sarcastically, suggesting the dog should be given to someone else, leading to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions were appropriate. The coworker has a legitimate reason for needing emotional support, which might include a therapy dog. However, the concern is about the dog's welfare. The author is pointing out that the dog isn't getting proper care due to the coworker's work schedule. But the way the author expressed their concern was sarcastic and possibly hurtful, which led to the coworker feeling attacked.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author might have valid concerns about animal welfare. But the method of expressing those concerns\u2014through sarcasm and passive-aggressive comments\u2014is problematic. The coworker might have felt that their emotional support was being undermined, especially if the therapy dog is a recommended part of their treatment. The HR issue arises because the author's tone and choice of words were seen as harassment, even if the underlying issue is a real concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker's decision to get a dog might not be in the best interest of the animal given their work schedule. However, the author's approach was unprofessional and perhaps not the right way to address the issue. Instead of making sarcastic remarks, perhaps raising the concern more constructively would have been better.\n\nLegally and ethically, harassment in the workplace is taken seriously, regardless of intent. The author's comments, even if meant to be humorous or sarcastic, could be considered unkind or even bullying. The coworker's emotional state might make them more sensitive to criticism, especially regarding their support animal. \n\nSo, while the author's concern about the dog's welfare is understandable, the way they communicated it was inappropriate. The author might not be in the wrong for having the concern, but they are in the wrong for the manner in which they expressed it. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their approach led to harassment charges and they didn't handle the situation professionally.\n"
