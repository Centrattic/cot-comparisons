She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry with their friend over buying a dog. The situation involves a coworker who's had a tough time with trauma and an abusive ex. The coworker's colleagues, including the author, thought she should get a dog for emotional support. However, the coworker works long hours, so the dog is left alone for 14 hours a day. The author is annoyed because the dog isn't getting proper care and training, leading to a smelly kennel. The author's sarcastic comment about giving the dog to someone else got them reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The coworker has a valid need for emotional support, and a therapy dog can be beneficial. However, the dog's welfare is questionable because the owner can't be home enough to properly care for it. The author's concern about the dog's well-being is valid, but the way they expressed it was sarcastic and dismissive, which led to conflict. \n\nThe author's sarcastic remarks, while based on a valid concern, might have been inappropriate. They could have approached the situation differently, perhaps by discussing their concerns more constructively rather than using sarcasm. However, the coworker's actions in reporting the author to HR might be seen as disproportionate, especially if the author's comment was meant to highlight a real issue. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the coworker might be at fault for not considering the dog's needs given her work schedule. The author's intent was to voice a concern, but the method was poor. So, the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but they could have handled it better. The coworker's reaction seems harsh, but the author's initial annoyance and comment were not malicious. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that there's room for better communication.\n"
