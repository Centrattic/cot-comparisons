She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker getting a dog despite having a long work schedule, leading to the dog being left alone a lot. The author expressed sarcastic comments about the situation, which led to HR involvement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was annoyed because the coworker can't properly care for the dog due to her work hours. The author made sarcastic remarks, which were reported as harassment. The coworker's friends support her, but the author is being criticized.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author's comments were inappropriate. Sarcasm can be seen as harsh, especially in a professional setting. Even if the author's intention was to point out a problem, the way it was done might have crossed the line. The coworker's mental health and her need for a therapy dog are factors too. While the author might have valid concerns about the dog's well-being, the method of expressing those concerns was through sarcastic and potentially offensive comments.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author was reported to HR suggests that the remark was perceived as harassment. Companies usually have policies against creating a hostile work environment, even if the underlying concern is valid. The author could have addressed the issue more constructively, perhaps by discussing concerns privately or suggesting alternatives without sarcasm.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker's actions might not be the author's business, and the author might feel it's their right to express concerns. However, in a workplace, it's important to communicate professionally. The author's approach led to conflict and HR involvement, which indicates that the method was inappropriate.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's intentions might have been to help, but the way they expressed their concerns was unprofessional and led to harassment claims. Therefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
