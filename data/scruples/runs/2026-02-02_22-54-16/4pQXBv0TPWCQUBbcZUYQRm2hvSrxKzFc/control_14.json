She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong, with options A or B.\n\nFirst, the context: The author got angry at a coworker who bought a dog, which ends up alone most of the time because the coworker works long hours. The author made sarcastic comments about the dog's treatment, leading to being reported to HR. Now they're feeling like the villain but think they're right.\n\nSo, the key points here. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, and people at work thought getting a therapy dog would help. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being, given the coworker's schedule. The author's comments were sarcastic and maybe a bit harsh, but their intention was to point out the problem. However, the way they expressed it led to conflict and being reported.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author's concern about the dog's welfare is valid. If the dog is left alone for 14 hours daily, it's a legitimate animal welfare issue. The author might be trying to highlight a problem that others are ignoring. However, the method they used\u2014sarcasm and making snide remarks\u2014could be seen as unprofessional and potentially harassment, even if the concern is genuine. \n\nIn a workplace setting, how you express your concerns matters as much as the content. The author chose a sarcastic tone, which might have been perceived as mocking or insensitive, especially considering the coworker's emotional state. Even if the coworker's situation is complicated (trauma, anxiety), the author's approach could be seen as crossing a line, leading to the HR issue. \n\nBut then again, the author might argue that they were the only one voicing a valid concern. The coworker's dog's treatment is indeed questionable, and others might not have addressed it. However, the correct approach would be to address the issue constructively, perhaps through proper channels or in a respectful manner, rather than sarcasm.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the main issue is the inappropriate method of expressing concern, then yes, they could be in the wrong for the way they spoke. However, if the focus is solely on the validity of the concern, they might not be. But in professional environments, the manner of communication is crucial. Sarcastic remarks in a workplace, even if well-intentioned, can be considered unprofessional or harassing, especially if they target someone's personal choices.\n\nTherefore, while the author's concern might be valid, the way they expressed it likely crossed into unprofessional territory, leading to being reported. So, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) for the method, even if the intent was good. However, there's nuance here. Some might argue that the author was right to voice the concern but did it poorly. But the question is about whether they are in the wrong. Given the HR report and the workplace context, their approach was problematic, making them at fault.\n"
