She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a coworker getting a dog despite having a busy schedule, leading to the dog being in a kennel most of the time. The author of the post got annoyed and made sarcastic comments, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker has a history of trauma and uses the dog for emotional support. The author's comments were sarcastic and critical, which can come off as harsh, even if they have a point about the dog's care. The coworker might feel defensive or hurt by the remarks, especially since she's using the dog for therapy. \n\nThe author's intention was to highlight the problem, but the way they did it was through sarcasm and a comment about giving the dog away. That's where the line might have been crossed. Even if the author believes they're right, their method of expressing it could be seen as unkind or dismissive. \n\nAlso, the coworker reported the author to HR, which implies that the workplace environment is sensitive to such comments. The author's response might not be harassment, but it's possible that their tone and choice of words were inappropriate for the workplace setting. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did point out a valid concern about the dog's well-being. However, the approach taken was confrontational rather than supportive. Maybe there was a better way to address the issue without attacking the coworker. \n\nIn summary, while the author had a legitimate concern about the dog's care, the way they expressed it was inconsiderate and led to conflict. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A), but there's nuance here. However, given the HR report and the coworker's reaction, the sarcastic comments were probably unwise, making the author at least partially responsible.\n"
