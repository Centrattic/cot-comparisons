She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a coworker getting a dog despite having a busy schedule, which leads to the dog being left alone a lot. The author expressed their frustration sarcastically, leading to a conflict and being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which the author acknowledges. The coworkers decided she should get a dog for emotional support. The author is concerned about the dog's welfare because she works long hours and commutes a lot. The dog ends up in a kennel most of the time, and the author's sarcastic comment about giving the dog to someone else gets back to HR.\n\nSo, the author's main argument is that the dog isn't being properly cared for. Their concern is valid from an animal welfare perspective. However, the way they expressed it\u2014sarcastically and through comments that might be seen as unsupportive\u2014could be problematic. The coworker might feel attacked, especially given her history of trauma and the emotional support aspect. The author's comment about Netflix is dismissive of her emotional needs, which could be seen as insensitive.\n\nIn terms of company policy, if the coworker reported it as harassment, HR would take that seriously. Even if the author's intentions were to highlight the dog's welfare, the method of expression could be considered unprofessional or harassing. The author's response might have violated workplace communication policies, leading to the HR involvement.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern about animal welfare is legitimate. The coworker's situation might not be ideal for a pet, but the author's approach was harsh. There could be a better way to address this without making sarcastic remarks. Maybe suggesting alternatives or discussing the matter privately instead of publicly commenting.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because the concern is valid. However, the way they expressed it was inappropriate and could be seen as harassment, especially in a workplace setting. HR's role is to maintain a respectful workplace, and even if the comment was meant to be constructive, it came across as negative and unsupportive, which could lead to the author being in the wrong in the eyes of HR and the company.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their method of expressing the concern was unprofessional and led to a harassment report. But there's a nuance here where the concern itself is valid, but the delivery was problematic.\n"
