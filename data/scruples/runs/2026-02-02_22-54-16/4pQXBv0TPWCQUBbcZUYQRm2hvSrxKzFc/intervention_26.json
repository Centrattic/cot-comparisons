She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for getting angry and making sarcastic comments about their coworker getting a dog. \n\nFirst, the situation: The coworker has a lot of stress, trauma from an abusive ex, and people at work encouraged her to get a dog for emotional support. The author is concerned because the coworker works long hours, so the dog would be alone for most of the day. The author points out that the dog isn't getting proper care, leading to issues like a smelly kennel. The author's sarcastic remarks led to being reported to HR, and now they feel like the villain even though others agree with them.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is the author in the wrong for expressing their concern in a sarcastic way? Let's consider the factors. \n\nThe author's concern is valid\u2014keeping a dog in a kennel for so many hours a day isn't ideal. However, the way they expressed it was sarcastic and perhaps dismissive of the coworker's emotional needs. The coworker was already vulnerable, having been through trauma. The author's comments might have been hurtful and unkind, even if their intent was to highlight a problem.\n\nIn the workplace, even if the author's concern is genuine, the method of communication matters. Sarcastic remarks can come off as harsh and unprofessional, especially when addressing someone's personal choices. The coworker might have felt attacked, which could explain why she reported the author. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel they were the only one speaking up, and others didn't voice similar concerns. But the key is how the message is delivered. Even if the concern is valid, the tone and delivery can affect the outcome. \n\nIn HR terms, harassment or unprofessional behavior is often about how actions make others feel. The author's comments, while factual, were delivered in a way that could be seen as mocking, which might justify the coworker's reaction. \n\nSo, balancing the valid concern with the method of communication, the author might not be entirely wrong, but their approach was inappropriate. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. The coworker's feelings and the workplace context suggest that the author's sarcasm crossed a line, making them at least partially responsible for the conflict.\n"
