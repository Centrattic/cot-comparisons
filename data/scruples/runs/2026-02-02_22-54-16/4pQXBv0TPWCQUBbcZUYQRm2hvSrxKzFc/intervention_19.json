She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry at their coworker for getting a dog. The situation involves the coworker having a dog that's left alone for long hours and the author's sarcastic comments leading to an HR report.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The coworker works long hours and commutes, leaving the dog alone. The author is annoyed because the dog isn't getting proper care. They made sarcastic remarks, which were taken as harassment. The coworker reported them to HR, and others seem to support the coworker.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspect. The author's concern might be valid about animal welfare, but how they expressed it was sarcastic and possibly unkind. Even if the author had a point, using sarcasm and making jokes about the dog's situation could come off as insensitive, especially since the coworker is using the dog for emotional support. The author's comments might have been inappropriate in a professional setting, leading to the HR issue. \n\nHowever, the coworker's actions might also be questionable, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing. The author's approach was to voice their concern through sarcasm instead of a constructive conversation. That's where they might be in the wrong. But maybe the author's intention was to highlight the dog's poor living conditions, which is a genuine concern. \n\nBut in a workplace, even if someone has a valid point, the method of communication matters. The author's sarcastic remarks could be seen as unprofessional and contributing to a hostile environment. Even if others agree with the author's sentiment, the way they expressed it led to HR involvement. So, the author's approach was probably inappropriate, making them at least partially at fault for the situation, even if their underlying concern was valid.\n"
