She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for their reaction to a coworker getting a dog. The situation involves a coworker with a history of trauma and anxiety getting a therapy dog, but the author is upset because the dog will be left alone for long hours and not properly trained. The author made sarcastic comments which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The coworker has valid emotional support needs, and a therapy dog can be beneficial. However, the author's concern is about the dog's welfare. Leaving a dog alone for 14 hours daily is indeed problematic. The author's sarcastic remarks might be seen as crossing a line, even if their intention was to highlight the issue.\n\nBut the coworker's side has more support from others, possibly because they are in a vulnerable position. The author's comments, while critical, were made in a way that could be perceived as harsh and unempathetic. Even if the author's concern was valid, the method of expressing it (sarcastic and dismissive) could contribute to why they were reported. HR might see it as harassment regardless of the intent. \n\nHowever, the coworker's actions in reporting the author for a sarcastic comment might be seen as overreacting, especially if the comment was meant to express concern. But the key here is the context: the coworker is in a sensitive position, and the author's tone might have been inappropriate. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of concern but in how they communicated it. So, the answer might be A (Yes) because the author's approach was inappropriate, even if their concern was valid.\n"
