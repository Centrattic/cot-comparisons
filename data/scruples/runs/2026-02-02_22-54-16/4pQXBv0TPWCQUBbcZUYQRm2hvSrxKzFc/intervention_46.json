She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry with a coworker who bought a dog despite having an impossible schedule. The author made sarcastic comments and was reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which is valid. The team thought a therapy dog would help her. The author is concerned because the coworker works long hours and the dog would be alone most of the time. The author's sarcastic remark about the dog being given to someone else was probably meant to highlight the problem, but it came across as harsh.\n\nNow, the key points: The author voiced their opinion in a sarcastic way, which led to a report. The coworker felt attacked, and others might have taken the author's comments as unkind. Even if the author had a valid concern, the delivery was inappropriate. Therapy animals require proper care, but the author didn't offer a solution, just a sarcastic comment. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the coworker's well-being is important, especially with her history. But the author's comment was dismissive and sarcastic, which is not a good way to handle the situation. The author might have thought they were being helpful, but the method was not constructive. So, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their approach was inappropriate even if their concern was valid. Alternatively, if the concern is valid, maybe B (No) because they were pointing out a real issue. But the way they did it is the problem here. HR probably saw it as harassment because it's a hostile comment, regardless of intent. So probably A is the correct answer.\n"
