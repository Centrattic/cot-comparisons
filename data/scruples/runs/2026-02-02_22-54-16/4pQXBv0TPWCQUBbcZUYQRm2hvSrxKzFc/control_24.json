She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The situation is about a coworker who got a dog, but the author is upset because the dog is left alone for long hours and the coworker isn't taking proper care of it. The author made sarcastic comments and now got reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. They made a sarcastic remark suggesting giving the dog to someone else. The coworker considered it harassment. The author's intention was to point out the problem, but the method was sarcastic and maybe not the best approach.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker has a history of trauma and uses the dog for emotional support. The author might be right about the dog's welfare, but the way they expressed it led to conflict. HR might see it as a workplace issue, especially if it came across as personal attacks.\n\nThe key points are: the author's tone and delivery, the coworker's emotional needs, and the workplace environment. The author's comments could be seen as unkind and unprofessional, even if their concern was valid. The coworker reported them, which affects the work environment. So, even if the author's intent was to highlight the dog's poor treatment, the method was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
