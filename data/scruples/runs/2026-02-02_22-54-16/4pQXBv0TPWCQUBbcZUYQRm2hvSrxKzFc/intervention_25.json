She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a coworker who got a dog, but the writer is upset because the dog is left alone for long hours and not properly trained. The writer made sarcastic comments and was reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the writer's intentions. They were concerned about the dog's well-being, given the coworker's long hours. But the way they expressed their concern\u2014sarcastically\u2014might have been inappropriate. The coworkers might have felt the comments were harsh or offensive, even if the underlying concern was valid.\n\nNext, the coworker who got the dog reported the writer. That's a red flag. Even if the writer had valid points, using sarcasm and making jokes about giving the dog away could come off as cruel, especially in a professional setting. The key here is whether the method of expressing concern was respectful and constructive.\n\nThe writer mentions that the coworker uses the dog for emotional support. The writer's sarcastic remarks about alternatives like Netflix might have dismissed the coworker's need for emotional support, which could be seen as insensitive. In a workplace, even if you disagree with someone's decisions, it's important to address concerns professionally to avoid conflicts and HR issues.\n\nThe writer's defense is that others agreed with them, but the outcome was being labeled an asshole. That suggests that while the sentiment might be shared, the delivery was problematic. The coworker's trauma and the dog's welfare are both valid points, but the writer's approach wasn't the right way to handle it. \n\nSo, considering the context, the writer's intentions might be understandable, but their actions were unprofessional and led to HR involvement. Therefore, the answer would be that the writer is in the wrong for the way they expressed their concerns rather than the concern itself.\n"
