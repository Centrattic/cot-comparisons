She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a coworker who got a dog, but the author is upset because the coworker can't properly care for it due to her long hours.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, and the workplace suggested a therapy dog. The author is annoyed because the dog will be left alone for 14 hours a day. The coworker is struggling with training, the dog is in a kennel most of the time, and the author made sarcastic comments which led to being reported to HR.\n\nThe author's main argument is that the dog isn't getting proper care. They made a sarcastic remark, which the coworker took as harassment. The author feels they were the only one speaking up, hence the question about being in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering the coworker's situation: she's dealing with trauma, and the dog is supposed to be emotional support. The workplace might have encouraged the dog for her mental health. The author's comments, while maybe well-meaning, were sarcastic and potentially harsh. Even if they had a point about the dog's care, the way they expressed it led to conflict and HR involvement.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they voiced their concern in a sarcastic and passive-aggressive way, which isn't constructive. They could have approached the coworker directly or discussed it with others in a more respectful manner. By making a joke about giving the dog away, they might have come across as insensitive, especially to someone already under stress. The coworker felt attacked, leading to HR being involved. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern about the dog's welfare is valid. The dog being left alone for long periods is a legitimate issue. However, the method of expressing this concern was inappropriate. The author should have addressed the issue more thoughtfully rather than making sarcastic remarks.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions might have been to highlight a real problem, the approach was wrong. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong for how they communicated their concern.\n"
