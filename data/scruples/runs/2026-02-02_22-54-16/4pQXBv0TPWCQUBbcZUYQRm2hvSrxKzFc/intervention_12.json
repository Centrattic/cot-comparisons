She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry at their coworker for getting a dog. The situation is that the coworker has a lot of emotional issues, like anxiety and a traumatic past. The coworkers decided she should get a dog for emotional support. The author is upset because the coworker works long hours and commutes a lot, so the dog would be alone most of the time. The author made sarcastic comments about the dog's situation and ended up getting reported to HR. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants to know what I think.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The coworker has a valid need for emotional support, and getting a dog is a common way to help with that. However, the author is pointing out a practical issue: the dog might not be well-cared for due to the coworker's schedule. The author's sarcastic remarks, while maybe well-intentioned, came across as harsh and led to conflict.\n\nIs the author right to voice their concern? It's possible that the author had a valid concern about the dog's welfare, but the way they expressed it was inappropriate. Sarcasm and making jokes about someone's emotional support animal can be seen as dismissive and hurtful, even if the underlying concern is valid. The coworker might feel that her mental health needs are being criticized, which could explain why she took offense and reported the author.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that they were protecting the dog's welfare by pointing out the potential neglect. But in a professional setting, it's important to address such issues respectfully and through appropriate channels rather than making sarcastic remarks. The author's direct comments led to a conflict and HR involvement, which complicates the situation.\n\nSo, while the author's concern about the dog's care might be valid, the approach they took was unprofessional and contributed to the conflict. They could have raised the issue in a more constructive manner, perhaps by discussing their concerns with the coworker privately or involving a supervisor if necessary. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because their method of expressing their concern was inappropriate, even if the concern itself was justified.\n"
