She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, and people at work suggested getting a dog for emotional support. The author is upset because the coworker works 11-hour days with a 90-minute commute, which means the dog is alone for 14 hours. The coworker isn't able to properly train the dog, so it's spending most of its time in a kennel. She then asks for advice about the smell, and the author makes a sarcastic comment suggesting giving the dog to someone else. They also mention Netflix as an alternative.\n\nNow, the author got reported to HR for harassment because of these comments. The coworker is defensive, saying it's a therapy dog. The author feels like the only one who spoke up, but HR made them feel like the villain. \n\nI need to determine if the author is wrong. The key points here are about the appropriateness of their response. Sarcasm and harsh comments in the workplace can be problematic. Even if the author has a valid concern about the dog's well-being, the way they expressed it was clearly dismissive and mocking. Saying the dog should be given to someone else and suggesting Netflix instead of a therapy dog is not supportive. It undermines the coworker's emotional support needs and the dog's role in her recovery.\n\nIn a professional setting, it's important to address issues without personal attacks. The author's comment was not just about the dog's care but also belittled the coworker's situation. Even if others agree the situation isn't ideal, the author's method of expressing concern was inappropriate. Harassment in the workplace includes creating a hostile environment, and making sarcastic remarks about a colleague's health and their pet could contribute to that. The coworker might have felt targeted or criticized for her mental health and personal choices. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have been trying to highlight the impracticality of the dog's situation. But instead of offering help or discussing the issue objectively, they made a snide comment. The right approach would have been to talk to the coworker privately, express concern about the dog's welfare, and maybe suggest alternatives without being sarcastic or dismissive. \n\nHR's role is to protect all employees from harassment, so even if the author's intent was to raise a valid point, the delivery was offensive. The coworker might have felt harassed because the comment could be seen as attacking her decision to get a therapy dog, which is related to her mental health. \n\nSo, considering the tone and the context, the author's sarcastic remarks were inappropriate and likely contributed to the hostile work environment, even if their underlying concern was about the dog's well-being. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
