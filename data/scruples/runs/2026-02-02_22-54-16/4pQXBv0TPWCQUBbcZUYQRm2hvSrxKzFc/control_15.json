She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a coworker who got a therapy dog despite working long hours, leading to the dog being left alone most of the time. The author expresses concern about the dog's welfare but is criticized for being harsh.\n\nFirst, the coworker has a valid reason for needing emotional support, given her traumatic past. Getting a therapy dog can be part of her treatment, so there's a basis for her decision. However, the author is worried about the dog's living conditions\u2014being left alone 14 hours a day and spending most time in a kennel. That's a valid concern because dogs need social interaction and exercise.\n\nThe author's response was sarcastic, suggesting giving the dog away. While the concern is legitimate, the way it was communicated (sarcasm) could come off as insensitive. The coworker might feel disrespected, especially if the author is undermining her therapy support. The author might not be in the wrong for the concern itself, but the method of expressing it was inappropriate, leading to conflict and HR involvement.\n\nThe coworker reported the author, which complicates things. Even if the author's intentions were to help the dog, the sarcastic remark could be seen as harassing, especially in a workplace. The key here is whether the author's actions crossed the line into harassment. The coworker's side might be more sympathetic to her therapy dog, making the author look like the antagonist. However, the author's underlying concern is valid. But in terms of workplace conduct, the way the author expressed their concern was unprofessional and likely contributed to being reported. So, the author is in the wrong for the manner of their response, even if the concern is legitimate.\n"
