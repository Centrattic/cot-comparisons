She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, and her colleagues thought getting a dog would help. The author is annoyed because the coworker works long hours and commutes, leading to the dog being alone most of the time. The dog is in a kennel, and the coworker is struggling with the smell. The author made sarcastic comments suggesting giving the dog away or using Netflix, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nSo, the main points are: the coworker's well-being, the dog's care, the author's comments, and the HR report. The author believes the dog isn't being properly cared for, but others side with the coworker. The question is whether the author is wrong for speaking up.\n\nI need to consider if the author's comments were appropriate. Sarcastic remarks in the workplace can be problematic, even if the concern is valid. However, the coworker might be vulnerable due to her trauma. The author's intention was to point out the issue, but the method was harsh. On the other hand, the coworker might be using the dog as emotional support, which is a legitimate need. The author's comments could be seen as dismissive of her mental health. But if the dog's welfare is at risk, maybe there's a valid concern.\n\nHR involvement complicates things. The author's sarcastic remarks might have crossed the line into harassment, even if their underlying concern was genuine. The coworker's trauma could make her more sensitive to criticism, especially about something she sees as helping her. So, while the issue of the dog's care is valid, the way the author expressed their concern was inappropriate. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong because their approach was unprofessional and contributed to a hostile work environment, even if they had good intentions.\n"
