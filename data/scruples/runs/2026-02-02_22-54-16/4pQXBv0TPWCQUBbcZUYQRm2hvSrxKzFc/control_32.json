She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a coworker getting a dog for emotional support, but the author is upset because the coworker works long hours, so the dog is left alone most of the time. The author made sarcastic comments and was reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects here. The coworker has a history of trauma and uses the dog for emotional support, which is a legitimate need. The author's concern about the dog's well-being is valid\u2014leaving a dog alone for 14 hours daily is not ideal. However, the way the author expressed their concern was sarcastic and dismissive, which could be seen as unkind and unhelpful.\n\nThe coworker's response to report the author for harassment suggests that the comments were hurtful. Even if the author's intention was to highlight the problem, sarcasm can come off as cutting and may not be the best approach. The author might have thought they were speaking the truth, but the method used could have been more compassionate and constructive.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker's actions in reporting the author for expressing a sarcastic opinion might be seen as hypersensitive or using HR as a weapon. However, in a workplace, the line between humor and harassment can be thin, and the coworker might have felt the comments were targeting her directly, especially since the dog is part of her emotional support.\n\nThe key factors here are the tone of the author's comments and the context of the coworker's situation. While the author's concern about the dog's welfare is valid, the manner in which it was expressed likely contributed to the conflict. The author could have approached the situation with more empathy, perhaps suggesting alternatives without sarcasm.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for having a concern, but the way they expressed it was inappropriate. However, the coworker's decision to report the author might be an overreaction. But since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether the sarcastic remarks cross into harassment. Since the author was reported and HR got involved, the workplace likely saw the comments as unprofessional. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the delivery, even if the underlying concern is valid. But I need to check if there's a balance here. Maybe the answer is that the author is in the wrong because their method of expression was unhelpful and offensive, even if the concern was genuine.\n"
