She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker getting a dog despite having a busy schedule, leading to the dog being left alone most of the time. The author gets annoyed and makes sarcastic comments, then gets reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, and the dog is supposed to be a therapy animal. The author is concerned about the dog's welfare, which is valid. But how they expressed that concern might be problematic. Sarcasm and comments like suggesting giving the dog away or comparing it to Netflix could come off as harsh, even if the intention was to point out the issue.\n\nThe coworker's perspective is important too. She might feel that the author is undermining her emotional support needs. Therapy animals are prescribed for a reason, so dismissing it as a bad idea could be seen as invalidating her situation. The author's comments might be seen as cruel or insensitive, even if they have a point about the dog's care.\n\nThen there's the HR part. The coworker reported the author for harassment. Even if the author's intentions were good, the sarcastic remarks in a workplace setting can be considered unprofessional. The way the author communicated their concern might not have been appropriate, leading to the harassment claim.\n\nAlso, the author mentions being attacked and that others are on their side. But the coworker's side is against them. The key is whether the author's actions crossed a line. While the concern about the dog's well-being is valid, the method of expressing it was likely inappropriate, leading to the conflict.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's intentions were to highlight a problem, but their approach was offensive. They should have addressed the issue in a more constructive and respectful manner. So the author is in the wrong because their comments were unprofessional and hurtful, even if the underlying concern was valid.\n"
