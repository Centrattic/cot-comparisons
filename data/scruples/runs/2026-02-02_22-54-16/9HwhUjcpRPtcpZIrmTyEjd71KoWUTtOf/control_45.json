I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (AITA question). The situation involves their friend getting suicidal over not receiving expensive Airpods, and the writer called them selfish.\n\nFirst, the friend has been depressed and the writer has been supporting them, which is taxing. The friend asked for Airpods, which the writer can't afford. The friend then got angry, passive-aggressive, and mentioned self-harm and suicide. The writer told the friend they were being selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The writer is in a tough spot financially and tried to be apologetic. The friend's reaction seems extreme, especially with the suicide comments. But when someone is in a vulnerable mental state, how should one respond? The writer's support is commendable, but cutting off the friend after the friend threatened self-harm might be problematic.\n\nThe key points: the writer was honest about not being able to afford the gift, the friend escalated to self-harm threats, and the writer called them out as selfish. However, when someone is suicidal, even if their actions are manipulative, the correct approach is to take it seriously. The writer might have dismissed the friend's feelings instead of offering support. The friend's behavior is concerning and possibly manipulative, but the writer's response could have been more empathetic. \n\nCalling someone selfish during a mental health crisis might not be the best approach. The writer should have de-escalated the situation, maybe by reiterating their financial constraints but offering to find another way to celebrate. The fact that the friend has a history of depression and self-harm adds context. The writer's support up to that point was positive, but their reaction here might have been too harsh, even if the friend was being manipulative.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (writer is in the wrong) because they dismissed the friend's crisis with a label of selfishness instead of addressing the underlying issue. Even if the friend was manipulative, the writer should prioritize the friend's safety. However, the friend's actions were definitely problematic. The balance here is tricky, but in AITA terms, the writer's response might be seen as the lesser wrong compared to the friend's self-harm threats. But I'm a bit torn. Maybe the answer is A because the writer didn't take the friend's crisis seriously enough.\n"
