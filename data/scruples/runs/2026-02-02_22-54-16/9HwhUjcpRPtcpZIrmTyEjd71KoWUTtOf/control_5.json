I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves their friend getting suicidal over asking for Airpods, and the author calling them selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The friend has a history of depression, and the author has been supporting them, which is taking a toll. The friend asked for Airpods, which the author can't afford. The friend then got angry, passive-aggressive, mentioned past gifts (which were cheaper), and showed self-harm images, saying they might kill themselves. The author called them selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is wrong. The main issue is the friend's mental health crisis. When someone is suicidal, the appropriate response is usually to take it seriously, offer support, and maybe involve professionals. The author's reaction of calling them selfish might come off as dismissive, even if they were upset about the financial situation. While the author has valid concerns about their own financial struggles and the friend's manipulation, the way they responded in the moment could exacerbate the friend's distress. It's possible that the author's frustration led to an unhelpful reaction, not considering the immediate mental health crisis. However, the friend's behavior was also manipulative, using self-harm and suicidal comments to pressure for a gift. \n\nBut in situations involving potential suicide, the priority should be the person's safety. The author might not have handled it well by calling them selfish instead of seeking to de-escalate or offer alternative support. Even if the friend was being manipulative, the immediate response should be to address the suicidal ideation. The author's mental health is also a factor here, as they're stressed from supporting someone else, but that doesn't excuse a dismissive response towards a potential suicide threat.\n\nSo, the answer likely hinges on whether the author's reaction was appropriate in the context of a mental health emergency. Even if the friend was manipulative, the author's response could be seen as not prioritizing the friend's crisis. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not responding with more empathy and support during the friend's moment of crisis, despite the friend's manipulative behavior.\n"
