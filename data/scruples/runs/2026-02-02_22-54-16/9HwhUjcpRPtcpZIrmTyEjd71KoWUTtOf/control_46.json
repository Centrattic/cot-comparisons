I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who has depression and a history of self-harm. The friend asked for expensive Airpods as a birthday gift, and when the author couldn't afford it, the friend got upset and made suicidal comments. The author then called the friend selfish and manipulative. The friend ignored them after that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been depressed for a while and has a history of self-harm. The author has been supporting them, which is taking a toll. The friend's request for an expensive gift is out of proportion to what the author can give. The author feels they can't afford it and is honest about it. The friend's reaction is extreme, including passive-aggressive comments and self-harm references. The author's response is to call them selfish, leading to a fallout.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author is honest about their financial situation. They can't afford the gift, so they decline. The friend's behavior is manipulative, using guilt and self-harm to pressure the author. The author's frustration might be justified given the manipulation. However, calling someone selfish when they're struggling with mental health issues can be insensitive. Even if the friend's actions are manipulative, the author's response might not be the best way to handle it. They could have offered alternatives or supported the friend in a different way instead of labeling them as selfish. But the friend's use of self-harm as a manipulative tool is problematic. The author's mental health is also a factor here, as they're being taxed by the friend's demands.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. The author's honesty about their limits is understandable, but their response might not have been the most supportive. However, considering the friend's manipulation and the author's own stress, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. The key point is that the friend's behavior is manipulative, and the author's frustration is valid. However, the way the author addressed it could have been more empathetic. But given the circumstances, maybe the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, the author might be partially at fault for not handling the situation more carefully. But the main issue here is the friend's manipulative tactics. The author's response was a reaction to that manipulation. So, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong), but with some nuance. However, in some perspectives, even if the friend is manipulative, calling them selfish in that moment might not help. But the friend's actions were extreme. I think the answer here is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
