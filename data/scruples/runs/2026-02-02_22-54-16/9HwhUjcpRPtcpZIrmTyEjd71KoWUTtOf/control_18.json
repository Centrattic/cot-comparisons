I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong after calling their friend selfish when the friend got suicidal over not receiving Airpods. \n\nFirst, the friend has a history of depression and the author has been supporting them. The friend asked for Airpods as a birthday gift, but the author couldn't afford it. The friend then responded with passive-aggressive comments and sent images of self-harm, leading the author to call them selfish and manipulative.\n\nI need to consider the context. The friend's mental health is a key factor here. When someone is struggling with depression or suicidal thoughts, their reactions can be extreme. The author might be under financial stress, but the friend's response involved self-harm and suicide comments, which are serious.\n\nThe author's reaction was to label the friend as selfish and manipulative. While the author might be frustrated and stressed, responding in a way that could invalidate the friend's feelings, especially during a mental health crisis, could be problematic. The friend's actions, while hurtful, might stem from their own pain and depression, not just manipulation.\n\nIt's important to note that the author tried to apologize and explain their inability to afford the gift. However, the friend's reaction escalated to self-harm and suicidal remarks, which are red flags. The author's response of calling them out as selfish might not be the best approach in such a sensitive situation. It's possible that the author's frustration led them to a harsh reaction, which might not consider the friend's mental state.\n\nOn the other hand, setting boundaries is important. The author isn't obligated to buy expensive gifts, especially when they can't afford it. But how they communicated that might have played a role. The friend's behavior was indeed manipulative, using self-harm and suicide as leverage to guilt-trip the author into complying.\n\nHowever, in situations involving potential self-harm or suicide, the priority should be the person's safety. The author's reaction might have been a moment of frustration, but the friend's actions require immediate concern. The author might not be in the wrong for setting a boundary, but the way they handled the situation could have been more compassionate.\n\nIn conclusion, while the friend's behavior was manipulative, the author's response of calling them selfish might not be entirely their fault, but they could have handled it more sensitively. However, the primary responsibility isn't on the author for the friend's actions, but they might have made the situation worse with their reaction. The answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, but they should consider better communication strategies next time.\n"
