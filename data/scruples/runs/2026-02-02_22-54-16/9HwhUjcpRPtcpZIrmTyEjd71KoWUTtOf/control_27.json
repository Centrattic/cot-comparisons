I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's been depressed, and the author is supporting them. The friend then asks for expensive Airpods as a birthday present, and when the author can't afford it, the friend gets angry, passive-aggressive, and even mentions suicide. The author calls the friend selfish and manipulative, and the friend ignores them after.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has a history of depression, and the author has been trying to support them. The author is in a financial tight spot, which is a valid reason for not being able to afford the gift. The friend's reaction is extreme\u2014bringing up self-harm and suicide, which is serious. \n\nThe author's response was to call the friend selfish and manipulative. That might come off as harsh, especially considering the friend's mental state. Even though the author was stressed about their own financial situation and the friend's manipulative behavior might be triggering, using such strong language could have been hurtful. However, the friend's actions (threatening self-harm) are concerning and might justify the author's frustration.\n\nBut wait, the author does take responsibility for their own mental health by saying it's taxing them. They also apologized for not being able to afford the gift. The friend's reaction, however, seems disproportionate and potentially manipulative. The key point is whether the author's response was appropriate given the situation. \n\nCalling someone selfish in the context of a friend in crisis might not be the best approach. Even if the friend was manipulative, the author's words could have escalated the situation. The friend's mention of suicide is a red flag that requires empathy and concern rather than judgment. However, the author was likely stressed and overwhelmed, which might have influenced their reaction.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's behavior\u2014using passive-aggressive comments, bringing up self-harm, and making suicide threats to pressure the author into buying an expensive gift\u2014is definitely problematic and could be seen as manipulative. The author's frustration is understandable, but their response might not have been the healthiest way to handle it.\n\nSo considering all this, the author's mistake was not in being honest about their financial constraints but in how they responded\u2014using harsh words when the friend was in a vulnerable state. The correct approach might have been to reaffirm support and suggest alternative ways to celebrate the birthday, rather than labeling the friend as selfish. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for their response, even if the friend's actions were inappropriate.\n"
