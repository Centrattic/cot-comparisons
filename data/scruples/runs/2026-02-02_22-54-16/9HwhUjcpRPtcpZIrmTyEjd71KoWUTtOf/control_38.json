I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who called their friend \"selfish\" is in the wrong after the friend reacted with suicidal comments. \n\nFirst, the friend has been depressed for a while, and the author has been supporting them. The friend asked for expensive Airpods as a birthday present. The author, who's struggling financially, couldn't afford it and said no. The friend then got angry, passive-aggressive, and even sent pictures of self-harm, mentioning suicide. The author responded by calling them selfish and manipulative.\n\nNow, considering the context, the friend's mental health is a significant factor. When someone is dealing with depression or suicidal thoughts, their actions and reactions might be influenced by their emotional state. The friend's history of depression might mean that their behavior isn't just about wanting Airpods but could be a cry for help or a manifestation of their deeper emotional pain.\n\nThe author tried to set a boundary by saying they couldn't afford the gift. That's reasonable, but the friend's reaction escalated quickly. The author called them out for being manipulative, which might have been an attempt to address the guilt-tripping, but in the heat of the moment, especially with someone in distress, such a response could feel harsh. Even if the author was apologetic, the friend's state might make them perceive the refusal as rejection, leading to self-harm comments.\n\nHowever, the friend's behavior\u2014using self-harm and suicidal threats as leverage to get what they want\u2014is manipulative. The author is right to point out that this is manipulation. But the way they responded (\"selfish and manipulative\") might not be the best approach when dealing with someone in crisis. It's important to balance asserting one's limits with compassion.\n\nSo, the author isn't entirely wrong for setting a boundary and pointing out manipulation, but their response might not have been the most supportive during a mental health crisis. However, the friend's actions in using self-harm to guilt-trip are definitely problematic. The key here is whether the author's words contributed to the problem. They might not be the main issue here, but the situation is complex. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because the friend's manipulation is the bigger issue, but there's a nuance that both could have handled it better. However, given the friend's history and the manipulation, the author's response was a valid boundary, so B.\n"
