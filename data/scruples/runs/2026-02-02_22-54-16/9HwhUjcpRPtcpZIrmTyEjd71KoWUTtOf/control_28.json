I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who is depressed, and the author is struggling financially. The friend wanted AirPods for his birthday, and when the author couldn't afford them, the friend got angry, passive-aggressive, and even mentioned self-harm. The author called the friend selfish and manipulative, which led to the friend ignoring them.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The author has been supporting their friend through depression, which is taxing on them. The friend's request for an expensive gift (AirPods) when the author is low on money is a key point. The author tried to be apologetic but the friend reacted poorly, including threats of self-harm. The author's response was to label the friend as selfish and manipulative, which the friend then ignored.\n\nDepression can affect someone's behavior, but that doesn't make their actions acceptable. However, the friend's mention of self-harm is a serious red flag. The author might have been under stress from their own financial situation and the mental load of supporting a friend. But when someone is in a vulnerable state, even if their actions are unkind, the appropriate response is often to de-escalate and seek help rather than confront them with accusations. \n\nCalling someone \"selfish\" when they're expressing suicidal thoughts could be counterproductive. The author might not have considered the emotional state of the friend in that moment and instead reacted with frustration. The friend's behavior was definitely manipulative, but the author's response of labeling them might not be the healthiest approach. However, the situation is complex. The author had a right to set boundaries with their finances, but the way they communicated that after the friend's threats might have been harsh.\n\nAnother angle: the friend's actions (self-harm, suicide comments) are serious. The author's immediate response should have been to express concern and offer support, not to accuse. Accusations can push someone further into crisis. So, even though the friend was being difficult, the author's response might have exacerbated the situation. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for how they handled the conversation, despite the friend's manipulative behavior.\n\nBut wait, the author was also under stress and had been supporting the friend for a while. They might have been overwhelmed and snapped. However, in a crisis, it's important to prioritize the friend's safety. Instead of calling them out, the author should have checked on their well-being and maybe suggested getting professional help. So, the author might be partially at fault for not handling the situation with more care and empathy in the moment.\n"
