I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after calling their friend selfish when the friend got suicidal over not getting Airpods. \n\nFirst, the friend has a history of depression and the author has been trying to support them, which is taxing on the author. The friend asked for an expensive gift\u2014Airpods\u2014while the author is struggling financially. The author refused, apologizing, but the friend became upset, passive-aggressive, and even sent images of self-harm and suicidal comments. The author then called the friend selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nNow, considering the context, the author is in a difficult position. They're under financial stress and have been supporting a friend with depression. When the friend uses emotional manipulation, including self-harm and suicide threats, to guilt the author into buying an expensive gift, the author's reaction is to call them out. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the friend's actions are concerning and potentially harmful. The author's financial situation is valid, and they have a right to set boundaries. However, calling someone selfish in the context of their mental health issues might not be the best approach. But the friend's behavior was manipulative and escalated the situation. \n\nThe key points are the friend's mental health history and the manipulation tactics used. The author is not in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially when the friend's demands crossed into emotional manipulation. The author's reaction, while harsh, is in response to the friend's actions. So, the answer is likely B (Not the Asshole), but I need to confirm if the author's words were justified given the context. The friend's suicidal comments are severe, but the author's financial constraints are real. The author's call-out might be warranted as a reaction to manipulation, but they could have handled it more sensitively. Still, the main issue is the friend's behavior, so the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
