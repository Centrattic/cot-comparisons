I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend with depression who gets upset over not getting Airpods for his birthday and then threatens suicide. The author called the friend selfish and manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is struggling financially and has been supporting their friend emotionally. The friend has a history of depression and uses passive-aggressive behavior and self-harm to manipulate. The author apologized for not being able to afford the Airpods but was met with hostility and threats. \n\nThe key points here are the friend's mental health issues and the author's financial constraints. The author tried to be considerate but was pushed too far. However, the friend's response was extreme and potentially harmful. The author's reaction\u2014calling the friend selfish\u2014seems like a response to manipulation. But was it the right way to handle it? \n\nAlternative approaches might have been to express their financial limits more compassionately while still acknowledging the friend's feelings. However, given the friend's history and the immediate threat of self-harm, the author might have been overwhelmed. The friend's actions (self-harm, suicidal comments) are serious and suggest a need for professional help, not just the author's intervention.\n\nBut the question is about the author's fault. The author was honest about their ability to give a gift and apologized. The friend's reaction was disproportionate. However, the author's response was to call them selfish, which could be seen as invalidating their emotions. But given the manipulation involved, it's a tough call. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the friend's actions are more concerning. The author is not responsible for the friend's mental health but might be expected to respond with more empathy, even if the friend is being manipulative. However, the author was already mentally taxed from supporting the friend. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because the friend's actions were manipulative and harmful. The author had the right to set boundaries, even if their wording was harsh. The responsibility for the friend's self-harm lies with the friend, not the author. So the answer should be B.\n"
