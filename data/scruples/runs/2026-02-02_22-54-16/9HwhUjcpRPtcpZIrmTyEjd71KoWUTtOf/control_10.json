I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's been depressed, and when the writer (who's trying to support them) can't afford to buy Airpods for their birthday, the friend gets angry, passive-aggressive, and even threatens suicide. The writer calls the friend selfish and manipulative, then they ignore each other.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The writer is in a tough spot financially and has been supporting their friend mentally. They tried to communicate their inability to buy the expensive gift. But the friend's reaction was extreme\u2014bringing up self-harm and threats. The writer's response was to call them out on being selfish, which might be harsh given the friend's mental health issues.\n\nBut the friend's actions\u2014using passive-aggression, guilt-tripping, and mentioning self-harm\u2014are concerning. The writer might have felt hurt or frustrated, but responding with \"selfish and manipulative\" right after the friend's emotional outburst could be seen as not taking their mental health seriously. However, the friend's behavior was manipulative regardless, pushing for a gift they can't afford and then threatening suicide as a ploy.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer was upfront about their financial situation and apologized. They might have been trying to set boundaries, which is okay. But when the friend escalated to self-harm, the appropriate response might have been to de-escalate or offer support, not accuse them of being selfish. The line between standing up for oneself and being insensitive is thin here.\n\nI think the key is how the writer handled the situation after the friend's self-harm threats. Calling someone selfish at that moment could make the friend feel even more isolated. Mental health crises require compassion, and the writer might have not considered the emotional impact of their words. However, the friend's manipulation is on their own part for using their depression as a guilt trip.\n\nSo, the writer might be partially at fault for not responding with more empathy during their friend's emotional crisis. Even if the friend was manipulative, the writer's choice of words could have been hurtful. But the friend's behavior was also clearly problematic. Still, in such situations, the person showing signs of self-harm needs immediate support rather than criticism. Therefore, the writer is in the wrong for their response. Answer A.\n"
