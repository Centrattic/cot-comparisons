I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling their friend selfish after the friend got suicidal over airpods. \n\nFirst, the friend is already dealing with depression and has been supported by the author. The friend asked for Airpods as a birthday gift, which the author can't afford. The author is in a tight financial situation and politely declines. The friend reacts with anger and passive-aggressiveness, then sends images of self-harm and mentions suicide. The author then calls the friend selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nSo, the main issue here is how the author handled the situation. When someone is in crisis, especially with suicidal thoughts, the immediate response should be to prioritize their safety. The author's reaction was to label the friend as selfish instead of addressing the underlying emotional distress. Even though the friend's request was unreasonable, the context of their depression and self-harm makes the situation more complex. The author should have focused on offering support, perhaps suggesting alternative ways to celebrate the birthday without financial strain, rather than placing blame. Calling someone selfish in such a vulnerable moment can be hurtful and may exacerbate their feelings of isolation. Therefore, the author's response was inappropriate, making them the asshole in this scenario.\n"
