I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend with depression who becomes upset over not getting Airpods for his birthday. The author, who's been supporting the friend emotionally, says they can't afford Airpods and the friend responds with passive-aggressive comments, self-harm, and suicidal threats. The author calls the friend selfish and manipulative, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has a history of depression, which the author is aware of. The author is also in a tough financial situation. The friend's reaction is extreme\u2014self-harm and suicidal comments. The author's response was to call the friend selfish, which might be seen as dismissive of their emotional state.\n\nOn one hand, the author is under financial stress and tried to be honest about their inability to afford the gift. They also apologized, which shows they're trying to be considerate. However, when the friend escalated to self-harm and suicide mentions, the author's response was to blame the friend as manipulative. That could be seen as not taking the friend's crisis seriously. Even if the friend's behavior was manipulative, dismissing their emotional pain might be harmful, especially given the history of depression.\n\nBut the friend's actions\u2014using self-harm and suicidal threats to pressure for a gift\u2014are manipulative and unhealthy. The author might feel justified in calling them out on that. However, in a situation where someone is depressed and potentially in crisis, the appropriate response is usually to de-escalate and seek help, not to accuse them of being selfish. The author might not be in the wrong for setting a boundary about finances but could have handled the friend's emotional crisis better.\n\nIn terms of the question, the main point is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend's actions are clearly problematic, but the author's response might have been too harsh given the context. However, the friend's manipulation is a significant factor. I think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because they were honest about their financial situation and the friend's response was inappropriate. But the author could have handled the situation better by not dismissing the friend's crisis, which might mitigate the answer. But according to the options, it's either A (wrong) or B (not wrong). Given the friend's manipulative behavior, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for standing their ground, but there's room for improvement in their response. However, calling someone selfish when they're in a mental health crisis might be unhelpful, so maybe the author is in the wrong. Hmm, conflicting thoughts. The key is that the author's response was to label the friend as selfish, which might not be the right approach when someone is in emotional distress. So perhaps the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't adequately address the friend's mental health crisis and instead blamed them, which could exacerbate the problem. Alternatively, considering the friend's manipulation, maybe the author is justified. This is tricky. I think the consensus would be that the author is not in the wrong because the friend's actions were manipulative, but the way the author handled it could be improved. However, according to the options given, the answer is either A or B. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, considering the friend's mental health issues, the author's response, while perhaps not empathetic enough, might not make them the asshole. So maybe B. But if the author didn't take the friend's mental health seriously by calling them selfish, that's a problem. Maybe A. I'm torn. I think the key point is that the author called the friend selfish when they were in crisis. That's probably the wrong move, so A.\n"
