I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after calling their friend selfish following a situation where the friend became suicidal over wanting Airpods. \n\nFirst, the friend has been dealing with depression, and the author has been supportive, which is commendable. The friend asked for Airpods for their birthday, which the author can't afford. The friend then reacted angrily, brought up past gifts (even though the author usually asked for cheaper items), and showed self-harm. When the author confronted them about being selfish, the friend ignored them.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's mental health and the author's response. The friend's threats of suicide and self-harm are serious and can't be ignored. However, the author was in a financial situation where buying Airpods wasn't feasible. The author's frustration led them to call the friend selfish, which might have come across as insensitive, especially given the friend's state.\n\nBut the author was also honest about their inability to afford the gift and apologized. The friend's reaction seems excessive and potentially manipulative, using their mental health and past generosity to guilt-trip the author. However, when someone is in a vulnerable state, even if they're acting out, the appropriate response is usually to de-escalate and offer support, not to label them as selfish. \n\nSo while the friend's behavior was concerning and possibly manipulative, the author's response, though honest, might have been hurtful and not the best way to handle a friend in crisis. The author could have expressed their financial difficulties without dismissing the friend's emotional state, perhaps suggesting an alternative or discussing their mental health instead of calling them selfish. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong for their reaction, even if the friend's actions were problematic.\n"
