I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling their friend selfish after the friend got suicidal over airpods. \n\nFirst, the situation: The friend has been depressed, and the author has been supporting them. The friend asked for Airpods for their birthday, but the author can't afford it. The friend then got angry, passive-aggressive, and even mentioned self-harm and suicide. The author called them selfish and manipulative, leading to a fallout.\n\nSo, the main points to consider here. The friend has a history of depression and has made self-harm comments. The author's friend is in a vulnerable state. The author says they're low on money, which is a valid point. But the friend's reaction escalated quickly, using guilt and making threats.\n\nNow, the author called the friend selfish. Is that justified? Well, the friend was trying to get the author to buy an expensive gift despite the author's financial situation. The author was being honest about not being able to afford it. However, the friend responded with self-harm and suicide threats, which is serious. \n\nThe key issue here is whether the author's response was appropriate. The author was honest, but the friend's mental health is a factor. The author might have expected the friend to push back, but using self-harm as leverage is a red flag. However, calling someone selfish when they're in a mental health crisis might not be the best approach. The author could have expressed their inability to help without using that term, especially given the friend's history.\n\nBut then again, the friend was being manipulative. The author was justified in feeling manipulated. However, the way the author responded might have worsened the situation. Maybe instead of calling them selfish, they should have tried to de-escalate or address the underlying issues of the friend's depression rather than the airpods.\n\nAlso, the friend's actions of threatening suicide and self-harm are serious. The author might have been in a stressful position, trying to balance their own financial limits with supporting a friend. The author's mental health is also taxed from supporting the friend.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author the asshole? The author was honest about their financial situation and called out the friend's manipulative behavior. However, given the friend's mental health crisis, the author's response might have been too harsh. The friend's behavior was concerning, but the author could have handled it more compassionately, perhaps seeking to understand the deeper issues rather than labeling the friend as selfish.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might have been in the right to set boundaries but could have handled it better. However, given the context, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, the friend's actions are more concerning, but the author's response might have been a mistake. It's a tricky situation. I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, but it's close. But considering the friend's mental health and the author's own stress, maybe the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
