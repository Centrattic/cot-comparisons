I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend who's been depressed, and the author can't afford the expensive gift (Airpods) the friend wants for their birthday. The friend gets angry, passive-aggressive, and even threatens suicide, leading the author to call them selfish and manipulative. The friend then ignores them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the mental health aspect. The friend has a history of depression and uses suicidal comments. That's a serious red flag. The author is in a difficult position because they're trying to support a friend but are also financially strained. When the friend brings up the Airpods, the author is honest about not being able to afford it. The friend then reacts poorly, bringing up past gifts (which were cheaper) and makes self-harm comments. The author feels manipulated and calls them out, which might come off as harsh but is a reaction to being guilt-tripped.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, they tried to be apologetic and honest about their financial situation. The friend's response was extreme, using emotional manipulation and threats. The author's frustration leading to calling them selfish is a natural reaction to being guilted. However, responding with \"selfish\" might not be the best approach, but given the context, it's a justified response to manipulation. The key point is the friend's use of mental health issues to pressure the author, which is manipulative. The author isn't ignoring the friend's mental health; they're just setting a boundary. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
