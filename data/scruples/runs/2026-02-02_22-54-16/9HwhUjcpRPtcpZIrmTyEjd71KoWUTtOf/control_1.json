I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who's been depressed for a while, and the writer who's been supporting them. The friend wanted AirPods for his birthday, but the writer couldn't afford it. The friend then got angry, passive-aggressive, sent self-harm pictures, and made suicidal comments. The writer called him selfish and manipulative, and the friend ignored them.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The writer mentions they're low on money and tried to be apologetic when they couldn't buy the AirPods. The friend's reaction seems extreme, with passive-aggression and self-harm. The writer's response was to label the friend as selfish and manipulative. Now, the question is whether the writer is in the wrong.\n\nDepression and suicidal thoughts are serious. The friend might be in a vulnerable state. The writer is under financial stress, but the friend's reaction includes self-harm and suicide comments, which are red flags. The writer called the friend out for being manipulative. But maybe the friend wasn't manipulative; they might be in genuine emotional distress. However, the writer also mentions that the friend usually gave them small, affordable gifts, but this time asked for something expensive. So perhaps there's a pattern of unequal exchange.\n\nWait, the friend's actions\u2014self-harm and suicidal comments\u2014are concerning. Even if the friend is depressed, using such tactics to pressure someone into buying a gift is manipulative. But the line between genuine emotional crisis and manipulation can be thin. The writer might have been frustrated and said something in the heat of the moment. However, the friend's actions are serious and might need a different approach.\n\nThe writer was supporting the friend, but when the friend escalated the situation with self-harm, the writer's response was to call them selfish. Maybe the writer should have de-escalated instead of confronting. But the friend was already in a bad state. On the other hand, if the friend is manipulating their depression to guilt-trip the writer, that's problematic. However, the writer might not know the friend's true intentions. It's possible that the friend is genuinely in crisis and the writer, under stress, responded inappropriately.\n\nIn such cases, the safety of the friend is a priority. If the friend is making suicide comments, the writer should have taken steps to ensure their safety, maybe by involving someone else or a professional. But the writer did respond, albeit harshly. So maybe the writer is not entirely at fault, but their response could have been better. However, calling someone selfish in that context might be seen as dismissive of their real issues.\n\nAlternatively, if the friend is using their mental health to manipulate, then the writer is right to set boundaries. But without knowing the full context, it's hard. The key points are the friend's self-harm and suicide comments. The writer might have been under stress but should have handled it more carefully. However, the friend's actions are extreme. The answer might hinge on whether the friend's behavior was manipulative or genuine crisis. If genuine, the writer should have sought help. If manipulative, the writer's call was justified. The question is whether the writer was wrong to call the friend out.\n\nI think the answer is B (Not the asshole) because the friend's behavior was manipulative, even if they are depressed. The writer was in a tough spot financially and tried to be apologetic. The friend escalated with self-harm and suicide comments, which is using emotional manipulation. The writer called them out, which is a valid response, even if not the best approach. So the writer isn't in the wrong.\n"
