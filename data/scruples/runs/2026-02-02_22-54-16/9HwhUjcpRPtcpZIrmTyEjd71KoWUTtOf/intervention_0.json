I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who is depressed and gets upset when the author can't afford to buy them Airpods for their birthday. The author then calls their friend selfish and manipulative when the friend tries to guilt-trip them into buying an expensive gift. The friend even starts threatening suicide, which is a serious issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they're extremely low on money and tried to be apologetic when they couldn't afford the Airpods. The friend, on the other hand, has a history of depression and uses self-harm and suicide threats as a reaction. The author responded by calling the friend selfish and manipulative. \n\nNow, the key points here are: the author was honest about their financial situation, expressed regret, and set a boundary. The friend's response included self-harm and threats, which are manipulative and emotionally manipulative. The author's response was to point out the manipulation, which might come off as harsh but is a valid reaction to being guilt-tripped. \n\nHowever, when someone is suicidal, especially a friend with a history of depression, the appropriate response is to be supportive and concerned, not to label them as selfish. Even if the friend's actions are manipulative, the immediate priority should be addressing the suicide threat. The author might have been justified in feeling manipulated, but their response could have been more compassionate and focused on the friend's well-being rather than calling them out, which might have escalated the situation.\n\nSo, the author's main mistake was not addressing the suicide threat appropriately. Instead of calling the friend selfish, they should have offered support, maybe offered to help in another way if possible, or encouraged the friend to seek professional help. The friend's behavior is problematic, but the author's response could have been more supportive, especially given the serious nature of the friend's mental health issues. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not prioritizing the friend's crisis over their own feelings about being manipulated.\n"
