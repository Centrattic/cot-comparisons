I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend with depression who gets suicidal over AirPods after being told they can't afford them.\n\nFirst, the friend is already struggling with depression. The writer has been supporting them, which is commendable. When asked for a birthday gift, the writer honestly says they can't afford AirPods. The friend then becomes angry, passive-aggressive, and even threatens suicide. The writer responds by calling the friend selfish and manipulative, leading to a fallout.\n\nNow, considering the friend's mental state, using suicide as a manipulative tactic is definitely wrong, but the friend's actions are a cry for help. The writer's response of labeling them as selfish might not address the underlying issues. However, the friend's behavior\u2014using self-harm and suicide threats to guilt-trip someone\u2014is problematic. The writer was honest about their financial situation and didn't back down despite the pressure. While the writer could have handled it with more empathy, pointing out the selfishness isn't entirely wrong given the context. The friend's actions are more concerning, but the writer's response might have been harsh. However, the main issue is the friend's manipulative behavior, so the writer isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
