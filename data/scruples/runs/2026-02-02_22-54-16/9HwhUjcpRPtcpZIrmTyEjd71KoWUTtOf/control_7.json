I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the friend has been depressed for a while, and the author has been trying to support them. Now, it's the friend's birthday, and they asked for Airpods, which the author can't afford. The author told them they can't buy it, but the friend reacted with passive-aggressiveness, sent pictures of self-harm, and mentioned suicide. The author then called the friend selfish and manipulative, and the friend ignored them.\n\nFirst, the author was already under financial stress and mental stress from supporting their friend. When the friend asked for something expensive, the author honestly couldn't afford it. But the friend's reaction was extreme\u2014self-harm and suicide threats. The author felt that the friend was using their depression to guilt-trip them into buying something expensive, which is manipulative. \n\nBut wait, the friend has a history of depression and self-harm. Maybe the author's response was too harsh? Calling someone selfish and manipulative when they're in crisis might not be the best approach. Even if the friend was being manipulative, the author might have needed to respond differently to de-escalate the situation instead of confronting them directly with those labels. Also, the friend's actions (self-harm and suicide comments) are serious and might require immediate concern rather than assigning blame.\n\nHowever, the author was also strained by the friend's demands and had been supportive for a long time. They were clear about their inability to afford the gift and apologized. The friend's reaction was disproportionate, using self-harm as leverage. The author might feel they were protecting their own well-being by not giving in to manipulation. But in a crisis situation, especially with someone who has mental health issues, the appropriate response is often to seek help rather than argue about right and wrong.\n\nSo, the friend's behavior is concerning and potentially harmful, but the author's response might have been unhelpful. Instead of calling the friend selfish, they might have needed to express concern for their safety and suggest getting professional help. The author's mental health is also a factor here, but the immediate priority when someone threatens suicide is to ensure their safety, even if they're acting out of manipulation. \n\nIn conclusion, while the friend's actions are troubling, the author's response of labeling them as selfish and manipulative without addressing the immediate crisis might have exacerbated the situation. The right approach would be to prioritize the friend's safety and seek support, not assign blame. So, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
