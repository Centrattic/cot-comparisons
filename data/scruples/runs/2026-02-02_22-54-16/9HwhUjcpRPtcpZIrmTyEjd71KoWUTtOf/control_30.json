I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling their friend selfish after the friend had a meltdown over not getting Airpods and mentioned suicide.\n\nFirst, the friend has been depressed for a while. The author has been supporting them, which is good, but it's taking a toll. The friend asked for Airpods as a birthday gift, and the author couldn't afford it. The friend then got angry, passive-aggressive, and even sent pictures of self-harm and suicidal comments. The author called them selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. The friend's depression is a serious issue. Using self-harm and suicide as leverage is manipulative and wrong, but it's also a sign of their mental state. The author tried to set a boundary by being honest about their financial situation. However, responding with \"selfish and manipulative\" might have been harsh, especially given the friend's mental health. The author was in a stressful situation, but the friend's behavior escalated things. The key here is whether the author's response was appropriate. While the friend's actions were manipulative, the author might not be wrong for setting a boundary. However, calling someone selfish in the context of their mental health could be seen as insensitive. The balance here is tricky. The friend's behavior was definitely problematic, but the author's response might have been a valid reaction to manipulation. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but it's close. The friend's mental health is a factor, but the author isn't the one using suicide as a threat. The author's main mistake was calling them selfish, which could add to the friend's feelings of being unappreciated. However, the friend's actions were more egregious. So, maybe the answer is A (author is wrong) because they didn't handle it with more empathy. Wait, but the author was honest about their situation. Maybe the problem is that they used the term \"selfish\" without addressing the underlying mental health issue. So, the author could have handled it better, but is that being in the wrong? The friend's manipulation is worse. Hmm. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong), because the friend's actions were more egregious. The author was honest and tried to set a boundary, while the friend used manipulation and self-harm threats.\n"
