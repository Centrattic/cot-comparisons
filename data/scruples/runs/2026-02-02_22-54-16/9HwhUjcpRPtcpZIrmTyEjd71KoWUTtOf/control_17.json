I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the friend has been depressed for a while, and the author has been trying to support them even though it's taking a mental toll. The friend asked for Airpods as a birthday present, but the author can't afford it and said no. The friend then got angry, passive-aggressive, mentioned past gifts (which were cheaper), and showed self-harm. The author called them selfish and manipulative, leading to an ignoring.\n\nFirst, the author's situation: they're low on money and trying to be honest. They apologized and couldn't say yes. The friend's reaction was intense, including self-harm and suicide mentions. The author called them out for being manipulative, which might be harsh given the friend's mental state.\n\nBut wait, the friend's behavior is concerning. They have a history of depression and now self-harm. The author is trying to support but is also in a difficult position financially. The friend's passive-aggressive comments about past gifts might be guilt-tripping, which the author is right to point out. However, when someone is in crisis, responding with labels like \"selfish\" might not be helpful. Even if the friend is manipulative, the immediate reaction should be concern for their safety.\n\nThe author's main mistake might be calling the friend selfish instead of addressing the underlying issue of their depression and self-harm. The friend's threats of suicide are serious and should trigger a supportive response, not a judgmental one. Also, even if the friend is manipulative, the author's responsibility is to prioritize the friend's well-being over gifts. However, the author did express that they were honest about their financial situation. \n\nBut the key here is the friend's self-harm and suicide comments. The author's response of calling them selfish could be seen as not taking the situation seriously. Even if the friend is acting out, the author should have offered support instead of criticism. The friend might be in a very fragile state, and the author's reaction might have exacerbated the problem. So, the author is in the wrong because they responded with judgment during a crisis instead of offering support.\n"
