I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who's been depressed for a while and the author, who's been supporting them. The friend wanted Airpods for their birthday, but the author couldn't afford them. The friend got angry, passive-aggressive, and even mentioned suicide. The author called them selfish and manipulative, leading to being ignored.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is in a tough spot financially and emotionally. They've been supporting their friend, which is commendable. When the friend expressed wanting an expensive gift they can't afford, the author's refusal seems reasonable. However, the friend's reaction\u2014using passive-aggressive comments and suicidal threats\u2014could be a cry for help, especially given their history of depression.\n\nNow, the key point is whether the author's response was appropriate. The author called the friend selfish and manipulative. That might be valid if the friend was using emotional manipulation, but given the friend's mental health struggles, the author might have been too harsh. They might have needed to take a different approach, like showing empathy or discussing the friend's feelings instead of calling them out directly when they're in a vulnerable state.\n\nBut here's the thing: the author was under financial stress and had been supporting the friend for a long time. Their mental health was also affected by this. The friend's behavior escalated the situation, using guilt-tripping and even mentioning suicide. In that context, the author's frustration might be understandable, though the way they expressed it could have been better.\n\nThe challenge is balancing the friend's mental health with the author's own limits. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries, but maybe the timing or method wasn't the best. However, the friend's actions were clearly manipulative and harmful, which justifies the author's reaction to some extent.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might not be the asshole here. The friend's behavior was problematic, and the author had the right to express their limits. However, the author could have handled it more compassionately, but not to the point of being in the wrong. The friend's manipulation and escalation are on them. Therefore, the answer is B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
