I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who is depressed and got suicidal over not getting Airpods as a birthday gift. The author called their friend selfish after the friend made threats.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend has been depressed, the author has been supporting them, but they're low on money. The friend wanted expensive Airpods, the author couldn't afford it. The friend got upset, passive-aggressive, mentioned previous gifts (which were cheaper), and then sent pictures of self-harm and suicidal comments. The author responded by calling them selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for calling their friend selfish. On one hand, the friend's behavior is concerning\u2014self-harm and suicidal comments are serious. On the other hand, the author is stressed and low on money, trying to manage their own resources while supporting a friend.\n\nBut wait, when someone is in crisis, especially with self-harm and suicide threats, the appropriate response is to prioritize their safety. The author's reaction of calling them selfish might come across as dismissive or invalidating. Even if the friend is manipulating, the immediate concern should be to de-escalate and offer support, not accuse them of being selfish. The author might not have handled the situation well by not taking the threats seriously enough, or at least not knowing how to respond effectively under stress.\n\nAlso, considering the friend's mental health history, the author's stress is valid, but the way they reacted could have worsened the friend's feelings. The key here is that when someone is in a vulnerable state, even if they're acting out, the priority is to address their well-being, not to assign blame. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of not being able to afford the gift, but the response to the friend's crisis could be seen as inappropriate.\n\nSo, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because of how they responded to the friend's crisis. They should have perhaps focused on getting help for their friend instead of labeling them as selfish. Even if the friend was manipulative, the author's reaction wasn't supportive during a critical moment.\n"
