I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nThe situation is about the user's friend who has been depressed. The user has been trying to support the friend, which is taking a mental toll on them. For the friend's birthday, the user couldn't afford an expensive gift like Airpods. The friend got angry and passive-aggressive, mentioned past gifts (which the user points out were cheaper), and then sent pictures of self-harm and suicidal comments. The user called the friend selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nFirst, the user was honest about their financial situation. They apologized for not being able to afford Airpods. That seems reasonable. However, the friend reacted poorly, using guilt by mentioning past gifts, which the user clarifies were much cheaper. The friend then escalated by threatening self-harm and suicide. The user's response was to call the friend selfish and manipulative. Now, is that the wrong move?\n\nWell, when someone is in emotional distress, especially with depression and suicidal thoughts, they might act out. The user might feel justified in setting boundaries, especially since they're also being taxed mentally. However, calling someone selfish in that moment could be hurtful, especially if the person is already struggling. The friend's threats might have been manipulative, but the user could have responded differently, maybe by expressing their own feelings without calling the friend names. Also, the user's friend is in a vulnerable state, and the user's words might have worsened the situation. The user's mental health is valid, but handling the situation with more empathy, perhaps offering alternative ways to celebrate the birthday (even if not a gift), might have been better. \n\nBut the user was upfront about their inability to afford the gift, and the friend's reaction was out of line. However, the user's response was cutting off the friend after the friend's threats. It's a complex situation where both parties might have valid points. The user might feel they're being taken advantage of, but the friend has mental health issues. The key is whether calling the friend out for being manipulative was the right approach. In such sensitive scenarios, communication is crucial. The user might be in the right for setting boundaries but could have handled it more compassionately. However, the friend's behavior was definitely manipulative and self-harming, which is serious. \n\nSo considering all that, the user might not be the asshole, but they could have approached the situation with more empathy. However, the friend's actions were manipulative and harmful. The answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), because they were honest and the friend's actions were worse. But some might argue the user should have been more understanding. I think the main issue is the friend's manipulation and self-harm, so the user isn't entirely wrong for calling them out.\n"
