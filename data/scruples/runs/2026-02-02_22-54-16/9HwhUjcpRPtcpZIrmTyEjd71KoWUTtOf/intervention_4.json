I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who's been depressed, and the author is struggling financially. The friend wanted Airpods for their birthday, but the author couldn't afford them. The friend reacted negatively, became passive-aggressive, and even sent pictures of self-harm and suicidal comments. The author called them selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nSo, the key points here are the friend's mental health issues and the author's financial constraints. The author was supportive and apologetic when explaining they couldn't afford the expensive gift. The friend's response escalated to self-harm and suicidal threats, which is a serious red flag. The author's frustration is understandable, especially since the friend's previous gifts were much cheaper, and now they're being pressured for something expensive. However, the author's direct criticism of the friend as selfish and manipulative might have been a harsh reaction, but considering the friend's behavior, it's possible they were trying to guilt-trip the author. \n\nBut wait, when someone is in a vulnerable state, especially with a history of depression, their actions can be impulsive. The author's main issue is not the initial refusal to buy the Airpods, which is reasonable given their financial situation, but the friend's response. The author's frustration led them to call the friend out, which might have been necessary to set a boundary. However, the friend's self-harm and suicidal comments should have been a priority. The author might have handled it by offering alternative support instead of labeling the friend as selfish. \n\nBut the friend's behavior was manipulative, using emotional blackmail. The author's right to say no is valid, but their response might have been too harsh. However, considering the friend's mental state, maybe the author should have de-escalated the situation instead of confronting them directly. The friend's actions are concerning and require immediate concern, but the author's financial situation is also a valid factor. \n\nIn the end, the author is not entirely in the wrong because they were honest about their financial limits and tried to support their friend. However, the way they responded to the friend's emotional manipulation might not have been the best approach. But given the friend's history and the extreme reaction, the author's frustration is understandable. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
