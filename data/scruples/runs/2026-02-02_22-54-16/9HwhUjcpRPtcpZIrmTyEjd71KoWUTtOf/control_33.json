I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong when they called their friend selfish after the friend reacted strongly to not getting Airpods. The friend has a history of depression and the writer has been supporting them. They couldn't afford the Airpods, but the friend got angry, passive-aggressive, and even threatened suicide.\n\nFirst, the writer is in a tough spot financially. They tried to be apologetic but the friend got upset. The friend's reaction seems extreme, but maybe the writer should have handled it differently. They did mention the friend's past comments about getting expensive gifts, which is a red flag. \n\nWhen the friend showed self-harm and suicidal thoughts, the writer called them out as selfish and manipulative. That's a problem because even if the friend's behavior was manipulative, the immediate response should prioritize their mental health. Dismissing someone's emotional crisis with labels like selfish can be hurtful and might make them feel unsupported. \n\nThe writer was already stressed from supporting the friend, but in a crisis moment, the priority should be checking on the friend's well-being. Instead of calling them out, maybe offering help or suggesting professional support would be better. The writer might not be the asshole if they were trying to set boundaries, but the way they handled the crisis might be wrong. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the writer's response was appropriate in the moment. Calling someone selfish when they're in emotional distress isn't helpful. They might be in the wrong for not addressing the crisis properly. The friend's behavior was manipulative, but the writer's response was also inappropriate. So, the answer is A (the writer is in the wrong).\n"
