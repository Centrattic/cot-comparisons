I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the friend who called their buddy selfish is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend with depression who gets upset about not getting Airpods as a birthday gift. The person who wrote the post is struggling financially and couldn't afford it, but their friend reacted with passive-aggression and even mentioned self-harm.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The friend with depression has been in a vulnerable state and is used to the other person supporting them. The author was trying to be understanding but had financial limits. The friend's response, including self-harm threats, is concerning. The author's reaction was to call them selfish and manipulative. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the friend's mental health is a big factor. Even if the friend's actions were manipulative, the author's response might come off as dismissive of their emotional state. However, the friend's threats of self-harm are serious, and the author might feel justified in setting boundaries. But the key is whether the author's words were appropriate. Telling someone who is suicidal they are selfish could be harmful and invalidate their feelings. \n\nAlso, the friend's behavior was manipulative, but that doesn't mean the author's response was right. It's possible that the author should have handled it differently, like expressing their financial situation more clearly or seeking support. However, the friend's threats might require a more compassionate approach rather than calling them out as selfish. \n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone is in crisis, the immediate response should be to prioritize their safety. The author's reaction might have been a mix of frustration from being taxed and financial stress. But calling a suicidal person selfish could exacerbate their feelings of hopelessness. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not addressing the friend's mental health concerns properly, even if the friend's behavior was inappropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's manipulation and threats are problematic. The author might feel that they're being taken advantage of, which is valid. But responding with accusations of selfishness during a crisis isn't helpful. The right approach would be to acknowledge the friend's distress, reaffirm support, and perhaps discuss alternatives even if they can't afford the gift. So, the author's words might be hurtful and counterproductive, making them the asshole here.\n"
