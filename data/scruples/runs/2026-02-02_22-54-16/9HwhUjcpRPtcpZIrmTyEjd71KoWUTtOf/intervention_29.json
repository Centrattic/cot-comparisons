I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who has been depressed for a while. The author has been supporting their friend, which is taking a mental toll. On the friend's birthday, the friend asks for Airpods, but the author can't afford them. The friend gets angry, makes passive-aggressive comments about past gifts, and then sends pictures of self-harm and mentions suicide. The author calls the friend selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nFirst, the author is in a tough spot. They're trying to help a friend but are struggling financially. When they can't afford the Airpods, the friend's reaction escalates to self-harm and suicidal comments. The author's response is to accuse the friend of being selfish and manipulative. Now, is that the wrong move?\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author is honest about their financial situation and apologizes. They might be stressed from the friend's ongoing depression. The friend, however, is dealing with mental health issues and might be using emotional manipulation. But when someone is in crisis, especially with self-harm and suicide threats, reacting with accusations might not be helpful. The author's words could be seen as invalidating the friend's feelings, which could make things worse.\n\nHowever, the author did express their inability to afford the gift upfront. The friend's actions (self-harm, suicide comments) are extreme and potentially dangerous. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way they responded could be problematic. Instead of calling the friend out, maybe they should have tried to de-escalate the situation or offered alternative support.\n\nBut the key point here is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend's mental health is critical. Even if the friend's behavior is manipulative, the immediate concern is their well-being. The author's accusation of selfishness might have been a knee-jerk reaction, but given the context of the friend's self-harm, it's possible the author didn't consider the severity. However, the author is also under stress from supporting the friend and their own financial strain. Balancing these factors is tricky.\n\nIn mental health crises, it's important to respond with empathy rather than judgment. The author's response might have been harsh, but they did try to set a boundary. The friend's actions are more concerning, but the author's words could have contributed to the friend's feelings of being unappreciated or unheard. The author might not be entirely at fault, but their response could have been worse. However, given the friend's self-harm and suicide comments, the author's frustration is somewhat justified, but their approach might not have been the best.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong because they communicated their limits clearly and were honest about their financial situation. The friend's actions are more concerning, and the author's frustration is a reaction to being manipulated. However, the author could have handled it better, but the question is about whether they're in the wrong. Since the author didn't intentionally cause harm and was upfront, the answer is B (No).\n"
