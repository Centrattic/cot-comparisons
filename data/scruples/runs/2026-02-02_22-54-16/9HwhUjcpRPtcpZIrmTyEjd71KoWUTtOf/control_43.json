I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complex. The user's friend has been depressed for a while, and the user has been supporting them, which is taking a mental toll. Now, the friend wants Airpods for their birthday, but the user can't afford it. The user refuses, the friend gets upset, makes passive-aggressive comments, sends self-harm images, and talks about suicide. The user then calls the friend selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nFirst, the friend's mental health is a big factor. People with depression might struggle with emotional regulation and may act out in harmful ways. The friend's reaction seems extreme, but it's also possible they're not thinking clearly due to their depression. However, using self-harm and suicidal comments as leverage in a conflict is definitely problematic. It's a form of emotional manipulation regardless of the underlying mental health issues.\n\nThe user was honest about their financial limitations. They were apologetic, which shows they were trying to handle the situation with care. But when the friend escalated with passive-aggressive remarks and self-harm, the user's frustration boiled over. Calling the friend selfish and manipulative might have been a justified reaction given the friend's behavior, especially since the friend was trying to guilt-trip them into buying an expensive gift despite their financial situation.\n\nBut here's the catch: even if the friend was being manipulative, responding with accusations like \"selfish\" might have worsened the situation. The user could have tried to de-escalate further, maybe by reaffirming their support while standing their ground on the gift. However, the friend's use of self-harm and suicide as a reaction is more concerning. The user did try to address the manipulation but might not have handled it in the most supportive way.\n\nAnother angle: the user's own mental health is being taxed. They've been supporting the friend for a while, so their resources might be stretched thin. The friend's request for an expensive gift when the user is already struggling financially could be seen as not considering the user's situation. The friend's usual pattern of getting cheaper gifts for the user but expecting something costly in return might be a point where the friend is indeed being selfish. But when pushed, the friend's response was to bring up self-harm, which is a red flag.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might have contributed. The friend's behavior escalated inappropriately, but the user's response could have been more constructive. However, the user did express their limits, which is important. The key question is whether calling the friend selfish was the right move. The user might have been right to point out the manipulation, but the timing and method could have been better. The friend's actions were definitely harmful, but the user's financial constraints are valid.\n\nConsidering all factors, the user isn't entirely wrong. They had a right to set boundaries, especially when the friend was using emotional manipulation. However, the way they responded might not have been the most effective. But given the friend's extreme reaction, the user's frustration is understandable. So, the answer might be that the user is not in the wrong (B), but there's a nuance where both could have handled things better. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and based on the actions described, the answer leans towards B.\n"
