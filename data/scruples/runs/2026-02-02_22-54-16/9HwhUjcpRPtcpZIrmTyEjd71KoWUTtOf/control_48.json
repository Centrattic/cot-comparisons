I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's been dealing with depression and the author's reaction when the friend wanted Airpods for his birthday.\n\nFirst, the friend has a history of depression, and the author has been supportive, which is good. But when the friend asks for Airpods, the author says they can't afford it. The friend gets angry and makes passive-aggressive comments, then sends pictures of self-harm and suicidal thoughts. The author then calls the friend selfish and manipulative, leading to an argument.\n\nNow, the key points here are depression and self-harm. The friend's actions\u2014bringing up self-harm and suicide\u2014are serious. When someone is in that state, their behavior might be manipulative or self-centered, but that doesn't make it right. However, the author's response was to label the friend as selfish and manipulative. That could be hurtful, especially when the friend is already struggling. Even if the friend's approach was wrong, calling them those terms might escalate the situation and could be seen as invalidating their feelings.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author was being honest about their financial situation and set a boundary. However, the friend's response involved self-harm and suicide, which are red flags. The author's reaction might be harsh, but they were trying to maintain their own mental health by not giving in to manipulation. Still, the way they expressed disapproval by calling the friend selfish might not be the best approach in a crisis. It's possible the author needs to handle the situation with more empathy, even if the friend's actions were inappropriate.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be the asshole, but they could have handled it better. The friend's actions are concerning, but the author's response might be a bit harsh. However, the friend's use of self-harm and guilt-tripping is definitely problematic. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance here. The author is in a tough spot between their own stress and the friend's mental health issues. The line between standing up for oneself and being supportive is thin here. The author's words were direct, but given the context, maybe they're justified. So the answer is B.\n"
