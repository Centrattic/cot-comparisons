I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend who is depressed and has a history of getting expensive gifts from the author. The friend wanted Airpods for his birthday, which the author couldn't afford. The friend then reacted with passive-aggressive comments, sent pictures of self-harm, and mentioned suicidal thoughts. The author called him selfish and manipulative, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the mental health aspect. The friend is dealing with depression and has a history of self-harm. When someone is in that state and mentions suicide, it's a serious red flag. The author's immediate reaction was to label the friend as selfish and manipulative. That might come across as dismissive of the friend's emotional state.\n\nEven though the author is struggling financially and the friend's demands seem excessive, the way the author responded could have been more empathetic. Calling someone selfish in a moment of crisis might seem harsh. The friend's behavior, while problematic, is influenced by his depression. The author might not have handled the situation optimally by not addressing the underlying issues first.\n\nHowever, the author was also in a position where they couldn't afford the gift and had been supporting the friend emotionally for a long time. They tried to be apologetic but faced an aggressive response. The friend's actions escalated the situation, but the author's response might not have been the most supportive.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have some accountability. The friend shouldn't use self-harm or threats to manipulate, and the author could have handled the situation with more compassion. However, in the context of the question, whether the author is in the wrong, the key point is the immediate reaction. Labeling someone as selfish in a crisis might not be the best approach, even if the friend is being manipulative. The author could have acknowledged the friend's feelings first before addressing the financial issue.\n\nSo, considering the mental health aspect and the potential impact of the author's words, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A), but there's nuance here. However, based on the typical \"Am I the Asshole\" dynamics, the community often looks at the immediate action. The author's words could have been hurtful, so maybe A is the right choice. But I'm a bit conflicted. Let me check again.\n\nThe friend threatened suicide and showed self-harm, which is a serious crisis. The author's response was to call them selfish, which might not address the crisis but instead accuse. In such cases, the appropriate response would be to prioritize the friend's safety, maybe by encouraging them to seek help, rather than lecturing them. So the author's action might be seen as inconsiderate of the friend's mental state, making the author the asshole. Therefore, answer A.\n"
