I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who is already dealing with depression. The author, who's struggling financially, can't afford Airpods as a birthday gift. The friend reacts negatively, becomes passive-aggressive, and then mentions self-harm. The author calls the friend selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nFirst, the friend's mental health is a significant factor. People with depression might have intense emotional reactions, and self-harm is a serious red flag. The author tried to be supportive, but the friend's behavior escalated to the point of mentioning suicide. \n\nThe author did respond by calling the friend out for being selfish, which might not be the best approach when someone is in crisis. Guilt-tripping and passive-aggressive behavior from the friend is manipulative, but when someone is suicidal, the priority is their safety. The author should have de-escalated the situation, maybe expressed understanding and offered support instead of labeling the friend. \n\nHowever, the author was honest about their financial limitations, which is reasonable. But in the heat of the moment, the response was harsh. It's possible the author was frustrated from the ongoing mental health burden, but reacting with \"selfish and manipulative\" could make the friend feel more isolated. \n\nSo, considering the context, the author might be in the wrong for not addressing the friend's suicidal comments appropriately and instead escalating the conflict. The correct approach would be to prioritize the friend's safety, seek help if needed, and communicate empathy rather than criticism. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
