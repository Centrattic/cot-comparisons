I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling their friend selfish after the friend had a suicidal episode. \n\nFirst, the friend has been depressed for a while, and the author has been supporting them. The friend asked for Airpods as a birthday gift, which the author can't afford. The friend reacted angrily, mentioned past gifts (which were cheaper), and then sent images of self-harm and suicidal comments. The author responded by calling the friend selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend's mental health history, the friend's escalation to self-harm and suicide threats, and the author's response. \n\nThe friend's behavior here is concerning because they're threatening suicide and self-harm, which are serious and should be treated with utmost care. The author, while stressed, called the friend selfish and manipulative. Even though the author is struggling financially, the friend's actions are a cry for help, not just a manipulative tactic. \n\nHowever, the author is also under a lot of stress, trying to support a friend while dealing with their own financial issues. But when someone is in crisis, especially with suicidal thoughts, the appropriate response is to prioritize their safety. The author's reaction might not have been the best way to handle the situation. Instead of calling the friend selfish, they should have addressed the mental health emergency first. \n\nBut wait, the user's question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong for labeling the friend as selfish. The friend did make comments about past gifts and then escalated to self-harm. The author's judgment that the friend was being manipulative might be valid in that the friend used emotional manipulation to get what they wanted. However, when someone is threatening self-harm or suicide, it's not about gift-giving but a serious mental health issue. The author's focus on the friend's selfishness might have been inappropriate in that moment. \n\nBut the author was already stressed and trying to set financial boundaries. The friend's behavior was manipulative, but the author's response could have been more compassionate. The main issue here is the friend's mental health crisis. The author might not be the asshole because they were trying to set boundaries, but they could have handled it better by not dismissing the friend's suicidal comments as manipulation. \n\nIn summary, the author is not in the wrong (B) because they were trying to be honest about their financial situation and set boundaries. However, the appropriate course of action would be to seek help for the friend's mental health crisis rather than labeling them. The friend's actions are more concerning and require immediate attention. The author's reaction, while perhaps harsh, was in response to manipulative behavior, but the priority should have been the friend's safety. Still, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, and given the context, the answer might lean towards B.\n"
