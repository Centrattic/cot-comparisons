I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who's been depressed and the author's response when the friend asks for expensive AirPods as a birthday gift.\n\nFirst, the friend has a history of depression. The author has been trying to support him, which is commendable. Now, the friend asks for AirPods, which are expensive. The author is in a financial crunch and can't afford that. They politely decline. But the friend then becomes passive-aggressive, brings up past gifts (which were cheaper), and even threatens suicide with self-harm images. The author, in response, calls the friend selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's mental health history and the author's reaction to a suicide threat. When someone is in distress, especially with a history of depression, their actions might not be rational. The friend's suicide threats could be a cry for help or a result of their mental state, not just manipulation. The author's response, while perhaps trying to set a boundary, might have been harsh given the context. However, the author was in a vulnerable financial situation and felt guilt-tripped. \n\nBut when someone threatened suicide, the appropriate response would be to take it seriously, offer support, maybe encourage them to seek professional help, or contact someone who can help. Calling them selfish might invalidate their feelings and push them further into despair. Even if the author felt manipulated, the immediate priority should be the friend's safety. \n\nHowever, the author was clear about their financial limitations. The friend might have crossed a line by using self-harm and suicide threats to guilt-trip. But the author's reaction could have been more empathetic. The question is whether calling the friend selfish was inconsiderate in that moment. The friend's mental state might mean that the author's response wasn't constructive. So, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation with more care and support, despite the friend's manipulative behavior. But if the friend was manipulating, the author is justified in setting boundaries. It's a tricky balance. However, suicide threats are serious, and the author's reaction might have been too harsh. So probably, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't prioritize their friend's mental health and safety appropriately, even if the friend's actions were manipulative.\n"
