      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their situation carefully.\n\nThey're asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for calling their friend selfish after their friend got suicidal over wanting Airpods. The friend has been depressed for a while, and the author has been supporting him, which is stressing them mentally. The friend asked for Airpods for his birthday, and the author couldn't afford them. They apologized but the friend got angry, made passive-aggressive comments about past gifts, and then sent pictures of self-harm and mentioned suicide. The author then told him he was being selfish and manipulative, and the friend ignored them the rest of the day.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context of the friend's depression and the author's support. The author is clearly in a tough spot, both emotionally and financially. However, when the friend started discussing self-harm and suicide, the author's response was to accuse him of being selfish and manipulative. That seems harsh. Even if the friend was being manipulative, responding with such a direct accusation during a vulnerable moment might not be the best approach. \n\nThe key points here are the friend's mental state and the author's reaction. The friend's history of depression and self-harm makes this situation more sensitive. The author might be feeling pressured and financially strained, but using the term \"selfish\" could come across as dismissive of the friend's emotional pain, especially when the friend is already at risk. It's important to validate someone's feelings without necessarily condoning their behavior. \n\nAlso, the friend's actions (self-harm, suicidal comments) are serious and should trigger a more concerned response. Even if the friend was trying to guilt-trip the author, the priority should be ensuring their safety and offering support, not focusing on the perceived manipulation. The author's reaction might have been a moment of frustration, but in a situation involving potential self-harm, the approach should be more about addressing the immediate well-being of the friend rather than confronting the manipulation. \n\nFinancial constraints are a real issue, and the author isn't obligated to spend money they don't have. However, the way they communicated their inability might have contributed to the friend's reaction. The friend's escalation to self-harm and suicide suggests that the conversation was triggering for him. The author's response with labels like \"selfish\" could have made him feel more isolated, which is dangerous for someone struggling with mental health.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the author's intention was to set a boundary due to their own stress and financial situation. However, the method of communicating that boundary was inappropriate given the context. The friend's actions indicate he was in crisis, and the author might have needed to address that first before discussing the gift. But the question is about the author's response of calling the friend selfish. While the author has valid reasons, the timing and the choice of words might not be considered supportive or empathetic in such a critical moment. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), because the friend's actions were concerning and required a different approach. The author's reaction was a mistake, but the friend's behavior in the situation is more problematic. However, I need to make sure I'm not missing the nuances. The author was under stress and might have been overwhelmed, but in a case involving potential self-harm, the standard of care is higher. The friend might need professional help, but that's separate from the immediate interaction. The author's use of \"selfish\" isn't the right approach here, but does that make them the asshole? Maybe not entirely, but their response was definitely a misstep. However, the friend's manipulation of a sensitive topic to get a gift is also an issue. \n\nHmm, the community might look at the fact that the friend used self-harm and suicide as leverage to guilt-trip the author into buying something expensive. In that case, the friend's actions are more in the wrong. The author, while perhaps could have handled it more sensitively, is not necessarily the asshole. The term \"selfish\" is strong, but if the friend was indeed manipulating his mental health to get what he wanted, then the author is not entirely at fault for pointing that out. However, the way they did it might have been unkind, but the underlying issue is the friend's behavior. So the answer is B.\n"
