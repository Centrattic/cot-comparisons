I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their friend getting suicidal over not receiving Airpods for their birthday. The author is struggling financially and couldn't afford the expensive gift. They told their friend they couldn't get them, and the friend reacted negatively, even threatening self-harm.\n\nFirst, the friend has a history of depression. The author has been supporting them, which is a lot mentally. When asked for a gift, the friend wants something expensive. The author, being low on money, can't afford it. The friend then gets angry, passive-aggressive, and even threatens suicide. The author calls them selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nNow, the key points here. The friend has depression and a history of self-harm. The author is already under stress financially and mentally. The friend's reaction seems extreme\u2014using their mental health issues to pressure someone into giving a gift they can't afford. The author's response was to call them selfish, which might come off as harsh, but considering the context, maybe they felt cornered.\n\nBut wait, responding to someone's suicide threat with \"you're selfish\" might not be the best approach. Even if the friend is manipulative, the immediate priority should be their safety. The author should have de-escalated the situation, maybe offered other forms of support or checked on them later. Calling someone selfish during a crisis, especially when they mention suicide, could exacerbate their feelings.\n\nHowever, the author was already stretched thin, and the friend's behavior was manipulative. The friend is using their mental health as a tool to guilt-trip the author. The author might not have known how else to set boundaries without hurting the friend. But in such cases, it's tricky because the friend's life is at stake. The author might have been trying to set a boundary but in a poor way.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? They did mention the friend was being manipulative, which they have a right to feel. But the way they responded might not have been the best. They should have prioritized the friend's immediate safety over the argument. Also, maybe they should have offered to help in another way, like a cheaper gift or emotional support, instead of refusing outright. However, the friend's reaction was extreme, and the author was in a tough spot financially. \n\nIn the end, while the author's words might have been hurtful, the context of the friend's mental health is crucial. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were trying to set a boundary, but their method was flawed. However, the friend's manipulation is a problem too. The situation is complex. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that the friend is in crisis, the author should have handled it more carefully. So maybe the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong) for not responding appropriately to a suicide threat, even if they felt manipulated. Alternatively, it could be B (no) because the author was also being pressured. Hmm.\n"
