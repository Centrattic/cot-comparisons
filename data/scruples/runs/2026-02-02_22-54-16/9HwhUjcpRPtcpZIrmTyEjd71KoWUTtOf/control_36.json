I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who has been depressed, and the author is struggling financially. The friend wanted Airpods for his birthday, but the author couldn't afford them. The friend got angry, passive-aggressive, and even sent pictures of self-harm and suicidal comments. The author called him selfish and manipulative, leading to a day of being ignored.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is clearly in a tough spot financially and has been supporting a friend with depression. It's understandable that they feel stretched thin. However, the friend's reaction seems extreme\u2014using self-harm and suicidal threats to pressure for a gift. That's concerning and possibly manipulative.\n\nThe author's response was to call the friend selfish and manipulative, which might come off as harsh, especially given the friend's mental health issues. But the friend's behavior was also using emotional manipulation and self-harm to get what they want, which isn't healthy. The author might be right in pointing out the manipulation, but the way they did it could have been more empathetic.\n\nHowever, the key point here is that the friend's actions involved self-harm and suicidal comments. Even if the friend was being manipulative, the author's response of calling them selfish might not address the underlying issues. It's possible the author should have been more concerned about the friend's immediate well-being rather than focusing on being called out for not buying the gift.\n\nBut the author also mentions that the friend had been asking for expensive things while the author usually got cheaper gifts. So there's a history of imbalance. The friend's behavior might be a pattern of manipulation. However, using self-harm and suicidal threats is a red flag. The author might be right in pointing out the manipulation, but they should have handled it more carefully, maybe by expressing concern for the friend's mental health instead of accusing them.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author is not in the wrong for setting a boundary and explaining their financial situation. However, the friend's reaction was extreme and potentially harmful. The author could have handled the situation better by showing more empathy and addressing the friend's mental health concerns rather than labeling them as selfish. But the friend's use of self-harm to manipulate is definitely problematic. So maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in their approach.\n"
