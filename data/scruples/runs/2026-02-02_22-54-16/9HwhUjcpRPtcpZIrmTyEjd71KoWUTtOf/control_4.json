I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend wanting Airpods for his birthday, and the author can't afford them. The friend got upset, mentioned self-harm and suicidal thoughts, and the author called him selfish and manipulative. Then the friend ignored them.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The friend has been depressed, and the author has been supporting them. But when it comes to a gift, they couldn't afford the expensive item. The friend then reacted with anger, passive-aggressiveness, brought up self-harm, and made suicide comments. The author's response was to call them selfish and manipulative, which led to the friend ignoring them.\n\nNow, considering mental health issues. The friend's history of depression and current suicidal thoughts are crucial here. When someone is in a vulnerable state like that, their actions might be a cry for help. The friend might be using emotional manipulation, but the author's response might not be the best. However, the friend's behavior is concerning because they're threatening self-harm. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot financially and was trying to be honest. But when the friend brought up self-harm, the appropriate response would be to de-escalate, offer support, maybe suggest other ways to celebrate the birthday. Calling them selfish and manipulative could be seen as dismissive, especially when someone is in crisis. That might have made the situation worse. However, the friend's actions were also manipulative, using self-harm to guilt-trip the author.\n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend's actions are problematic, but the author's response might not be the best. However, the author was upfront about their financial situation. The friend's reaction is more about their mental health crisis than the Airpods. The author might not be wrong because they were honest, but they could have handled it better. Alternatively, by calling the friend selfish, they might be invalidating their feelings, which is not helpful when someone is in crisis.\n\nIn many cases, when someone threatens self-harm, the priority is ensuring their safety. The author's response might not be the right approach, but the friend's behavior is more concerning. However, the author's comment about being selfish could be seen as insensitive. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't prioritize the friend's mental health crisis over the argument about the gift. Or maybe not, because they were honest and the friend's actions were manipulative. It's a bit of a tricky balance.\n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B), because they were honest about their financial situation and the friend's actions were manipulative. However, the way they handled the friend's crisis might not be ideal. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the friend's behavior was more manipulative, maybe the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
