I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend with depression who gets suicidal over not receiving Airpods for his birthday.\n\nFirst, the friend has been depressed for a while, and the author has been supporting him, which has been mentally taxing. The friend asked for Airpods, but the author couldn't afford them and said no. The friend then got angry, passive-aggressive, showed self-harm images, and mentioned suicide. The author called him selfish and manipulative, leading to being ignored.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the friend's mental health and the author's response. The friend's reaction\u2014passive-aggression, threatening self-harm, and mentioning suicide\u2014is severe. Those are red flags for someone in crisis, which the author might not have recognized properly.\n\nBut the author's response was to call the friend selfish and manipulative. That's a strong accusation, especially when the friend is expressing suicidal thoughts. Even if the author is under financial stress, the way they responded might not be supportive. It's important to acknowledge that while the friend's behavior was harmful, the author's reaction could be seen as dismissive of the friend's mental health. \n\nHowever, the friend's actions of threatening self-harm are not okay. The author should have addressed the concern about the friend's well-being first, maybe saying they can't get the Airpods but are worried about the friend's comments. Insulting the friend in that moment might have made things worse. \n\nThe friend might be using their mental health to manipulate, but the author's job is to support them, not to judge their intentions. The author's response could be seen as invalidating the friend's feelings. Even if the friend is being manipulative, the author shouldn't have called them selfish at that moment. They should have focused on the suicide threat first, then discussed the gift. \n\nSo, the author's approach was flawed. They didn't prioritize the friend's immediate crisis. But the friend's behavior was also problematic. In terms of being the asshole, the author's harsh words might have been the trigger for the friend ignoring them. However, the friend's threats are serious and shouldn't be taken lightly, but the author's response was inappropriate given the context. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they dismissed the friend's crisis with an accusation of selfishness instead of offering support. Even if the friend was manipulative, the author's reaction wasn't helpful and could have worsened the situation.\n"
