I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling their friend selfish after a conflict about a birthday gift. The situation involves depression, financial strain, and emotional manipulation.\n\nFirst, the friend has been depressed for a while. The author has been supporting them, which is taxing. The friend asked for expensive Airpods, and the author couldn't afford them. The friend then became passive-aggressive, mentioning past gifts and implying guilt. The author called them selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them and showing self-harm.\n\nNow, the key points here: The friend has a history of depression and possibly mental health issues. They might be using emotional manipulation as a result of their mental state. The author is in a difficult financial situation, which is valid. However, when the friend brought up self-harm, the author's response was to call them selfish, which could be seen as invalidating the friend's emotional state.\n\nEven though the author is stressed, responding with accusations of selfishness during a crisis might not be the best approach. The friend's threats of self-harm are a red flag that requires immediate concern, not a confrontation about gift-giving. The author might not have handled the situation well by not addressing the friend's mental health crisis first, instead of focusing on the perceived manipulation.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author is also under stress and in a low financial position. The friend's behavior could be manipulative, using self-harm as leverage. However, the author's response might have exacerbated the situation. The right approach would be to prioritize the friend's well-being, even if it's manipulative. Calling someone selfish during such a critical moment could be hurtful and unhelpful.\n\nSo, considering the friend's mental health, the author might have overstepped by labeling them as selfish, especially after self-harm was mentioned. It's possible that the author is in the wrong because they didn't address the immediate crisis and instead focused on the manipulation, which could be seen as dismissive of the friend's real issues.\n"
