I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling their friend selfish after a conflict over a birthday gift.\n\nFirst, the friend has been depressed for a while. The author has been supporting them, which is taxing. The friend asked for Airpods, but the author can't afford it. The friend gets angry, passive-aggressive, mentions past gifts (which were cheaper), and then shows self-harm and suicidal threats. The author calls the friend selfish and manipulative, leading to a day-long silence.\n\nNow, considering the elements here. The friend has a history of depression and self-harm. Their mental health is a key factor. When someone is in a vulnerable state, using emotional manipulation or self-harm as leverage can be a red flag. However, the author's response was to accuse the friend of being selfish and manipulative. \n\nBut wait, the friend's actions (self-harm and suicidal comments) are serious. The author's reaction might have been a response to manipulation attempts. However, dismissing someone's mental health struggles by calling them selfish could be hurtful. Even if the friend's behavior was manipulative, the author's approach might not be the healthiest. They could have addressed the situation differently, maybe by reaffirming support while explaining their financial constraints without labeling the friend.\n\nAlso, the author was already under stress from supporting the friend, which might have contributed to their reaction. But in such sensitive situations, the way to handle it is crucial. Calling someone selfish in the context of mental health issues can be damaging. The right approach would be to express their own limitations clearly while encouraging the friend to seek professional help. \n\nSo, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were honest about their inability to afford the gift and stood their ground against manipulation. However, their wording and approach could have been more compassionate. The key is whether the accusation of selfishness was justified given the circumstances. Since the friend's mental health is a factor, the author's response might be seen as dismissive. \n\nBut the friend's behavior\u2014using self-harm and suicide threats as a way to get what they want\u2014is concerning and manipulative. The author was within their rights to set boundaries and express frustration. However, the way they expressed it could have been more empathetic. \n\nIn conclusion, the situation is complex. The author isn't entirely wrong for setting a boundary, but their response could have been more supportive. The friend's actions are problematic, but the author's response might have been harsh. However, considering the friend's manipulation and the author's need to set boundaries, the answer might lean towards the author not being the asshole. But the accusation of selfishness might be a bit harsh given the friend's mental health. It's a tricky call. Maybe the correct answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author was honest and the friend's behavior was manipulative, but the author's approach could improve.\n"
