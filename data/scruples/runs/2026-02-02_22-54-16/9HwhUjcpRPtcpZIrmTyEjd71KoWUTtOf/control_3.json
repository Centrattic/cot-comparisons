I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who's been depressed, and the author had to say they can't afford Airpods for his birthday. The friend then reacted with passive-aggressive comments and even sent pictures of self-harm, leading the author to call him selfish and manipulative. The friend ignored them after.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is in a tough spot financially and has been trying to support their friend mentally, which is taking a toll. They made their position clear about not being able to afford the Airpods, which is a reasonable thing to say. However, the friend's reaction involved self-harm and suicidal threats, which are serious. The author's response was to label the friend as selfish and manipulative, which might be harsh given the friend's mental state.\n\nBut wait, is the author in the wrong for calling them out? The friend used emotional manipulation by bringing up self-harm. The author is trying to set a boundary, which is okay. However, the way they expressed it might have been hurtful. Even if the friend's actions were manipulative, the author could have handled it more compassionately. The key point is whether the author's reaction was appropriate given the friend's mental health issues.\n\nOn one hand, the author isn't responsible for the friend's self-harm, but calling them selfish right after they mentioned suicide might not be helpful. It could make the friend feel misunderstood. On the other hand, the author has the right to set financial limits and isn't obligated to buy expensive gifts. The friend's behavior was inappropriate, but the author's response might have been too harsh. Maybe the author should have acknowledged the friend's feelings without giving in to the demands. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether prioritizing one's own mental health and financial situation is valid. The author tried to support the friend, but the friend's manipulation crossed a line. However, the author's direct criticism might have worsened the situation. The correct answer might be that the friend is wrong for using manipulative tactics, but the author's response could be seen as harsh. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. Considering the context, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they had a right to be honest about their financial limits and call out the manipulation, even if it came off as harsh. But maybe the answer is A because they could have handled it better. Hmm, I'm a bit torn. The friend definitely overstepped, but the author's reaction might not be the best approach. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. I think the answer is B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
