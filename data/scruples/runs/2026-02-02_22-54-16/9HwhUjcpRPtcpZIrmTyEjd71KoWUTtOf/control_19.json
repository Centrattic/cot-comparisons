I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who posted the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who's been depressed, and the author had to say they can't buy expensive Airpods for his birthday. The friend then acts out by cutting himself and mentioning suicide, and the author calls him selfish and manipulative. The friend ignores him after that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the mental health aspect here. The friend has been depressed for a while, and the author has been trying to support him. When the friend can't get the Airpods, he reacts with passive-aggressive behavior, shows self-harm, and threatens suicide. That's pretty serious. But the author, already stressed from supporting his friend, responds by calling him selfish. \n\nNow, when someone is in a vulnerable state, especially with depression and suicidal thoughts, their actions might not be entirely rational. The friend's reaction could be a result of his mental state, possibly pushing the author to give in. However, the author is also under pressure, financially strained, and might have felt manipulated. \n\nIs it wrong to call someone selfish in that situation? Well, even if the friend was acting out of depression, accusing him of being selfish might have been hurtful. The author could have handled it differently, like expressing their financial constraints again and offering another way to show support. Instead of labeling the friend as selfish, maybe a more empathetic approach would have been better.\n\nBut the friend's actions\u2014self-harm and suicide threats\u2014are severe. The author might have felt backed into a corner, especially if they were already giving a lot to support the friend. However, responding with an accusation of selfishness might have worsened the situation. The key here is how to balance personal boundaries with supporting someone's mental health.\n\nIn situations involving mental health crises, it's important to prioritize the well-being of the person in crisis. The author's response might have been a result of stress and frustration, but pointing out the friend's selfishness could have been a misstep. The friend's behavior is concerning, but the author's reaction might not be the best approach. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong for their response. They could have handled the situation more compassionately instead of labeling the friend. However, the friend's actions are also problematic. But the question is whether the author is the asshole. The answer likely leans towards A (Yes) because the author's response was dismissive and didn't address the friend's urgent mental health needs, even if their own stress is a factor.\n"
