I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The situation is about whether the person who wrote the question (AITA) is in the wrong after telling their friend they were selfish when the friend got suicidal over not receiving Airpods.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The friend has been depressed for a while, and the author has been supporting them. The friend asked for expensive Airpods as a birthday gift, but the author couldn't afford it. The friend reacted poorly, making passive-aggressive comments and showed self-harm images, even threatening suicide. The author then called them selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nNow, the key points here. The friend has a history of depression and self-harming, which is a serious mental health issue. The author tried to be supportive but is also in a financial hardship. The friend's demands for an expensive gift might have been unreasonable, but their reaction escalated the situation with self-harm and suicidal comments.\n\nCalling someone selfish when they're in a vulnerable mental state could be seen as harsh, especially if their actions are a cry for help. However, the author was being honest about their financial constraints. But the friend's response is extreme and potentially dangerous. The author's frustration is understandable, but responding with \"selfish and manipulative\" during such a crisis might not be the best approach. It might be seen as invalidating the friend's emotional state, even if the friend's behavior was manipulative.\n\nBut consider the context: the friend is suicidal. The author might have been overwhelmed and snapped, but addressing mental health issues requires care. Maybe the author should have expressed their feelings without labeling the friend, or sought to de-escalate the situation instead of calling them names. However, the friend's manipulation through self-harm and suicide threats is problematic. The author's reaction is a response to that manipulation, which could be seen as justified if the friend was indeed being manipulative, but it's a delicate balance.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the friend's actions are concerning, but the author's words might have contributed to the friend ignoring them. However, the friend's behavior was extreme. It's possible the author is not in the wrong because they were trying to set a boundary, but maybe they could have handled it more compassionately. However, given the friend's mental state, the author's response could be seen as unkind, making them partially at fault. It's a tough call. Maybe the answer is A because the author's words could be hurtful in that context, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, B if the friend's manipulation is to blame. I think the answer is A because even if the friend was being manipulative, calling someone selfish in the heat of the moment, especially when they're in a crisis, might be unhelpful and hurtful. So the author is in the wrong.\n"
