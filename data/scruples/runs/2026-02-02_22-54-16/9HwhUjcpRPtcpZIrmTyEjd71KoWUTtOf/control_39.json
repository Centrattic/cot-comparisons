I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a friend who's been depressed, and the author is trying to support him even though it's taking a toll on them. The friend asks for Airpods for his birthday, but the author can't afford it. The friend gets angry, passive-aggressive, sends pictures of self-harm, and threatens suicide. The author calls him selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nFirst, the author is in a tough spot financially and communicates their inability to buy an expensive gift. They apologize and explain their situation. But the friend reacts strongly, bringing up past gifts which were cheap, and then escalates with self-harm and suicide comments. The author, feeling manipulated, calls him out. \n\nNow, the key points here are: 1) The friend has a history of depression and self-harm. 2) The author is genuinely struggling financially and communicated that clearly. 3) The friend's reaction included emotional manipulation and self-harm threats. 4) The author called him out for being manipulative, which might have been a mistake.\n\nIn such situations, when someone is dealing with mental health issues, their reactions can be intense. Even if the author is in a bad financial situation, the friend's behavior involves self-harm and suicide threats, which are serious. The author's response of labeling the friend as selfish might have been a knee-jerk reaction. However, the author also had the right to set boundaries, especially when they're already stretched thin. \n\nBut when someone is in crisis, even if they're being manipulative, the appropriate response is usually to de-escalate and seek help. Calling them out as selfish could be seen as invalidating their feelings, which might be harmful, especially if they're already vulnerable. The author might not have handled it well, but the friend's actions were concerning. \n\nSo the question is, is the author at fault for standing up for themselves, or should they have handled it differently? The friend's actions are manipulative and potentially dangerous, but the author's response might have been harsh. However, the author did try to be apologetic and set limits. The friend's escalation is on them, but the author's words might have been unkind. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they were honest about their financial situation and tried to support their friend, but the way they responded to the manipulation could have been better. However, since the question is whether they are in the wrong, the answer might be B (No), because the author did communicate their limits and the friend's actions were problematic. But I'm a bit conflicted because calling someone selfish when they're in crisis isn't ideal. Still, the author's main fault is not the act of setting a boundary but perhaps the harshness of the response. However, the friend's behavior is also a significant factor. So maybe the author is not in the wrong, but their approach could have been more empathetic. But the answer options are A or B. Considering the context, B seems more likely.\n"
