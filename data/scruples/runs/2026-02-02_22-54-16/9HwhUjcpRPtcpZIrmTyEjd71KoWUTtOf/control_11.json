I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called their friend selfish is in the wrong. The situation involves the friend being depressed, the author trying to support them, but then a conflict arises over a birthday gift.\n\nFirst, the friend has been struggling with depression, and the author has been trying their best to support them. That's important because it shows the author is invested in the friendship. However, the author is also dealing with their own financial constraints, which is valid. When the friend asks for expensive Airpods, the author can't afford it and says so politely. The friend then gets angry and starts making passive-aggressive comments about past gifts, which were much cheaper. The friend then sends pictures of self-harm and mentions suicidal thoughts. The author responds by calling them selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nNow, considering mental health issues like depression and suicidal tendencies, the situation becomes more complex. The friend's reaction might be influenced by their mental state, and their manipulation could be a result of that. However, the author is also in a difficult position, financially strained and trying to maintain their own mental health while supporting a friend. \n\nBut when someone is in crisis, especially with suicidal thoughts, their actions might not be entirely their fault. They might be acting out of desperation and emotional pain. The friend's manipulation (bringing up self-harm) is a serious red flag, and the author's response of calling them selfish could be seen as not taking the friend's mental health seriously enough. However, the author was also honest about their inability to afford the gift, which is fair.\n\nBut here's the catch: when someone is in a vulnerable state, their manipulative behavior, while not excused, is part of their illness. The friend might not be fully responsible for their actions during a mental health crisis. The author's response of calling them selfish might have been a reaction to the manipulation, but it's possible the author could have handled it differently, like reaffirming support while standing their ground on the gift. \n\nHowever, the friend's actions\u2014using self-harm and suicidal remarks as leverage\u2014are definitely manipulative. The author has a right to set boundaries, especially financially. But the line between manipulation and genuine crisis is thin. The author might not be in the wrong entirely because they were honest and tried to support their friend, but they might have handled it poorly. Alternatively, the friend's actions are a result of their mental state, which complicates fault.\n\nIn many cases like this, the person in crisis isn't considered to be in the right, but the person responding might also have valid points. The key is whether the author's response was appropriate. Calling someone selfish in the context of their mental health crisis could be hurtful. Maybe a better approach would have been to express concern, reaffirm support, but not give in to the manipulation. However, the author did express that they were trying to support the friend, so they might not be in the wrong. \n\nBut ultimately, the friend's manipulative tactics are problematic, and the author's frustration is understandable. The answer might hinge on whether the author's response was justified given the manipulation. However, in a community like Reddit's \"Am I the Asshole,\" the community often looks at the person being manipulative as the one at fault, but if the responder is equally inconsiderate, it's a mutual issue. In this case, the friend's actions are more harmful, so maybe the author isn't the asshole. But calling someone selfish when they're in a mental health crisis could be seen as not empathetic enough. \n\nHmm. It's a tough call. The author has valid reasons (financial constraints, honesty), but their response was harsh. The friend's behavior is manipulative and harmful. The community might split, but typically, if someone uses self-harm as manipulation, they're often seen as the asshole. However, if the person is genuinely in crisis, they're not considered at fault. In this case, the friend is described as having been depressed for a while, so the self-harm might be a result of that. The author might not be in the wrong for setting boundaries, but their response could be seen as dismissive. However, the friend's use of self-harm as a tactic is more serious. So the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, if the author's response was unkind, maybe A. But given the context, perhaps the author is not the asshole because they were honest and the friend was manipulative. So B.\n"
