I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The situation involves their friend getting suicidal over not receiving Airpods as a birthday gift. The author, who's been supporting their friend through depression, couldn't afford the expensive gift and told them so. The friend then got angry, passive-aggressive, and even sent pictures of self-harm. The author called the friend selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been depressed for a while, and the author has been trying to support them, which is taxing on them. When asked for a birthday gift, the author honestly says they can't afford Airpods. The friend reacts with anger and makes passive-aggressive remarks about past gifts, which were much cheaper. Then, the friend shows self-harm and mentions suicide, which is a serious red flag. The author responds by calling the friend selfish and manipulative, then the friend ignores them.\n\nNow, the key points here are: 1) The friend's mental health history; 2) The author's financial constraints; 3) The friend's reaction involving self-harm and suicide threats; 4) The author's response and the fallout.\n\nThe author is in a tough spot. They tried to be honest about their financial situation, which is a valid reason. However, when the friend escalated to self-harm and suicide, the appropriate response would be to express concern and offer support, not to label the friend as selfish. Even if the friend's behavior was manipulative, the mention of self-harm and suicide requires immediate attention and empathy. The author's reaction might have worsened the situation by causing the friend to shut down.\n\nBut does that make the author the asshole? They were already stressed from supporting their friend. However, when someone is in crisis, especially with suicidal thoughts, the priority is to de-escalate and seek help. Calling them selfish could be seen as dismissive. The friend's actions are concerning, but the author's response might have been inappropriate given the circumstances. The author should have focused on addressing the friend's mental health crisis rather than confronting them about being manipulative.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's behavior was definitely problematic. Using self-harm and suicide as leverage to get what they want is manipulative. But the author's handling of the situation might not have been the best. They should have acknowledged the friend's feelings and suggested alternatives, maybe involving professional help. Instead, they criticized the friend, which could have pushed them further into isolation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They did have a right to be honest about their financial limits. However, their response to the friend's crisis was not supportive. The appropriate action would be to express concern for the friend's well-being, not to accuse them of being selfish. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because their response was dismissive during a critical moment when support was needed.\n"
