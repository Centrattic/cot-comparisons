I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after calling their friend selfish when the friend got suicidal over airpods. The situation is a bit complex because it involves mental health issues and financial constraints.\n\nFirst, the friend has been depressed for a while. The author has been trying to support them, which is mentally taxing. That's important because it shows the author is already under stress from trying to help. When the friend asks for expensive airpods, the author can't afford them and says no. The friend gets angry and passive-aggressive, then threatens suicide. The author calls them selfish and manipulative, leading to silence.\n\nNow, the key points here. The friend's depression and suicidal comments are serious. The author's response was to label them as selfish and manipulative. While the author is in a tough spot financially and emotionally, responding with such a strong accusation might not be the best approach. Even if the friend's behavior was manipulative, calling them selfish in the heat of the moment, especially when they've threatened self-harm, could be seen as insensitive. \n\nBut the author was already under a lot of pressure, trying to support a friend. They might have felt cornered, especially if the friend was using guilt-trips. The author's apology for not being able to afford the gift might have been sincere, but the friend escalated the situation. However, the author's response might not have adequately addressed the friend's mental health crisis. Instead of labeling the friend, maybe they should have de-escalated the situation or suggested alternative ways to celebrate the birthday that fit their budget. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's behavior was extreme. Threatening suicide could be a cry for help, and the author might not be equipped to handle that. The author's frustration is understandable given their own stress. But in a mental health crisis, even if someone is manipulative, it's important to prioritize their well-being over being right. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. They expressed their feelings of being manipulated, which is valid, but their response might have been harsh. However, considering the context of their own stress and the friend's history, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. The friend's actions were definitely problematic, but the author could have handled it more compassionately. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but with the caveat that their response could have been more supportive. The friend's actions were more extreme, so the primary responsibility isn't on the author. Still, there's room for improvement in how they addressed the situation.\n"
