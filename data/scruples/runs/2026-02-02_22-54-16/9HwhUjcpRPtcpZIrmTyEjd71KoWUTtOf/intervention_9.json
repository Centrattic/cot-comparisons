I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for calling their friend selfish after the friend got suicidal over AirPods. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has been depressed for a while, and the author has been supporting them. When the friend asked for AirPods for their birthday, the author couldn't afford them and said so, apologizing. The friend became passive-aggressive, bringing up past gifts (which were much cheaper), and then sent pictures of self-harm and suicidal comments. The author then called them selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's mental health history and the author's response. The author is in a tough spot because they can't afford the expensive gift, but the friend's reaction involves self-harm and suicide threats. The author's words might seem harsh, but they might be reacting to the friend's manipulation.\n\nI should consider the ethical implications. The author apologized and tried to be honest about their financial situation. However, when the friend escalated to self-harm and suicidal ideation, the author's response of calling them selfish could be seen as dismissive. Even if the author was stressed, the friend is in a vulnerable state. The right approach might be to acknowledge the friend's feelings without validating the harmful behavior. \n\nBut the author might feel overwhelmed and possibly making a joke or not taking the friend's actions seriously. However, using the word \"selfish\" in such a context could be damaging. The friend's actions are a cry for help, and the author's response might not have been supportive enough. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend is manipulating by bringing up self-harm. The author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the manipulation, but the way they did it (calling the friend selfish and manipulative) might have been unhelpful. The author should have responded with concern for the friend's mental state rather than focusing on the perceived manipulation. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author's words were a proportionate response. The friend's behavior is manipulative and harmful, but the author should prioritize the friend's well-being. Saying \"selfish\" might not be the right approach. Maybe the author is in the wrong for not handling the situation with more care, even if the friend is being manipulative. \n\nAlternatively, the author is not in the wrong because they were honest and the friend's behavior was inappropriate. But given the context of a friend in crisis, the author's response could be seen as contributing to the problem. \n\nI think the correct answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because even if the friend was manipulative, the author should have prioritized expressing concern and perhaps offered help in another way instead of labeling them as selfish.\n"
