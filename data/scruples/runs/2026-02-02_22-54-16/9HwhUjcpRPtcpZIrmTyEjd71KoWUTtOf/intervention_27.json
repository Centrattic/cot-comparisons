I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong after calling their friend selfish when the friend got suicidal over airpods.\n\nFirst, the friend has been depressed for a while. The author has been trying to support them, which is mentally taxing. When the friend asks for Airpods for their birthday, the author can't afford it and says no. The friend gets angry, passive-aggressive, mentions previous gifts (which were cheaper), and then starts sending pictures of self-harm and suicidal comments. The author responds by calling them selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nSo, the key points here: the friend has a history of depression and self-harm. The author is in a financial situation that makes them unable to buy expensive gifts. The friend's reaction escalates to threats of self-harm, which the author addresses by calling them out for being manipulative. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. On one hand, the author is honest about their financial situation and sets boundaries. They express support but can't meet the friend's request due to their own constraints. However, the friend's behavior includes self-harm and suicide threats, which are serious. The author's response of labeling the friend as selfish and manipulative might be seen as dismissive of the friend's emotional state, even if the author is under stress.\n\nBut the author did apologize for not being able to afford the gift and was apologetic. The friend's reaction seems to be a manipulation tactic to guilt-trip the author into giving a more expensive gift. The author's frustration is understandable given they've been supporting the friend for a long time. However, when faced with the friend's self-harm and suicide comments, the author's response might not be the most supportive. Even if the friend is manipulative, the author's comment of calling them selfish could come across as invalidating their emotional pain.\n\nBut the friend was already in a manipulative state, and the author was trying to set a boundary. The author isn't responsible for the friend's mental health, but their response might not have been the most empathetic in the moment. However, the friend's behavior was extreme and potentially harmful. It's a tough call. The author might not be in the wrong because they did express support and tried to explain their situation, but they might not have handled the friend's threats appropriately. Instead of calling the friend selfish, maybe they should have de-escalated the situation or suggested other ways to celebrate the birthday without the gift.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author was honest about their financial situation and tried to set boundaries, but it's a close call. The friend's actions were more manipulative, and the author's frustration is valid.\n"
