I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who is depressed and got suicidal over not getting Airpods for his birthday. The author called him selfish and manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend has been struggling with depression for a while, and the author has been trying to support him. The friend asked for Airpods, but the author couldn't afford them. The friend then became angry, passive-aggressive, mentioned their previous gift-giving (where the friend usually gave more expensive items), and even sent cuts and suicidal comments. The author responded by calling him selfish and manipulative.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the friend's mental health and the author's response. The friend's reaction escalated after being told they couldn't get the Airpods. The author was honest about their financial situation but the friend used emotional manipulation, including suicidal threats. The author then called them out for being selfish and manipulative.\n\nNow, considering the friend's history of depression and the immediate reaction, maybe the author's call-out was too harsh? But on the other hand, using suicidal comments to guilt someone into buying an expensive gift is indeed manipulative. However, the author might not have known if the friend was genuinely in crisis or just acting out.\n\nBut the friend's actions\u2014sending pictures of self-harm and suicidal comments\u2014are serious. The author's response was to call them out, which might have been a way to set a boundary, but it could have been done more compassionately. However, the author was already stressed from supporting the friend, and their mental health might be affected too.\n\nIn similar situations, people often debate whether calling someone out for manipulative behavior is justified, especially when there's a history of mental health issues. The line between being honest and being insensitive can be thin. The friend's manipulation is problematic, but the author's direct response might have been the wrong way to handle it emotionally.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend's actions were manipulative and self-harming, but the author's response could have been unkind. However, the author was clear about their inability to afford the gift and was apologetic. When the friend escalated with passive-aggression and threats, calling them out might be a way to stop the manipulation. However, the term \"selfish and manipulative\" might have been harsh, especially if the friend is struggling with mental health.\n\nBut the friend's behavior was definitely crossing boundaries. The author had a right to express their limits. However, the way it was said might not have been helpful. The friend's response of ignoring them could indicate that the author's words hurt, even if they were true.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often look at who's at fault. The friend's manipulation is bad, but the author's response might not be the worst. The author was honest and set a boundary, which is important. However, in the heat of the moment, using such strong language when someone is in crisis might not be the best approach. The author could have acknowledged the friend's feelings while standing their ground.\n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but there's room for both perspectives. However, the friend's manipulative behavior was definitely problematic, and the author had a right to express their limits. The key is whether the author's response was appropriate. Using \"selfish and manipulative\" might have been harsh, but the friend's actions were indeed manipulative. The author's mental health is also a factor here, as they were already taxed from supporting the friend.\n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being the asshole, but there's nuance. The friend's actions were worse, but the author could have handled it more sensitively. Ultimately, the friend's manipulation is more harmful, so the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary. So the answer would be B.\n"
