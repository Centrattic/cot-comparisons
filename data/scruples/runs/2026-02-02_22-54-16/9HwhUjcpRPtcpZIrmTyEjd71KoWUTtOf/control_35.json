I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who's been depressed, and the author called him selfish after he reacted strongly to not getting Airpods.\n\nFirst, the friend has a history of depression. The author has been trying to support him, which is good, but now it's taking a toll on the author mentally. The friend asked for an expensive gift (Airpods) for his birthday. The author can't afford it and said so, but the friend became angry, passive-aggressive, and even mentioned self-harm and suicidal thoughts. The author then called him selfish and manipulative, and the friend ignored them.\n\nNow, the key points here. The friend has a history of depression and mental health issues. When someone is in a vulnerable state, their actions might stem from their mental state rather than malice. The author tried to be supportive, but the friend's reaction seems to be a cry for help or a manifestation of their depression. The author's response was to label the friend as selfish, which might not be the right approach. Even if the friend's behavior was manipulative, the author could have handled it differently, maybe by reaffirming support while explaining their own limits.\n\nHowever, the author is also dealing with their own mental health from the stress of supporting a friend. It's a tough situation. But when someone is suicidal, the immediate response should be to take them seriously and encourage professional help, not to assign blame. Calling someone selfish in that moment could push them further into despair. The friend's behavior, while hurtful, might be a sign they need more help than the author can provide right now.\n\nSo, the author's intention wasn't to be cruel, but the timing and words might have been unhelpful. Even if the friend's actions were manipulative, the author should have addressed the underlying issue rather than just labeling them. The friend might be in a crisis that requires more than just emotional support; they might need to talk to a mental health professional.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author is in a difficult position, the way they handled the friend's crisis might not have been the best. Calling the friend selfish could be seen as invalidating their feelings during a vulnerable time. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong here.\n"
