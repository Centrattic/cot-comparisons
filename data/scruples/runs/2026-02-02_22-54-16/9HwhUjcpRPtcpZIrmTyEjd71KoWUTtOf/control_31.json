I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a friend who's been depressed, and the author is supporting them. The friend wanted Airpods for their birthday, but the author can't afford it. The friend then gets angry, passive-aggressive, and even mentions self-harm and suicide. The author calls them selfish and manipulative, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, the friend has a history of depression. The author has been trying to support them, which is commendable. But when it comes to the Airpods, the author is in a tough financial spot. The friend's reaction seems extreme\u2014getting angry over not getting an expensive gift they can't afford. The friend also brings up past gifts, which were much cheaper. The author is honest about their inability to afford the Airpods and apologizes.\n\nBut then the friend starts sending pictures of self-harm and mentions suicide. That's a serious red flag. The author responds by calling them selfish and manipulative. Is that appropriate?\n\nWell, when someone is in crisis, especially with suicidal thoughts, the immediate priority should be their safety. The author's response, while maybe justified in feeling manipulated, might have been too harsh in the moment. Calling someone selfish when they're in a vulnerable state could make them feel more isolated, which is dangerous. The author might have been trying to set a boundary, but the timing and method could have been better.\n\nHowever, the friend's behavior does seem manipulative. Using threats of self-harm to get what they want is a form of manipulation. The author is in a tough spot here\u2014trying to balance their own financial limits with supporting a friend's mental health.\n\nBut the key point is that the friend made suicide threats. The author's response might not have been the most supportive way to handle it. Instead of immediately labeling them as selfish, maybe they should have asked if the friend is okay, or suggested getting help. The author's mental health is also a factor\u2014they\u2019re being taxed by supporting a friend. But in a crisis situation, the immediate concern is the friend's safety.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't prioritize their friend's immediate crisis. Even if the friend is manipulative, the right response would be to address the suicidal comments first. The author's reaction could have contributed to the friend feeling ignored, which is dangerous. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
