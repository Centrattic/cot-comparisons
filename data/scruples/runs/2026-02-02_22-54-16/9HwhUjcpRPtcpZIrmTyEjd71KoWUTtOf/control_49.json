I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend, who's been depressed, wants Airpods for his birthday. The author can't afford them and says no. The friend then acts passive-aggressive, mentions previous gifts (which were cheaper), and shows self-harm. The author calls the friend selfish and manipulative, leading to silence.\n\nFirst, the friend has a history of depression and has been struggling. The author has been supporting them, which is good. But the friend is in a vulnerable state. When the author can't afford the expensive gift, the friend feels rejected and might be trying to manipulate by bringing up self-harm. That's a serious issue.\n\nThe author's response was to call the friend selfish and manipulative. While it's valid to set boundaries, especially when under financial stress, using those terms might come off as harsh, especially with someone who's mentally unwell. Instead of addressing the underlying issue (friend's depression, need for support), the author labels the friend's behavior, which might not help. Also, the friend's self-harm is a red flag that needs immediate concern, not just a response about being manipulative. The author should probably have focused on expressing willingness to support in other ways, not just financially, and maybe checked in on their friend's well-being beyond the gift issue. So the author's approach might have been too direct and not empathetic enough given the context. Hence, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
