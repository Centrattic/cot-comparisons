I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend being upset over not getting Airpods as a birthday gift, leading to the author calling the friend selfish after the friend made threats about suicide.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has a history of depression, and the author has been supporting them, which is taking a toll. The friend asked for an expensive gift (Airpods) when the author is broke, and the friend reacted angrily, even with passive-aggressive comments and self-harm images. The author then called the friend selfish and manipulative.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's think about the key points. The friend's mental health is a significant factor here. When someone is struggling with depression, their actions and reactions might not be entirely rational. The friend's response (self-harm and suicidal comments) is a red flag, indicating they might be in crisis. The author's immediate reaction to call them selfish could be seen as dismissive of their emotional state. \n\nHowever, the author is in a difficult position too. They were honest about their financial situation and apologized. The friend's demand for an expensive gift might be unreasonable, especially if it's beyond the author's means. The author might have felt pressured by the guilt-tripping, which the friend did by referencing past gifts. \n\nBut the friend's response of threatening suicide is a serious issue. Even if the initial request was unreasonable, the author's response of calling them selfish could exacerbate the situation. In such cases, it's important to prioritize the friend's safety. The author might have handled the conversation poorly by focusing on the selfishness rather than addressing the friend's emotional distress and offering support.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's own mental health is also a factor. They mentioned that supporting their friend is taxing them. It's valid to set boundaries, but the way it was communicated might have been the problem. The author could have expressed their inability to afford the gift without invalidating the friend's feelings, especially when the friend was in a vulnerable state.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the friend's actions are concerning, but the author's response might have added to the friend's distress. The key issue is whether the author's reaction was appropriate given the friend's mental health crisis. Even if the friend was manipulative, the author's words might have been hurtful and could have worsened the situation. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the conversation with more empathy during a crisis.\n"
