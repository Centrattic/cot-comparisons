I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend with depression who gets upset over not receiving Airpods as a birthday gift, leading to a conflict where the author calls the friend selfish and manipulative.\n\nFirst, the friend has a history of depression, which is a significant factor. The author mentions supporting their friend, which is commendable, but they're also under financial strain. The friend's reaction seems extreme\u2014threatening self-harm and expressing suicidal thoughts. The author's response was to call them selfish, which might be a valid reaction to manipulation but could also come off as insensitive given the friend's mental health issues.\n\nI need to consider the context of mental health. Even though the friend's demands were unreasonable, the author's friend is struggling with depression. The author's support is being tested here. However, calling someone selfish when they're in a vulnerable state might not be the best approach. The friend's behavior could be a cry for help, not just manipulation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was honest about their financial limits, which is responsible. They apologized and tried to set boundaries. The friend's response of passive-aggressive behavior and self-harm threats is problematic. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way they addressed it by labeling the friend as selfish might have been hurtful, even if justified.\n\nThe key points are the friend's mental health, the author's financial situation, and the friend's manipulative tactics. The author isn't entirely wrong for setting boundaries, but the way they handled it could be seen as dismissive. However, given the friend's history and the situation, the author's reaction might be a reasonable frustration. It's a tough balance between empathy and self-care. I think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong, but there's nuance here. The friend's mental health is a critical aspect to consider, but the initial question is about the author's wrongdoing. Since the author tried to support their friend and set clear boundaries, they might not be the asshole here. So, the answer is B.\n"
