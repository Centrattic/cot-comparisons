I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their friend getting suicidal over not receiving Airpods for a birthday, and the author called the friend selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend has been depressed for a while, and the author has been supporting them, which is taking a mental toll. The friend asked for Airpods, which the author can't afford. The friend reacted angrily, bringing up past gifts and making passive-aggressive comments. Then the friend sent pictures of self-harm and mentioned suicide. The author responded by saying the friend was selfish and manipulative, leading to being ignored.\n\nThe main question is whether the author's response was appropriate. On one hand, the friend's behavior is concerning\u2014self-harm and suicidal comments are serious. On the other hand, the author is in a difficult financial situation and has been trying to support the friend. \n\nBut calling someone selfish when they're in a vulnerable state might not be the best approach. Even if the friend's behavior is manipulative, the author could have handled it more compassionately. The friend's mental health is a significant factor here. Instead of labeling them as selfish, maybe the author should have expressed their financial constraints more clearly and offered alternative support. \n\nAlso, the friend's actions\u2014bringing up self-harm and suicide\u2014might be a cry for help rather than genuine manipulation. The author's response might have been a reaction to being guilt-tripped, but using the word \"selfish\" could have hurt the friend further. The author might not be in the wrong entirely because they were honest about their inability to afford the gift, but the way they responded could have been more considerate. \n\nHowever, the friend's behavior is problematic too. Using suicide as a manipulative tactic is wrong, but the author's response might have escalated the situation. The key here is whether the author's words were harmful given the friend's mental state. \n\nIn mental health contexts, it's important to approach such situations with empathy. Even if the friend is acting out, the author should have found a way to set boundaries without dismissing the friend's emotional state. The author's mental health is also a factor, as supporting a friend can be taxing. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, I think the author is partially at fault for calling the friend selfish in that moment. They might have needed to address the situation more carefully to avoid hurting the friend further, even if the friend's behavior was manipulative. But it's a complex situation where both parties have valid points. However, the label \"selfish\" might have been the wrong choice given the friend's mental state. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong, but I'm a bit conflicted because the friend's actions were also inappropriate.\n"
