I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's friend had depression and got upset over not receiving Airpods for his birthday. The author couldn't afford it and told the friend, who then became passive-aggressive and even mentioned self-harm and suicide. The author called the friend selfish, and now they're wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been struggling with depression for a while, and the author has been trying to support him, which is taking a toll mentally. When the friend asked for Airpods, the author couldn't afford it and said so, but the friend reacted strongly. The friend sent pictures of self-harm and mentioned suicide, which is a serious issue.\n\nThe author's response was to call the friend selfish and manipulative. Now, the key points here are the friend's mental health and the author's reaction. \n\nOn one hand, the friend's behavior\u2014using threats of self-harm and suicide to guilt-trip someone into buying an expensive gift\u2014is problematic. That's manipulation, definitely. The friend might be in a vulnerable state, but that doesn't justify the manipulation. On the other hand, the author is in a difficult position, financially strained and supporting a friend with mental health issues, which is exhausting. The author tried to be apologetic but was met with hostility. \n\nBut the author's response was to label the friend as selfish and manipulative. Even if the friend is being manipulative, in a situation where someone has a history of depression and self-harm, the author might have a responsibility to handle the situation more carefully. Calling the friend selfish could be seen as dismissive of their mental state. The author might not be \"wrong\" in the sense that the friend's behavior is bad, but the way they responded might not be the best approach. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not whether they could have handled it better. \n\nThe friend's actions are clearly manipulative and inappropriate, especially bringing up self-harm and suicide as leverage. The author's reaction is a direct response to that manipulation. So, in terms of who's in the wrong, the friend's actions are more egregious. The author's comment, while perhaps harsh, is a reaction to the friend's behavior. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not the author's fault), because the friend's manipulation and self-harm threats are more to blame. The author is responding to the friend's actions and is under financial stress themselves. However, there's a caveat that the author could improve their approach, but the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best possible response.\n"
