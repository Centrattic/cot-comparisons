I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend getting upset over not receiving Airpods as a birthday gift, leading to suicidal comments. The author called the friend selfish, which led to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend is described as having been depressed for a while. The author has been trying to support them, which is taking a mental toll. The friend asked for Airpods, which the author can't afford. The friend then reacts angrily, uses passive-aggressive comments, and even shows self-harm and suicidal thoughts. The author responds by calling them selfish and manipulative.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's mental health issues. Even though the friend might be acting out due to depression, it's important to consider if the author's response was appropriate. Calling someone selfish when they're in crisis might not be the best approach. The friend's reaction\u2014threatening suicide\u2014could be a sign of deeper issues needing help rather than just a tantrum.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a difficult financial situation and tried to be apologetic. They felt guilt-tripped into buying an expensive gift when usually they asked for cheap items. The friend's actions (self-harm, suicidal comments) are extreme, but the author's response could have been more empathetic. Instead of labeling the friend as selfish, maybe offering support or discussing the situation differently could have been better.\n\nHowever, the friend's behavior is concerning. Using self-harm and suicide threats as a manipulation tactic is manipulative, but it's often a result of their mental health struggles. The author might not realize the severity of the friend's depression. Still, responding with \"you're selfish\" in that moment might escalate the situation instead of providing support.\n\nSo, the author could have handled it better. Even if the friend is being manipulative, the author's response might have been hurtful. But the friend's actions are also problematic. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for calling them selfish. Given that the friend was in crisis, the author might not be entirely wrong, but they could have approached it more compassionately. However, the friend's behavior is more concerning. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in their response. So leaning towards B (not in the wrong) but with some nuance.\n"
