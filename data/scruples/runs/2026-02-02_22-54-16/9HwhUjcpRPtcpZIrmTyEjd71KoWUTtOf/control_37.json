I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a friend who has been depressed. The author has been trying to support them, which is taking a toll mentally. Then, the friend asks for Airpods for their birthday, but the author can't afford it. The friend gets upset, passive-aggressive, and even threatens suicide. The author calls them selfish and manipulative, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, the friend has a history of depression, which is a serious mental health issue. The author has been supportive, which is commendable. However, when the friend asked for an expensive gift they couldn't afford, the author said no. The friend then reacted with anger, passive-aggression, and even showed self-harm. That's a red flag. The author felt pressured and called the friend selfish, which might have been a reaction to the friend's manipulative behavior.\n\nBut wait, when someone is depressed, their emotions can be more volatile. The friend's reaction to not getting the Airpods might be tied to deeper issues. Maybe they feel unappreciated or are using the situation to express their pain. The author's response of calling them selfish could have come off as dismissive of their emotional state. Even if the friend's behavior was manipulative, the author should consider the mental health aspect here.\n\nAlso, the friend's history of depression means that threatening suicide is a serious warning sign. The author's response might have been a knee-jerk reaction without considering the underlying issues. Even though the author is right to set boundaries, the way they expressed it might not have been the best. Instead of calling the friend selfish, maybe they should have acknowledged the friend's feelings while still standing their ground about not being able to afford the gift.\n\nIn mental health situations, communication is key. The author might have needed to express their financial limitations more clearly and perhaps offer an alternative way to support the friend, rather than making them feel guilty. The friend's behavior is concerning, but the author's response could have been more empathetic. So, considering all that, the author might be partly at fault for not handling the situation with more care and understanding, even if the friend's actions were manipulative.\n"
