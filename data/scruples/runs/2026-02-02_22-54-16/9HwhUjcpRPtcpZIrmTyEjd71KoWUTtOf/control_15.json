I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who has been depressed and the writer's reaction when the friend got upset over not receiving Airpods for his birthday.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend has been dealing with depression, and the writer has been supportive, which is taking a toll on them mentally. The friend asked for Airpods, but the writer couldn't afford them. The friend then became passive-aggressive, brought up past gifts, and even sent images of self-harm and suicidal comments. The writer called the friend selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The friend's behavior includes self-harm and suicidal threats, which are serious mental health issues. The writer is in a financially tight spot and tried to communicate that they can't afford the gift. However, the friend's response escalated the situation by using emotional manipulation and threatening self-harm. \n\nThe writer's reaction was to call the friend out for being selfish and manipulative. While it's important to acknowledge the friend's mental health struggles, the writer might have been overwhelmed and not handling the situation well. However, labeling someone as selfish in the context of their depression and self-harm could be seen as dismissive of their emotional state. It's possible the writer didn't realize the severity of the friend's condition or didn't know how to respond appropriately.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's approach of using passive-aggression and emotional blackmail is problematic. They might be struggling with their mental health but are not handling it constructively. The writer's financial constraints are valid, and they have the right to set boundaries, but the way they communicated their stance might have been harsh.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the writer's response was the right way to handle the friend's mental health crisis. Calling someone selfish in such a context can be hurtful and might push them further into distress. The writer might have needed to express their limitations without attacking the friend's character. However, the friend's behavior does cross a line with self-harm and suicidal comments, which should never be used as manipulation tactics.\n\nConsidering all this, the writer might not be entirely in the wrong because they had the right to say they couldn't afford the gift. But their phrasing as selfish could be seen as insensitive. The friend's actions are more concerning. However, in terms of the AITA framework, the focus is on who is wrong in their actions. The writer's response, while perhaps harsh, was in reaction to manipulation. The friend's behavior is worse, but the question is about the writer. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because the friend's actions are more egregious, but there's a nuance here. However, the writer might still be wrong for their response. Hmm, I'm a bit torn. But given the friend's manipulation and the writer's financial constraints, maybe the writer isn't in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
