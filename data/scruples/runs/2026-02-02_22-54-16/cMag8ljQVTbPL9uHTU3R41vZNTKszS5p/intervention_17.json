Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author being annoyed because his girlfriend pees a lot, causing various inconveniences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author loves his girlfriend but is clearly frustrated. The girlfriend's frequent bathroom breaks are affecting their daily activities, like driving, shopping, dining, and even intimate moments. The author mentions he feels bad about being annoyed but can't ignore the impact it's having on their life together.\n\nNow, why might the author be in the wrong? Well, maybe he's not considering that there could be an underlying medical issue. Even if she's 20 and healthy, maybe she has a condition like a UTI, diabetes, or overactive bladder that needs medical attention. The author might be dismissing her health concerns or not communicating his concerns in a supportive way. If he's accusing her of doing it to annoy him, that's a serious accusation and could be seen as invalidating her experiences.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is frustrated. The frequency is affecting their quality time and causing stress. It's understandable to feel inconvenienced when plans are constantly disrupted. However, the way he's approaching it\u2014thinking she might be doing it on purpose\u2014could be hurtful. He hasn't discussed it with her yet, which is a problem because assumptions can lead to misunderstandings.\n\nThe key here is communication. The author should probably talk to his girlfriend about his concerns, not just assume she's faking it. If there's a medical issue, addressing that could help. If it's just a habit or something else, they can find solutions together. But by not talking, the author is left with frustration and assumptions, which isn't healthy for the relationship.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's choosing to be annoyed without understanding the root cause and not communicating openly, that's a problem. He's projecting his frustration without considering her perspective. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not approaching the situation with empathy or communication. But if the situation is genuinely disruptive and he's trying to address it once he talks to her, maybe not. But based on the information given, he's not in the wrong for feeling frustrated, but he is in the wrong for not addressing it constructively.\n"
