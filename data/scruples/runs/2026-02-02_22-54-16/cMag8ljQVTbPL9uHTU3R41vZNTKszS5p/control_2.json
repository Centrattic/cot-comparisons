Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for being annoyed by their girlfriend's frequent bathroom trips. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author mentions that their girlfriend has to stop often during drives, shopping, dinners, and even during movies or intimate moments. They love her but feel inconvenienced. The question is whether the author is being unreasonable.\n\nFrequent urination can have medical causes, even if she's healthy. Maybe she's drinking a lot of water or has a medical condition like a UTI or diabetes. The author doesn't mention discussing this with her, which is important. Before judging, it's crucial to check if there's an underlying issue. \n\nOn the other hand, if she's healthy and the frequency is normal for her, the author's reaction might be about patience in a relationship. However, if the author is genuinely annoyed to the point of considering it a problem, they should communicate it respectfully. But the key here is that the author hasn't addressed it with her yet. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong if the girlfriend's bathroom habits are medically necessary and beyond her control. But if it's habitual and she's not seeking medical advice, the author's frustration could be valid. However, the author's suspicion that she's doing it to annoy him is a red flag. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's mistake might be not talking to her first instead of seeking validation here. If the author hasn't discussed this with her, it's hard to say he's the asshole. But if there's no medical reason and she's choosing to go frequently, the author's annoyance could be justified. \n\nHowever, the author's tone suggests he's not sure and feels bad for being annoyed. That might indicate he's overreacting. The fact that the girlfriend is healthy is noted, but maybe she's overhydrating or has other habits. \n\nOn the other hand, expecting someone to constantly wait for bathroom breaks in various situations could be a test of relationship patience. If it's causing significant stress, the author should address it. But the answer depends on whether there's a valid reason. Since the scenario doesn't confirm a medical issue, the author's reaction might be normal. \n\nBut in the absence of communication, it's hard to judge. The author might need to talk to her first. Since the question is whether he's the asshole, and he hasn't addressed it yet, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because his reaction is based on personal frustration, but he hasn't acted inconsiderately yet. However, if the girlfriend's behavior is within normal limits, the author's annoyance might be unwarranted. But without more info, it's a judgment call. \n\nI think the answer is B because the author hasn't taken action yet and is seeking advice. The problem is his perception, not his actions. Unless there's a clear medical reason, but the question states she's healthy. Wait, the user says she's \"perfectly healthy,\" so maybe the author is wrong to be annoyed. But the answer might depend on cultural norms and personal tolerance. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling annoyed, but he should address it with his girlfriend. Since the question is about being the asshole, and he hasn't done anything to harm the relationship yet, the answer is B.\n"
