Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being annoyed that their girlfriend goes to the bathroom so much. The question is whether the author is the asshole (AITA) here. The options are A (yes, they're wrong) or B (no, they're not).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend has been with the author for almost a year and living together for two months. She goes to the bathroom frequently, causing inconvenience in various situations like driving, shopping, dinners, and even during movies or foreplay. The author is annoyed but feels bad about it because he loves her. He's wondering if he's the asshole for being annoyed and if he should talk to her about it.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points here are the frequency of bathroom breaks and the impact on their daily activities. The author is frustrated because these breaks are causing inconvenience. But is that frustration justified?\n\nFirst, consider the girlfriend's health. The user mentions she's 20 and \"perfectly healthy,\" but maybe there's an underlying medical issue. Even if she seems healthy, frequent urination can be a symptom of something like diabetes, UTIs, or other conditions. However, the author isn't suggesting she has a medical condition, so perhaps he hasn't considered that. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong for being annoyed, not about her health.\n\nSecond, the author's reaction. He's annoyed, which is a valid emotion, but how he handles it matters. The question is about whether his annoyance makes him the asshole. If he's being inconsiderate of her needs or not, that's a factor. However, if his annoyance is due to her needing something basic like using the bathroom, that's different. But if he's being inconsiderate, maybe he's in the wrong.\n\nThird, communication. The author mentions he's considering not talking to her about it if he's the asshole. The fact that he's thinking about it shows he's aware that his feelings might not be the only consideration. If he hasn't discussed it with her, maybe he's not in the wrong yet, but if he's been annoyed for a long time without addressing it, perhaps he's not handling it constructively.\n\nAnother angle: does the frequency of bathroom visits fall within a normal range? Going to the bathroom once every hour or multiple times an hour might be excessive. However, the author is the one who states that she's \"perfectly healthy,\" so maybe he's dismissing her actual needs. If she's going to the bathroom frequently but it's normal for her, then his annoyance is about her natural bodily functions, which could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if it's genuinely excessive and affecting their quality of life, he might have a legitimate concern.\n\nBut the key is whether his annoyance is justified. If she's going to the bathroom as much as anyone else would, then he's being unreasonable. If it's more than average and causing real inconveniences, maybe she should address it with her doctor. However, the author is the one who's annoyed, not her. So if he's reacting negatively to her natural needs, he's the one being inconsiderate. But if there's an actual medical issue, that's different. But the author doesn't seem to think there is one.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, partners should accommodate each other's needs. If her bathroom use is normal, he should adjust. If it's not normal, maybe she should seek medical advice. But the author is annoyed and hasn't talked to her about it. So maybe he's wrong for not addressing it constructively instead of being annoyed. Alternatively, if her bathroom use is genuinely affecting their activities, he has a right to be concerned.\n\nBut the question is about whether he's in the wrong. If he's being annoyed by his partner's natural bodily functions without a valid reason, then yes, he's being unreasonable. However, if her bathroom use is excessive and impacting their life, maybe he's justified. Since the user says she's healthy, it's possible that her bathroom use is normal, so his annoyance is unwarranted. Therefore, he's in the wrong for being annoyed at her for a natural function.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the author's tone. He mentions pausing movies and foreplay, which could be seen as trivializing her needs. If she's going to the bathroom frequently, maybe due to a health reason, he should be more understanding. His frustration might come off as inconsiderate, making him the asshole.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's being annoyed by a natural bodily function and not addressing it constructively, which shows a lack of consideration for his partner's needs.\n"
