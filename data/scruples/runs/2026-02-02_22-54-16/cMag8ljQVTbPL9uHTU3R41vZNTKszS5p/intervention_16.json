Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The author is annoyed because his girlfriend pees a lot, which causes various inconveniences during their time together. He loves her, but it's getting on his nerves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The girlfriend is 20, healthy, and the author mentions she's not sick. But she's peeing frequently in different situations\u2014driving, shopping, dinner, etc. The author feels inconvenienced and wonders if he's being unreasonable.\n\nThe key points here are about normal bodily functions and how they affect relationships. Peeing is a natural need, and everyone has different bathroom habits. The author is frustrated because it's disrupting their activities. But is he wrong for feeling that way?\n\nI should think about typical social norms. People do need to use the bathroom, and it's understandable that someone would need to go frequently. However, if it's affecting the relationship's quality, communication is key. The author hasn't mentioned discussing this with his girlfriend yet, just that he's annoyed and unsure if he's in the wrong.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he hasn't communicated his feelings, maybe he's not in the wrong for being annoyed, but he might need to talk to her. However, the problem could be a misunderstanding. For example, maybe she's drinking a lot of water, which is healthy but causes more bathroom trips. Alternatively, there could be an underlying medical issue even if she's considered healthy.\n\nBut the author states she's \"perfectly healthy,\" so maybe it's just a habit. However, he's not in the wrong for feeling inconvenienced. It's a common issue in relationships to have personal preferences that clash. The real issue is whether his annoyance is justified. Since it's a natural bodily function, maybe he's being overly sensitive. But again, if it's affecting their activities, it's valid to feel that way.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether being annoyed at a partner's normal biological needs makes one an \"asshole.\" Generally, people have to accommodate each other's needs. However, there's a line where one person's needs become burdensome. The author might be in a gray area, but since the girlfriend isn't ill, it's hard to say he's wrong for feeling this way. However, before labeling him, it's important to consider if he's being overly critical. He might need to communicate and find a solution together, but that doesn't mean he's the asshole for having these feelings. So the answer is B.\n"
