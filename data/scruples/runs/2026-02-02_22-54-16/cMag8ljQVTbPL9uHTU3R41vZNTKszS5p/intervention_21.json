Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for being annoyed because their girlfriend goes to the bathroom a lot. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe girlfriend is 20 and healthy, but she's going to the bathroom frequently. The author feels this is inconvenient in various situations\u2014long drives, shopping, dinners, even during movies or intimate moments. They're annoyed and wonder if they're the asshole (AITA) for feeling that way.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author is expressing frustration over something that's a normal bodily function. People need to use the bathroom, and it's a basic human need. The girlfriend might not be able to control how often she needs to go, especially if she's healthy. So maybe the author is overreacting here. But on the other hand, if it's affecting their quality time together and causing stress, maybe there's a valid concern.\n\nWait, the author mentions that the girlfriend is \"perfectly healthy,\" so it's not a medical issue. That's important. But maybe there's something else causing frequent urination, like drinking a lot of fluids? The author didn't consider that. They just assume she's doing it on purpose or it's a habit. The girlfriend might have no control over it. \n\nAlso, the author hasn't talked to her about their feelings yet. They're worried about being an asshole, so maybe they should communicate first. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong now. If someone is annoyed by their partner's normal bodily functions, that could be seen as unreasonable. It's a common thing, and everyone has different frequencies. Unless there's a medical issue, it's not something the girlfriend can change. \n\nBut the author is frustrated because it's affecting their activities. However, the key point is that the author's annoyance is directed at something that's a natural part of life. Maybe they need to adjust their expectations and find ways to accommodate it, rather than being annoyed. So in that case, the author might be in the wrong for being annoyed over something that's not the girlfriend's fault. \n\nAlternatively, if the frequency is genuinely excessive and there's no medical reason, maybe there's a valid concern. But the girlfriend is described as healthy, so that's not the case here. Therefore, the author's annoyance is misplaced. The answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they're upset over something that's a normal part of life and not the girlfriend's fault.\n"
