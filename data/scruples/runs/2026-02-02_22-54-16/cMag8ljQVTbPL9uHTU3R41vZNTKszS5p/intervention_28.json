Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed by his girlfriend peeing a lot. Let me start by reading through the problem again to understand all the details.\n\nThe author and his girlfriend have been together almost a year and live together for two months. He loves her but is really annoyed because she has to pee a lot. Examples include needing to stop driving every 2 hours, shopping trips requiring bathroom breaks, waiting at dinner, and even interrupting movies or intimate moments. He's unsure if she's doing it on purpose and feels bad for being annoyed but is concerned he might be the asshole (AITA) here.\n\nFirst, I should consider the possible medical reasons. The girlfriend is 20 and healthy, but frequent urination can be a symptom of conditions like diabetes, overactive bladder, or even anxiety. The author mentions she's healthy, but maybe it's worth checking if she's had any medical evaluations. However, the author hasn't brought this up yet, so that's a point to consider.\n\nNext, the social aspect. The author is feeling inconvenienced, which is understandable. However, he's the one who hasn't communicated his feelings yet. The question is whether his annoyance is justified. In relationships, communication is key. If he's been feeling this way for a while without talking to her, maybe he's not handling it the right way. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong for being annoyed, not for not communicating.\n\nThe author's frustration is real, but maybe he's overreacting? Frequent bathroom breaks can disrupt plans, but that doesn't make his feelings invalid. However, if it's a medical issue, he should approach it empathetically. The problem is, without knowing the root cause, it's hard to judge. The girlfriend might be dealing with something she can't control, or maybe she's not aware of her frequency.\n\nBut the author is the one who hasn't mentioned his concerns yet. If he's been annoyed for a while and hasn't talked to her, perhaps he's not handling it maturely. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for his annoyance, not his communication. If his annoyance is based on a lack of understanding, maybe he's not the asshole. Alternatively, if he's making assumptions (like thinking she's doing it to annoy him), that could be problematic.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, people do need to use the bathroom, and partners should accommodate each other's needs. But if it's excessive and affecting their quality time, there's a balance. The author's situation seems to be affecting their activities, so it's a fair concern. However, the author's approach is to ask if he's the asshole for being annoyed, not if he's handling it wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong for feeling annoyed. However, the right approach would be to communicate with his girlfriend and see if there's an underlying issue. But the question is about being in the wrong for the annoyance itself. Since the girlfriend is healthy, but the frequency is high, it's possible he's justified. But if there's a medical reason, that's different. Since the author hasn't addressed it yet, maybe he's not in the wrong for his feelings but should address it constructively. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
