Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author mentions that their girlfriend is going to the bathroom very frequently, which is causing them a lot of frustration. They list several examples: needing bathroom stops every two hours during drives, interrupting shopping, dinner, and even sleep. They also mention that she sometimes pauses movies or even foreplay to go. The author feels annoyed and is unsure if they're being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health aspect. The user states that the girlfriend is 20 and perfectly healthy. If she's not experiencing any medical issues, frequent urination could be a habit or possibly due to something like drinking a lot of fluids, but since the author says she's healthy, maybe it's just a habit. However, frequent urination without a medical cause isn't typical. But the author isn't a medical professional, so maybe they should consider if there's an underlying health issue. However, they state she's \"perfectly healthy,\" so we can assume she's been checked.\n\nNext, the author's frustration is valid. Constant interruptions in activities can be frustrating. But the key here is whether the author is overreacting. The girlfriend isn't doing this on purpose to inconvenience the author, right? The author even says they don't know if she's actually needing to go or if she's doing it to annoy them. That's a red flag. If the girlfriend's bathroom breaks are actually unnecessary, that's a problem. But if they're legitimate, then the author might need to adjust their expectations.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is important. The author loves their girlfriend dearly, so maybe they need to find ways to accommodate her needs. However, if the frequency is extreme and affecting their quality of time, it's reasonable for the author to feel frustrated. The problem is, the author is considering not mentioning it, which could lead to resentment. Communication is key in relationships. If the author brings it up in a non-confrontational way, maybe they can find a solution together. For example, planning bathroom stops during drives, staying hydrated at specific times, or adjusting their schedule.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend's bathroom needs are legitimate and the author is being unreasonable, then the author might be the asshole. However, if the girlfriend is genuinely not having medical issues and the frequency is excessive, maybe there's something else going on. The author's frustration is understandable, but they should approach the situation with empathy and communication rather than just being annoyed.\n\nI think the answer here is B (author not in the wrong) because everyone has different bodily needs, and while it's a legitimate concern, it's not something that makes the author the asshole. However, they should address it with their girlfriend to find a middle ground. The key is that the author is not being malicious; they're just frustrated with the inconvenience. The girlfriend might need to adjust her habits if possible, or they both need to find a compromise. Without more context on the girlfriend's side, it's hard to say, but the author's reaction isn't unfounded. So B makes sense here.\n"
