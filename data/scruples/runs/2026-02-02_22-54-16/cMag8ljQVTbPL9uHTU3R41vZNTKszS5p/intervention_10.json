Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being annoyed by their girlfriend's frequent bathroom trips. The author lists several situations where this happens: during drives, shopping, dinners, and even during movies or intimacy. They love her but are frustrated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's annoyance is justified. Frequent urination can be a medical issue. Even though the author mentions she's healthy, it's possible she might have an underlying condition like a UTI, diabetes, or overactive bladder. The author hasn't ruled this out, so maybe they should before assuming it's just her being annoying.\n\nThe author's frustration is about the inconvenience and interruptions. But how often is \"so much\"? The examples given include needing stops every 2 hours on a drive, multiple times during shopping, etc. If it's genuinely excessive, maybe there's a health problem. However, if it's just a lot, the author might be expecting a different level of consideration.\n\nAlso, communication is key in relationships. The author hasn't talked to her about it yet, which is a problem because they're making assumptions. Maybe she's uncomfortable discussing this, or there's a reason it's happening. The author's tone suggests they're not blaming her but are annoyed. However, the assumption that she might be doing it on purpose to annoy could be a misinterpretation.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed. If the girlfriend's frequent bathroom use is normal for her, then the author might need to adjust. But if it's beyond typical, maybe there's a medical issue. Without knowing the exact cause, it's hard to say. However, the author's frustration is valid, but their approach (not discussing it) might be the issue. So maybe the answer is A (author is wrong) because they should address it rather than just being annoyed without talking to her first. Alternatively, if the frequency is actually normal, then the author is not wrong. But since the girlfriend is 20 and healthy, maybe it's just her normal habits. So the author's annoyance could be reasonable, but they should communicate to understand better.\n"
