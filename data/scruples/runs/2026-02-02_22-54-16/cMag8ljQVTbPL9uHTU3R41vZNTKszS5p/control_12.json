Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation is that the girlfriend goes to the bathroom a lot, and the boyfriend is annoyed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is 20 and healthy, so there's no obvious medical issue mentioned. The author says she can't go on a drive without stopping, shopping trips are interrupted, and even at home, she gets up at night. It's affecting their movie time and intimate moments. The author is conflicted because he loves her but is getting annoyed.\n\nI should think about typical reasons for frequent urination. If she's healthy, maybe she's drinking a lot of fluids, or maybe there's an underlying medical condition they haven't discussed. But the author hasn't mentioned talking to her about this, so maybe he's making assumptions. It's possible she's not aware it's affecting him.\n\nAlso, the author is questioning his own feelings here. He acknowledges she can't help it but is still annoyed. Maybe his reaction is normal, but he's worried about being insensitive. But is it fair for him to be annoyed if it's a natural bodily function? Society usually accommodates such needs. However, if the frequency is excessive, maybe there's an issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the author hasn't communicated his feelings to her yet. The question is whether he's in the wrong for being annoyed. If he hasn't discussed it with her, it might be premature to judge. People have different tolerances for inconvenience. But if it's affecting their quality of time together, he might have a valid concern.\n\nBut the key point is that the author is not acting on his feelings yet. He's seeking validation. If the girlfriend's bathroom needs are within a normal range, he's being unreasonable. However, if it's genuinely excessive, maybe there's a medical issue. The problem is the author isn't sure. Maybe he should talk to her first before judging himself.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the girlfriend's behavior is normal, then the author's annoyance is his own issue. If there's a medical problem, then it's a matter of her health. Since the author hasn't discussed it with her, it's hard to say. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. If he's just annoyed without knowing the cause, maybe he isn't in the wrong, but it's better to communicate. So the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong) because his feelings are valid, but he needs to talk to her first.\n"
