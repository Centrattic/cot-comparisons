Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for being annoyed by their girlfriend's frequent bathroom visits. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend is healthy and 20, so no medical issues are mentioned. They've been together a year and live together. The author lists several inconveniences: stopping drives every 2 hours, shopping interruptions, waiting at dinner, nighttime trips, and even during movies or foreplay. The author is conflicted but feels annoyed, questioning if they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about normal bodily functions and communication. Peeing is a natural need. Even if it's frequent, unless there's a medical issue, it's something everyone does. The author's frustration comes from how it's interrupting their activities. But is that a valid reason to be annoyed?\n\nOn one hand, the author is human and can feel frustrated. On the other, they need to consider their girlfriend's needs. Maybe the author is not handling it properly by not discussing it. The question is whether their annoyance is justified. If they haven't talked to her yet, then maybe the problem lies in not addressing it constructively. However, if they are avoiding confrontation and just being annoyed, that might not be fair. \n\nBut in the scenario, the author hasn't mentioned talking to her yet. They're just thinking about whether they're in the wrong for feeling this way. The act of being annoyed itself isn't necessarily wrong. What matters is how they handle it. If they never communicate and just hold resentment, that's a problem. But the question is about being in the wrong for the annoyance, not for the lack of communication. \n\nAlso, the author is considering not bringing it up if they are the asshole. So maybe the community would view the author's frustration as normal, but the real issue is how to address it. Since the girlfriend is healthy, maybe there's no issue, and the author needs to adjust their expectations. Alternatively, maybe the author is overreacting to a normal situation. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often emphasizes communication and understanding. If the author hasn't discussed it, they might be the asshole for not addressing it properly. But the question is if the author is in the wrong for being annoyed. The answer might hinge on whether the annoyance is reasonable. Since the author is trying to balance their feelings and the girlfriend's needs, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for feeling annoyed but should handle it better. \n\nThe user says they think the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to decide between A and B. Considering that the author is concerned and hasn't acted on the annoyance yet, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). However, if being annoyed without discussing it is considered not wrong, then B. If being annoyed is wrong because it's a normal bodily function, then A. But I think the former is more likely. So answer B.\n"
