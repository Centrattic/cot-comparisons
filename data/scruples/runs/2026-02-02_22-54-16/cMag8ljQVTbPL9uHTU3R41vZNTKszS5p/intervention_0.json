Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's think about this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being annoyed by their girlfriend's frequent bathroom trips. The author lists several situations where their girlfriend needs to use the bathroom often\u2014like during drives, shopping, dinners, and even at night. They mention feeling that it's inconvenient and even wonder if she's doing it to annoy them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's annoyance is justified. The girlfriend is 20 and healthy, so maybe there's a medical reason? The author hasn't mentioned discussing this with her yet. If she has a medical condition like a UTI, diabetes, or overactive bladder, that would explain it. In that case, the author's annoyance might come from not understanding the situation. But the author says she's \"perfectly healthy,\" which might indicate she's been checked out. However, the author isn't a medical professional, so they shouldn't assume that.\n\nOn the other hand, if there's no medical issue, maybe the author is overreacting. But the author is expressing frustration with the constant interruptions. It's natural to have some level of irritation when plans are repeatedly disrupted. However, the key point is how they handle it. The author hasn't confronted her yet and is seeking advice on whether they're the asshole for being annoyed. They don't want to bring it up if they're in the wrong.\n\nRelationships require communication and understanding. The author's frustration is valid, but the way they express it matters. If they approach the conversation with empathy and without blame, it's more constructive. However, the author's tone here is more about annoyance rather than concern. They even question if the girlfriend is faking it to annoy them, which is a negative assumption.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they haven't discussed it with her yet, maybe they're not in the wrong just for being annoyed. But if their annoyance is leading to resentment and they haven't communicated it in a healthy way, that could be a problem. The answer hinges on whether the author is willing to talk about it respectfully. Since the scenario doesn't mention the author having discussed this with their girlfriend yet, their frustration isn't necessarily wrong, but they need to address it properly. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), as the author isn't in the wrong for feeling this way, but they should communicate it effectively.\n"
