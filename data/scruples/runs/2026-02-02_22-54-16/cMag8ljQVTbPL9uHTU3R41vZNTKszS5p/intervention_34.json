Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed by their girlfriend's frequent bathroom visits. The situation is described in detail, and the user thinks the author isn't wrong, but I need to determine if that's accurate.\n\nFirst, I should consider normal bathroom habits. How often is \"normal\"? On average, people might use the bathroom several times a day, but if it's excessively frequent, that could be a problem. The author mentions that their girlfriend needs to stop every 2 hours on a drive, multiple times when shopping, after dinner, and even during the night. That does sound like a significant frequency.\n\nNext, the author is feeling inconvenienced in various situations: movies, shopping, intimacy, driving, etc. They even wonder if the girlfriend is doing it to annoy them. But the girlfriend is 20 and healthy, so maybe there's no medical issue. However, the author hasn't mentioned discussing this with a healthcare professional. Maybe there's an underlying issue like a UTI, diabetes, or overactive bladder that's not diagnosed yet. Without knowing that, it's possible the girlfriend isn't aware of the impact or there's a medical cause.\n\nBut the author is expressing frustration. Is it reasonable to feel annoyed? Well, relationships require compromise and understanding. If one partner's habits are causing significant inconvenience, the other might feel frustrated. However, the key here is whether the author's reaction is justified. The author loves her and acknowledges she can't help it, so the annoyance might be more about the frequency affecting their plans and enjoyment.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If the girlfriend is healthy, maybe the author should adjust and be more accommodating. But if the frequency is abnormal and causing problems, maybe the author should talk about it. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed, not for not addressing it yet. The author is seeking advice on if their feelings are valid.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for people to have different bathroom needs. But when it disrupts daily activities and social plans, it's a point of contention. The author isn't blaming the girlfriend but is expressing frustration. It's important to note that the author hasn't confronted the girlfriend yet, which might be a step they should take. However, the question isn't about what they should do next, but whether they're in the wrong for being annoyed.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's annoyance is understandable given the described situations. However, the answer depends on whether the situation is within normal limits. If the girlfriend's bathroom frequency is indeed abnormal (which might require a medical check), the author's frustration could be justified. But if it's a normal variation, then maybe the author should adjust. However, since the girlfriend is described as healthy, maybe there's no issue, making the author's annoyance unwarranted. But without knowing her medical status, it's hard to say. The author might need to approach the topic sensitively rather than assuming the worst. But based on the info given, the author's feelings are valid, so they might not be in the wrong.\n"
