Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a guy who's annoyed because his girlfriend pees a lot. He mentions various situations where this is a problem, like driving, shopping, movies, etc. He even suspects she might be doing it to annoy him, but he's unsure if he's the asshole for feeling that way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is 20, healthy, and it's been a year together. The author is clearly frustrated because the bathroom breaks are causing inconvenience. But is he in the wrong for being annoyed?\n\nWell, physiological needs are natural. If she's healthy, there's no medical issue, so maybe she's just naturally going more than average. But maybe there's something else, like anxiety or a habit. However, the author's concern is about his annoyance. The question is whether his annoyance is justified.\n\nOn one hand, everyone has their limits. If her bathroom breaks are really affecting their plans and causing frustration, he might have a right to feel that. On the other hand, he should consider whether she has control over it. If she can't help it, maybe he needs to adjust his expectations as a partner.\n\nBut the key point here is whether he's in the wrong. If he's being annoyed by a natural bodily function that she can't help, then maybe he's being unreasonable. However, if he's overreacting and not considering her needs, he might be in the wrong. But if she's genuinely healthy and it's just her body's rhythm, he might be the one not adjusting enough as a partner.\n\nWait, the author mentions he loves her dearly. So maybe he should be more accommodating. But at the same time, it's okay to feel frustrated. However, the line is crossed if he's blaming her for something she can't control. If he's acting out or making her feel bad about it, he's in the wrong. But the question is just about whether he's in the wrong for feeling annoyed. If he's not acting on it, just feeling annoyed, maybe that's normal. But if he's planning to confront her or be judgmental, then yes.\n\nBut the author is asking if he's the asshole for being annoyed, not for acting on it. So maybe it's more about whether his annoyance is valid. If she's healthy and it's just her body, maybe he's being a bit selfish. However, if the frequency is excessive, maybe there's an underlying issue even if she's considered healthy. But the author states she's perfectly healthy.\n\nHmm. The answer depends on whether the author is overreacting. If she's healthy, he should just deal with it as part of being in a relationship. So he's not in the wrong for feeling annoyed, but he might be in the wrong if he's not adjusting. But the question is about being in the wrong for being annoyed. If he's just annoyed without acting out, maybe not. However, if he's being unreasonable about it, then yes.\n\nThe community usually advises that if someone can't adjust to a partner's normal habits, they might be the asshole. So here, if his girlfriend's bathroom breaks are normal, he should manage his annoyance. So answer A (he's in the wrong) if the annoyance is unwarranted. Answer B if it's understandable.\n\nBut the author is asking if he's the asshole. The key is to see if his reaction is reasonable. If the situations he describes are really disruptive and she's not ill, maybe he's being too sensitive. But maybe it's just a personal difference. The answer might be A because he's annoyed by something natural and healthy. So he's the asshole for being annoyed. But the alternative is that it's a valid frustration. \n\nIn the AITA subreddit, similar cases often result in the person being the asshole if they're upset about a partner's normal bodily functions. So the answer might be A. But I need to be careful. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author is being reasonable, then B. But if he's overreacting, then A. Given the situations described, it seems like he's overreacting. So answer A.\n"
