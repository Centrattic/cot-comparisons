Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is annoyed that their girlfriend pees a lot, leading to frequent bathroom breaks and inconveniences. They're wondering if they're the asshole (AITA) for being annoyed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The girlfriend is healthy and only 20, so there's no medical issue causing this. The author mentions that she can't go more than 2 hours in the car without needing to stop, frequent bathroom breaks during activities, and even interrupting movies or intimate moments. The author feels this is excessive and is getting annoyed, but they also feel bad about being annoyed and are hesitant to bring it up.\n\nOn one hand, the author is expressing frustration about the frequency of bathroom breaks. It's natural to feel inconvenienced, especially when it's affecting their time together. But on the other hand, the girlfriend doesn't have a medical condition, so it's part of her normal physiology. The author might be overreacting if the girlfriend is indeed going to the bathroom normally and not exaggerating. However, if it's genuinely affecting their relationship and daily activities, it's reasonable for the author to feel some frustration.\n\nBut wait, the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. In relationships, communication is crucial. The author hasn't mentioned talking to their girlfriend about how they feel, so it's unclear if there's a misunderstanding. The author is considering not bringing it up, thinking they might be the asshole. However, the girlfriend's behavior isn't harmful or malicious, so the author's annoyance might be a personal issue rather than the girlfriend's fault. But if the girlfriend isn't aware of how her actions affect the author, maybe the author isn't approaching it the right way. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend's bathroom habits are normal but just more frequent than the author is comfortable with, the author's annoyance isn't justified. However, if it's reasonable for the author to feel inconvenienced, then it's a matter of both parties needing to communicate. Since the author hasn't talked to her yet, it's hard to say. But the fact that the author is considering being an asshole suggests maybe they are overreacting. Alternatively, maybe the girlfriend is being inconsiderate, but since there's no medical issue, it's just her body's normal function. \n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the answer often leans towards the person being reasonable but needing to communicate. Here, the author might not be the asshole for feeling annoyed, but they should address it in a kind way. However, the problem is whether the author is wrong for being annoyed. If the girlfriend's actions are normal, the author's frustration is valid but might need to be addressed through conversation rather than silent annoyance. So the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for feeling annoyed, but they should communicate it properly. Alternatively, if the author is being unreasonable, then A. But since the girlfriend is healthy, it's not her fault. So the author isn't the asshole for being annoyed, but they need to talk about it. So the answer is B.\n"
