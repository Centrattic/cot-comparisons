Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong because they're annoyed by their girlfriend peeing a lot. The question is whether the author is the asshole here, with options A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The girlfriend is peeing frequently, causing various inconveniences: stopping drives every 2 hours, needing bathrooms while shopping, delaying dinner, waking up at night. The author is annoyed and wonders if they're being unreasonable. The girlfriend is young and healthy, so maybe it's not a medical issue. The author even suspects she's doing it on purpose now.\n\nNow, considering the options. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my input. \n\nIn such situations, it's important to consider both sides. The author's annoyance is valid because frequent bathroom breaks can disrupt activities. However, the girlfriend's health is mentioned as okay, but maybe there's an underlying issue. The author hasn't discussed this with her yet, so maybe they should. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is just annoyed and hasn't confronted her, maybe they aren't the asshole. However, if the girlfriend doesn't have a medical condition causing this and the author is just being inconsiderate, that's different. But the author does express love and feeling bad about being annoyed. \n\nAlso, the author's examples (stopping drives, shopping, dinner) are common activities where bathroom breaks are necessary. Maybe the author is overreacting? Or maybe the frequency is excessive. If the girlfriend's behavior is affecting their relationship negatively, the author might need to address it, but that's about communication.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed. Annoyance isn't necessarily wrong, but if the author is expecting the girlfriend to change a natural bodily function without understanding, that's the issue. However, if there's no medical issue, maybe the girlfriend isn't doing it on purpose. The author should probably talk to her first before assuming she's doing it to annoy him.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because annoyance isn't inherently wrong, and the author's concern is valid. However, the right action would be to discuss it rather than remain passive. But the question is about being in the wrong, not the next step. So B makes sense.\n"
