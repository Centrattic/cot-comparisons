Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about their girlfriend peeing a lot and causing inconvenience. The author feels annoyed and is wondering if they're being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's frustration is understandable. Frequent bathroom breaks can disrupt plans, especially during activities like driving or watching a movie. They mention it's happening a lot\u2014every 2 hours on a drive, shopping trips, dinners, even during sleep. That's a lot of interruptions. It's natural to feel annoyed when something is affecting daily life and relationship quality.\n\nBut then, the girlfriend is only 20 and healthy. So maybe she's just naturally a frequent urinator? Some people's bodies just work that way. It's not necessarily a medical issue. The author knows she can't help it, yet the annoyance persists. The key here is how the author is handling it. They're considering whether to talk about it, which is a good step because communication is important in relationships. However, the author's suspicion that she might be doing it to annoy them is a red flag. That could lead to mistrust and resentment if voiced without evidence.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, feeling annoyed isn't the same as being wrong. Everyone has different tolerances for inconveniences. But the way the author is thinking\u2014questioning if it's intentional\u2014might indicate a lack of empathy or understanding. If the girlfriend is genuinely not in control, it's a matter of adjusting and supporting each other. However, if the author brings up their annoyance in a respectful way, that's part of a healthy relationship. So the answer depends on whether the author is just feeling frustrated (which is normal) or being dismissive of her needs. Since the author is considering not mentioning it out of guilt, maybe they're not the asshole. But if they do bring it up unkindly, that could be the issue. The question is whether the author is in the wrong now, not if their future actions will matter. Since they're reflecting on their feelings, the answer might be B, they're not the asshole, but they need to communicate properly.\n"
