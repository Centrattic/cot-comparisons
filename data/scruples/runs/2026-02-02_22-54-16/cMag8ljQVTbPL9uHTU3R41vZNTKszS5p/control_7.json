Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author being annoyed because their girlfriend has to go to the bathroom frequently. They mention specific examples like needing to stop every two hours while driving, interrupting activities, and even pausing foreplay. The author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for being annoyed by this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is described as 20 years old and perfectly healthy. The author knows she can't help it. Frequent urination can have medical causes, but the author states she's healthy, so maybe it's just her natural tendency. However, the author is expressing frustration because it's causing inconvenience in their daily life and their plans.\n\nNow, the key points are whether the author's annoyance is justified. On one hand, it's understandable to be annoyed if someone is constantly needing to interrupt activities. On the other hand, the author loves their girlfriend and acknowledges that she can't help it. The question is if their annoyance makes them the asshole.\n\nI should think about reasonable expectations in a relationship. People have different needs and habits, and it's part of being in a relationship to accommodate each other. However, if the girlfriend's need is excessive and causing significant disruption, maybe there's a balance to be found. But the author hasn't approached her about it yet, which is important. Maybe discussing it calmly would help both sides understand each other's perspectives.\n\nThe author is worried that they might be the asshole if they bring it up. But not addressing it could lead to resentment. However, the way they frame their question suggests they're struggling with whether their feelings are valid. If the girlfriend's bathroom breaks are indeed frequent and unavoidable, the author might need to adjust their expectations or find ways to plan around it. However, if the author is being overly accommodating to the point of losing their own enjoyment, perhaps there's a valid point there.\n\nBut the main issue here is if the author is wrong for feeling annoyed. In many AITA scenarios, the key is whether the person's actions (or inactions) are unkind or unreasonable. If the author is not acting out their annoyance in a way that's hurtful, but just feeling it, maybe they aren't the asshole. However, if their annoyance is leading to negative actions or not considering their partner's needs, that's different.\n\nThe girlfriend's health is mentioned as okay, so unless there's an underlying medical issue not discussed, the author might need to accept this as part of her nature. But the author is already considering that she might be doing it to annoy them, which is a bit of a projection. That could indicate the author is being skeptical or maybe even a bit resentful without cause.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's annoyance is understandable, but if they haven't communicated with their girlfriend and are considering that she might be doing it on purpose, that could suggest they're not approaching the situation with enough empathy. The answer would depend on whether their reaction is proportionate and if they've tried to address it respectfully. Since they haven't mentioned discussing it with her yet, it's possible they're not entirely in the wrong, but they might benefit from talking it out rather than internalizing the frustration.\n"
