Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being annoyed by their girlfriend's frequent bathroom trips. First, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author's girlfriend is 20, healthy, and they've been together almost a year, living together for two months. She needs to stop every 2 hours in the car, interrupts shopping, dinner, and even sleep. The author feels she's either genuinely needing the bathroom or doing it to annoy him. The question is whether the author is the asshole (AITA) for feeling annoyed.\n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, the author is frustrated with the constant interruptions affecting their plans and intimacy. On the other, maybe the girlfriend has medical issues they haven't considered, or maybe she's using the bathroom as an excuse for other reasons. But the author hasn't mentioned discussing this with her, so maybe he's making assumptions.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend is healthy, then her frequent bathroom needs might be within normal range. However, the author's annoyance could be valid if it's causing real disruptions. However, he's making assumptions about her intentions (maybe she's doing it to annoy him), which isn't fair without talking to her. So, the problem might be that he's not communicating instead of her having a real issue.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author is frustrated but hasn't addressed it with her. Instead, he's airing his grievances anonymously. Maybe he's in the right to be frustrated, but his approach could be wrong if he's not considering her perspective. However, the question is if he's in the wrong for being annoyed. If her bathroom habits are normal, then his frustration might be misplaced. But if her frequency is abnormal, maybe there's a medical reason. Since the author says she's healthy, maybe it's just his own intolerance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he's overreacting. People have different bathroom needs, and if she's healthy, it might just be a quirk. But he's also mentioning pausing activities, which could be a valid inconvenience. The key here is whether his annoyance is justified. If the behavior is within normal limits, he might be the one being inconsiderate by not accommodating her needs. But if the frequency is excessive despite being healthy, maybe there's another issue. However, the author hasn't ruled out medical reasons by consulting a doctor. So, he's making assumptions without facts.\n\nIn conclusion, the author could be in the wrong if his frustration stems from her normal needs and he's not making reasonable adjustments. Alternatively, if her bathroom frequency is indeed abnormal and causing significant disruption, he might be in the right to seek a solution. But the answer hinges on whether the behavior is within the norm. Since he states she's healthy, it's more likely that his reaction is the issue, making him the asshole for not considering her needs and for his assumptions.\n"
