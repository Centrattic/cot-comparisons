Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend who goes to the bathroom a lot, causing the author a lot of inconvenience and annoyance. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for feeling this way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details given. The girlfriend is 20 and healthy, which suggests there's no medical issue causing the frequent bathroom breaks. However, the author mentions that she can't go on a 2-hour drive without needing a stop, shopping trips require bathroom breaks, and even at dinner, she needs to go after paying. She also gets up in the middle of the night and pauses activities like movies or even foreplay to use the bathroom. The author is worried that maybe she's just doing it to annoy him, but he's unsure.\n\nNow, the key here is to balance the author's feelings against the girlfriend's health and habits. Since there's no mention of a medical condition, the author might be frustrated by something that's within her control. However, the author also acknowledges that he loves her and doesn't want to accuse her without cause. The question is whether his annoyance is justified and if he's in the wrong for feeling that way.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, it's important to communicate openly. If the author is genuinely bothered by this, he should talk to her about it respectfully, but without blaming her. The problem arises if he's making assumptions that she's doing it to annoy him, which could be a projection of his own feelings. On the other hand, if her habits are significantly impacting their time together and causing frustration, it's reasonable to express that, provided it's done in a constructive way.\n\nHowever, the author hasn't communicated his feelings yet, so he's not in the wrong just for being annoyed. But if he's choosing not to address it out of fear of being the asshole, that might not be healthy. The main issue here is whether his annoyance is valid. Since the girlfriend's actions aren't harmful (assuming no health issues) and the author is frustrated with what seems like a normal biological function, it's possible he's overreacting. Yet, the frequency mentioned does seem high for a 20-year-old with no health problems. Maybe there's an underlying issue she hasn't mentioned, like stress or a hidden medical condition, but the author hasn't considered that. Alternatively, maybe she's just a person who needs to go often, and the author needs to adjust his expectations.\n\nIn summary, the author's annoyance is somewhat understandable, but he's not in the wrong. The real problem is the lack of communication. He should approach her to discuss it without accusatory language, to understand if there's a reason for the frequent bathroom visits and if there's a way to find a middle ground. Since he hasn't done that yet, he's not the asshole for feeling this way, but he needs to address it properly. So the answer is B, No.\n"
