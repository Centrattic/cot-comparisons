Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is annoyed because their girlfriend uses the bathroom a lot, which is causing them inconvenience in various situations like driving, shopping, dining, etc. They love her but are frustrated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider normal bathroom habits. How often is \"so much\"? The author mentions stopping every 2 hours while driving, which might be more frequent than average. But maybe there's a medical reason? The girlfriend is 20 and healthy, but maybe she's drinking a lot of fluids or has a condition they're not aware of. However, the author says she's perfectly healthy, so that might not be the case. \n\nThe author feels that the girlfriend is inconveniencing them. But is it reasonable to get annoyed? People have different needs, and while it's part of living with someone, maybe the author is overreacting? Or maybe not? If this is happening frequently and affecting their plans, it's understandable to be frustrated. However, the author should also consider her feelings and not make her feel guilty for a natural bodily function. \n\nThe key points are: the author is annoyed but doesn't want to accuse her of being annoying, which might be projecting. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to communicate issues without blaming the other person. The author hasn't mentioned talking to her about it yet, so maybe they should address it respectfully. But being annoyed isn't necessarily being in the wrong. However, if the annoyance leads to disrespect or resentment, that could be problematic. \n\nSo the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for feeling annoyed, but they should approach the situation with understanding and communication.\n"
