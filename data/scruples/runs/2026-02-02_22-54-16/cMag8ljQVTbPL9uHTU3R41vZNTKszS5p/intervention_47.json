Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is annoyed by their girlfriend peeing a lot, which is causing inconvenience in various situations like driving, shopping, and even during movies or foreplay. The question is whether the author is the asshole (AITA) here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is 20, healthy, and they've been together for a year. The author mentions that they love her dearly but are getting annoyed. The key points here are the frequency of bathroom breaks and the author's irritation. \n\nI should think about whether the author's annoyance is reasonable. Peeing frequently can be a normal thing for some people, but if it's excessive, it might be a health issue. However, the author states she's perfectly healthy. So maybe it's just her body's natural way. But the author is frustrated because these bathroom breaks are interrupting their activities. \n\nNow, the author is considering if they're being unreasonable. They feel bad for being annoyed but list specific examples. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author is hesitant to mention it to her, fearing they might be the asshole. But if the frequency is causing problems, maybe the author should talk to her. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not whether they should communicate. \n\nIs the author wrong for being annoyed? Well, being annoyed is a natural reaction when your plans are repeatedly interrupted. However, the author should consider if there's a medical reason first. The girlfriend might have a condition like overactive bladder or something else. But the author says she's healthy. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be overreacting. If she's genuinely healthy, then it's just part of her physiology. But if the author is constantly frustrated, maybe they need to adjust their expectations or activities. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Probably not, because they're feeling inconvenienced. However, the way they handle it matters. The key is whether their annoyance is justified or if they should be more supportive. \n\nIn terms of AITA, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because having a need to pee frequently isn't something one can control, and the author's annoyance is a valid reaction. But the author might need to address it with her instead of letting it build up. \n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong for being annoyed, but they should communicate with their girlfriend to find a solution.\n"
