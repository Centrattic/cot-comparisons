Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being annoyed by their girlfriend's frequent bathroom trips. The author lists several situations where this happens, like during drives, shopping, dinners, and even during movies or intimate moments. They mention that the girlfriend is healthy and only 20, so maybe there's no medical issue. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know if I agree.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's annoyance is justified. Peeing multiple times a day is normal, but the frequency described here seems excessive. The author mentions specific instances where it's causing inconvenience. However, the author also says they don't want to accuse the girlfriend of faking it to annoy them. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. \n\nIf the girlfriend is genuinely peeing that much, it could be a medical concern, like a UTI, diabetes, or overactive bladder. The author didn't mention discussing this with her, so maybe they should first check if there's an underlying health issue. But since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, perhaps the issue is the author's reaction rather than the situation itself. \n\nThe author is feeling inconvenienced, but they love their girlfriend. It's possible they're not approaching the situation with enough empathy. Even if the girlfriend is healthy, frequent bathroom breaks could be due to habits or anxiety. The author might need to communicate their feelings without blaming her. \n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend is exaggerating or faking bathroom needs, the author is within their right to be frustrated. But the key here is that the author isn't sure if it's real or intentional. Without knowing for sure, it's hard to judge. The author hasn't addressed the issue with her, so maybe they should talk about it first.\n\nIn terms of the question, the user wants a yes or no answer. The author's annoyance is understandable, but reacting negatively without discussing it could be the problem. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling that way, but their approach might be. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the frustration is valid, but the way they handle it could be improved. Alternatively, if the author is being inconsiderate without considering the girlfriend's needs, maybe A. But given the information, it's unclear if the girlfriend is faking it. The author's annoyance is justified if it's real, but they need to address it properly. So I think the answer is B.\n"
