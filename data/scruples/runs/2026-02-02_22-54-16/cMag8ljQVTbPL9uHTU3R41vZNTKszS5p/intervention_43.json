Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed by their girlfriend's frequent bathroom trips. The situation is that the girlfriend goes to the bathroom a lot\u2014like during drives, shopping, dinners, even in the middle of the night. The author feels it's inconvenient and even suspects she might be doing it on purpose.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the basics. Frequent urination can be a medical issue. Common causes include diabetes, UTIs, or even something like interstitial cystitis. But the author mentions she's 20 and perfectly healthy. However, \"perfectly healthy\" might not account for all possibilities. Maybe she hasn't seen a doctor? Could there be an underlying condition the author isn't aware of?\n\nThen there's the aspect of how the author is handling it. He's feeling annoyed and even wondering if she's doing it to annoy him. That's a red flag. Accusing a partner of intentionally causing inconvenience without evidence could be harmful. It might lead to unnecessary conflict or even mistrust. But at the same time, the author is seeking advice on whether it's reasonable to be annoyed, not necessarily accusing her of doing it on purpose yet.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is overreacting. If the girlfriend is genuinely having issues, even if it's a minor one, the author's frustration might be valid but needs to be addressed with understanding. However, if the author is making a big deal out of a normal bodily function, that's where he might be in the wrong.\n\nAlso, communication is important. The author hasn't mentioned this to her yet, which is good in a way because he's trying to see both sides. But if this is really affecting their quality time together, maybe a gentle conversation about it could help. The author could check if there's a medical reason first, and if not, then discuss ways to manage it without making her feel criticized.\n\nAnother angle: the author's annoyance could stem from a deeper issue. Maybe he's stressed or has other problems he's projecting onto this situation. It's possible he's using this as a way to vent about other relationship issues. But the question is specifically about the bathroom issue.\n\nSo, if the girlfriend's frequent urination is a medical issue, the author is not in the wrong for being frustrated, but he should approach it with empathy and support. However, if there's no medical cause and she's just doing it to be inconvenient, then maybe the author's annoyance is justified. But since the user hasn't mentioned any medical consultation, it's unclear.\n\nIn terms of the answer, the options are A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). Considering all that, the author's annoyance isn't inherently wrong, but his approach to handling it could be improved. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for feeling annoyed. Since the situation is presented as a genuine frustration, and the answer depends on context not provided (like medical factors), the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong). However, the author might need to address the situation with more understanding and communication rather than just being annoyed.\n"
