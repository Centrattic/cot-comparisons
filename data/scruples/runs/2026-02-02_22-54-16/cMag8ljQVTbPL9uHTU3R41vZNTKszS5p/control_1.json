Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed by his girlfriend's frequent bathroom trips. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the user is asking if it's his fault for feeling annoyed. The girlfriend is healthy, 20 years old, and they've been together for a year. They live together now. The author lists several situations where she needs to go pee often\u2014like during drives, shopping, after dinner, even during movies or intimate moments. He even suspects she might be doing it on purpose. He's conflicted because he loves her but this is getting really frustrating.\n\nI need to consider if the author's annoyance is justified. Well, normal people do need to use the bathroom, but the frequency here seems excessive. The author mentions that she's healthy, so maybe there's no medical reason. But even if she's healthy, people can have different bathroom habits. However, the key point is whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed by this.\n\nOn one hand, everyone has different body functions. If she's really that frequently needing to go, maybe it's a behavioral issue or a psychological factor. But on the other hand, the author is supposed to be patient in a relationship. But if it's causing constant disruptions, is it reasonable to feel frustrated?\n\nWait, but he hasn't talked to her about it yet. He's worried about bringing it up because he doesn't want to be the asshole. Maybe he should communicate his feelings instead of just being annoyed. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong now, not if he should talk to her.\n\nThe problem is whether his annoyance is unreasonable. If she's healthy and there's no medical issue, maybe he's overreacting. But if it's affecting their daily activities and intimacy, it's a valid concern. But the article might lean towards the author being wrong because he's focusing on his inconvenience rather than understanding her needs. Alternatively, maybe she's exaggerating the bathroom trips, and he's justified in being annoyed if it's unnecessary.\n\nWait, but the article's title is \"Am I the Asshole?\" So in these kinds of stories, usually, the person is the asshole if they're not considering the other person's perspective. If the girlfriend is truly in need, the author shouldn't be annoyed. But if she's faking it, then the author's annoyance is understandable. However, the user is asking if the author is wrong for being annoyed, not if the girlfriend is wrong. So maybe the answer is that the author is not in the wrong because his frustration is valid if the situation is causing him to be constantly inconvenienced. But maybe he should talk to her first.\n\nAlternatively, the answer might be that the author is wrong because he's not considering her health or possible stress, and he's making assumptions. But the story says she's healthy. Hmm.\n\nI think the key is that the author is annoyed by something that's a normal bodily function. Unless there's a medical issue, but the user says she's healthy. So maybe the author is in the wrong for being annoyed at something that's natural. But wait, the frequency is really high. Maybe there's an underlying issue he's not considering. But the user states that she's healthy, so perhaps the author should just accept it as part of her.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is right to be concerned because it could be a sign of a medical problem even if she says she's healthy. But the user hasn't taken her to the doctor, so he's just assuming she's okay. That's part of the problem\u2014maybe he should address it instead of just being annoyed. But the question is whether he's wrong for being annoyed, not whether he should act.\n\nSo, if the answer is A, the author is in the wrong for being annoyed because it's a normal bodily function. If B, then the author is not in the wrong because the frequency is excessive and affecting their life. Given that the user is asking if he's the asshole, the typical response in such stories is that the person is the asshole if they're not considering the other person's situation. But here, the girlfriend's situation is her needing to go, which is a normal thing. But the frequency is high. However, since the user hasn't checked for medical issues, maybe he's overreacting. But since she's healthy, perhaps he's just being impatient.\n\nI'm leaning towards B, the author is not in the wrong because the situation is affecting their life, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe A because he's annoyed at a natural bodily function. Hmm. I think the answer is B because if it's disrupting their life and there's no medical reason, he's justified in being annoyed. But if it's just a normal amount, then A. But the user says \"pees so much,\" which implies more than normal. So maybe B is correct. So the answer is B.\n"
