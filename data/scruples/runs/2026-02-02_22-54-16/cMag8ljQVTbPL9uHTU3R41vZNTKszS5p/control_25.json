Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author being annoyed by their girlfriend needing to use the bathroom frequently. The author lists several examples: stopping the car every 2 hours, needing bathrooms during shopping, after dinner, at night, even during movies or foreplay. The author is conflicted because they love their girlfriend but are getting annoyed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's annoyance is justified. The girlfriend is 20 and healthy, so maybe there's no medical issue. Frequent urination can be a sign of something like a UTI, diabetes, or even anxiety. But the author says she's healthy, so maybe it's just a habit or something else. However, the author should check if there's a medical reason first. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are the author's reaction. They are annoyed and considering whether to bring it up. The girlfriend is being inconvenienced, but is the author overreacting? The examples given are all about the author having to pause activities. However, the author is not considering the girlfriend's perspective. Maybe she's self-conscious, or there's an underlying issue. The author is making assumptions about her not needing to go, which could be dismissive of her needs.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author is holding back from talking about it, which might lead to resentment. But if the author brings it up in a dismissive way, that would be wrong. However, the author's concern is about their own feelings of being inconvenienced. The question is whether this is a valid concern or if the author is being unreasonable.\n\nThe girlfriend's behavior, if it's not due to a medical condition, might be a personal habit. The author's annoyance is about how often they have to adjust their plans. But the author is also not considering if their girlfriend has tried to manage this or if there are steps they can take together. For example, planning bathroom breaks in advance, staying hydrated appropriately, or using the bathroom before leaving the house.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is putting their own convenience above their partner's needs, which could be seen as inconsiderate. The girlfriend's basic needs should be a priority, and the author's frustration might stem from impatience or lack of empathy. The author might be expecting their partner to conform to their schedule rather than finding a balance. So, the author might be in the wrong because they are not addressing the issue compassionately and are focusing on their own irritation instead of looking for solutions or understanding.\n\nBut there's also the possibility that the girlfriend's behavior is excessive and the author is within their rights to be concerned. However, without a medical excuse, the author should approach this with sensitivity. If the author is making assumptions (like thinking she's doing it to annoy them), that's a problem. So overall, the author might be in the wrong for not communicating and for being dismissive of the girlfriend's needs, unless there's a valid medical reason.\n"
