Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a guy who's been with his girlfriend for almost a year and living together for two months. He loves her a lot but is getting annoyed because she uses the bathroom a lot. He mentions specific situations like driving for 2 hours without stopping, shopping, dinners, and even during movies or intimate moments. He's unsure if she actually needs to go or if she's doing it to annoy him. He's conflicted about bringing it up because he doesn't want to be the asshole.\n\nFirst, I should consider the girlfriend's health. The author says she's 20 and healthy, but frequent urination can be a symptom of medical issues like a UTI, diabetes, or overactive bladder. However, he hasn't mentioned her having any health problems. Maybe he hasn't considered that she might have an undiagnosed condition. But he says she's healthy, so maybe not.\n\nThen, the author's perspective. He's frustrated because these bathroom breaks are causing inconvenience. But does that make him the asshole? Well, he's trying to balance his feelings (loving her) with his annoyance. The question is whether his frustration is unreasonable.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. If he's not talking to her about it, maybe he's avoiding a necessary conversation. However, the way he's thinking about her possibly doing it on purpose could be a projection. He needs to approach her calmly, not accuse her of being annoying, but express his feelings and see if there's a solution.\n\nOn the other hand, if she's genuinely healthy, maybe there's a pattern he's not aware of. Maybe she's drinking a lot of fluids before going out. But he says she's healthy, so that might not be the case. However, his frustration is valid if it's affecting their time together. But is his annoyance justified enough to make him the asshole?\n\nIn terms of societal norms, people have different needs. If she's not doing it on purpose and it's just her body, then his annoyance might be misplaced. However, if it's causing significant disruption, he's allowed to feel that way. The key is how he handles it. If he doesn't communicate, he's not solving the problem. The fact that he's asking for advice suggests he's trying to handle it correctly, but the question is whether he's in the wrong now.\n\nThe answer options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). Considering that the author is aware she can't help it and is struggling with his feelings, he's not being malicious. However, not addressing the issue could be a problem. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong now. Since he hasn't acted on it yet and is seeking advice, maybe he's not the asshole. But if the answer hinges on the fact that his frustration is valid, then B. If it's about not considering her health or being inconsiderate, then A.\n\nHmm. I think the answer is B. He's not in the wrong for being annoyed, but he should communicate. The question is whether he's in the wrong for being annoyed, not for not talking to her. Since the situations he describes are real and causing inconvenience, and he's trying to understand, he's not the asshole. So answer B.\n"
