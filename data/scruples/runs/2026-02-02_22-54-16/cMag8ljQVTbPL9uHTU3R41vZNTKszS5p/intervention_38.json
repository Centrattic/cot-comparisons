Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they are the asshole for being annoyed by their girlfriend's frequent bathroom trips. They mention that she can't go more than two hours in the car without needing to stop, and that this happens during shopping, dinners, movies, and even during intimate times. The author feels inconvenienced and even suspects she might be doing it on purpose.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is 20 and healthy, so maybe there's an underlying health issue? But the author didn't mention that she's been to the doctor or that there's a medical reason. However, the author's frustration is real\u2014they're feeling like their plans are being disrupted repeatedly. \n\nOn one hand, it's reasonable to feel annoyed when your activities are constantly interrupted. People have different tolerances for inconvenience, and if this is affecting their quality time or causing stress, the author has a valid concern. On the other hand, maybe the author is not considering if there's a medical reason, or perhaps there's a way to manage it better. \n\nThe key points here are communication and empathy. The author hasn't approached the issue with their girlfriend yet, which is a problem. They should talk about it to understand her perspective. If she's healthy and it's just about habits, then maybe the author's annoyance is understandable. But without knowing the full story, it's hard to say. The author's assumption that she might be doing it to annoy them is a red flag\u2014it's not fair to assume malice without talking first. \n\nIf the girlfriend doesn't have a medical issue, then the author isn't wrong to feel annoyed. But they need to address it respectfully. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeling this way. Since the author hasn't communicated and is making assumptions, maybe they should have approached it differently. But feeling annoyed isn't inherently wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling annoyed, but they need to handle it better through communication. The problem isn't the feeling itself, but how they're dealing with it.\n"
