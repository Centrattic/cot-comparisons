Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about their girlfriend needing to use the bathroom frequently, causing them a lot of inconvenience. The author is annoyed and considering if they're being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The girlfriend is 20 and healthy. The author mentions that she goes to the bathroom a lot during activities like driving, shopping, dinners, and even during movies or intimate moments. The author is frustrated but also seems conflicted, feeling bad about being annoyed. They wonder if they're in the wrong for being bothered by this.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. In relationships, communication is key. The author hasn't mentioned the issue to their girlfriend yet, which is a problem. Without discussing it, they can't understand if there's an underlying medical issue or if it's something else. The girlfriend's health is important. Frequent urination can be a symptom of conditions like diabetes, UTIs, or stress. The author's assumption that she's healthy doesn't rule out these possibilities. \n\nThe author's annoyance is valid because it's affecting their quality time together. However, the wrong part would be if they're not considering the girlfriend's health or if they're making accusations without talking to her. The author's last line about suspecting she might be doing it to annoy him is a bit accusatory and could be hurtful if not discussed calmly. \n\nBut the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they haven't communicated with their partner and are making assumptions, they might be in the wrong for not addressing it first. Relationships require understanding, so the author should approach this with empathy and talk to their girlfriend before judging. So the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because they need to start a conversation instead of internalizing their frustration.\n"
