Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about the girlfriend going to the bathroom frequently, which is bothering him. He lists several situations where her bathroom breaks are inconvenient.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is overreacting. The girlfriend is young and healthy, so maybe she actually can't help it. Frequent urination can be a medical issue, but he says she's healthy. However, even if it's normal, the author is finding it annoying. The question is whether his annoyance is justified.\n\nHe mentions that they have to stop driving every two hours, shopping trips require bathroom breaks, and even during movies or intimate moments. The key points here are the impact on their activities and his emotional reaction. He feels the need to pause things and is considering if she's doing it on purpose. But he also admits he feels bad for being annoyed.\n\nNow, societal expectations: it's common for people to have bathroom needs, and partners should accommodate each other. But if it's excessive, maybe there's a valid concern. However, the author hasn't consulted a doctor for her or discussed it with her first, which might be a problem. He might be assuming she's faking it to annoy him, which is not a fair assumption without evidence.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author's annoyance is reasonable. If the frequency is genuinely causing significant disruption without a medical cause, then maybe it's a problem they should address together. But the author hasn't approached her about it yet; he's just venting on AITA. So, is he in the wrong for feeling this way? Or is he justified in wanting to discuss it if it's affecting their life?\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author might not be in the wrong for having these feelings, but he should approach her politely and without accusation. However, the question here is if he's in the wrong now, just for being annoyed. Since he hasn't acted on it yet and is seeking advice, maybe he's not in the wrong. But others might see his frustration as normal. Alternatively, if the bathroom breaks are normal, then his annoyance could be unwarranted.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the frequency is abnormal. If the girlfriend is healthy, then maybe the author is overreacting. But if it's affecting their life a lot, there's a valid concern. The author hasn't mentioned discussing with her, so maybe he's jumping to conclusions. However, he's not the one in the wrong just for being annoyed. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance. The key is that the author hasn't acted on it yet and is seeking advice, so he's not the asshole for feeling this way, but he should address it with her.\n"
