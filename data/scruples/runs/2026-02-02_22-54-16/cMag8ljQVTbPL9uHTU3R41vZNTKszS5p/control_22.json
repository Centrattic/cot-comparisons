Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy is annoyed because his girlfriend has to use the bathroom a lot. He lists all the situations where she needs to go, like during drives, shopping, after dinner, and even during movies or intimate moments. He's wondering if he's the asshole for being annoyed by this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the normalcy of bathroom breaks. People usually go pee a few times a day, but the frequency here seems excessive. The girlfriend is 20 and healthy, so maybe there's no medical reason? But wait, the author mentions she's perfectly healthy. So maybe she's just naturally going more than average. But is that something the author should be expected to tolerate?\n\nOn the other hand, the author is expressing frustration about the constant interruptions. Relationships require compromise, right? If he's feeling like his needs aren't being considered, is that valid? But is it unreasonable for him to be annoyed by something that's a natural bodily function?\n\nI should also think about the girlfriend's perspective. If she's healthy, she can't control when she needs to go. The author is suggesting she might be doing it to annoy him, which is a bit accusatory. That could be a problem because assuming bad intentions isn't fair. But if she's genuinely needing to go that often, maybe he's not considering her needs.\n\nAnother angle: communication. The author is considering not mentioning it, but maybe he should talk to her about it. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong now, not what he should do next. If he's already feeling this annoyance and is considering if it's okay to feel that, is it valid?\n\nAlso, the frequency mentioned here\u2014like stopping every two hours on a drive, multiple times during shopping, etc.\u2014might be more than typical. Maybe there's an underlying health issue even if she's considered healthy. But he states she's healthy, so maybe not. \n\nThe key points are: Is the author justified in his annoyance? Is it unreasonable to expect someone to accommodate their partner's bathroom needs? Or is it fair for him to be frustrated if these interruptions are affecting their activities?\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the frequency is abnormal and if the author is being overly critical. If she's healthy and there's no medical reason, then the author might be overreacting. But if the frequency is truly excessive, maybe there's a valid concern. However, since the author is the one feeling annoyed rather than the girlfriend having a medical issue, it might be his expectations that are the problem. So, he might be in the wrong for being annoyed at something that's natural and beyond her control.\n"
