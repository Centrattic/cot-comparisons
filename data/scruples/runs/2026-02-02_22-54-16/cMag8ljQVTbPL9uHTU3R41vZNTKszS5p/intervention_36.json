Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (person who posted the question) is in the wrong for being annoyed that their girlfriend uses the bathroom frequently. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend is 20 and healthy. They live together, and she goes to the bathroom often, causing inconveniences during activities like drives, shopping, dinner, and even during movies or intimate moments. The author feels annoyed but also doesn't want to accuse her without being sure if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are the frequency of bathroom breaks and the author's annoyance. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeling this way. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants confirmation.\n\nNow, considering possible angles. On one hand, the author's feelings are valid. It's normal to feel irritated by repeated inconveniences. However, it's important to consider if there's an underlying medical issue. The author mentions the girlfriend is healthy, but maybe there's something they haven't considered. Also, the author's tone might come off as dismissive if they don't approach the topic with empathy.\n\nBut the post says the author knows she can't help it. So maybe the author is just frustrated. However, the author should communicate their feelings without blaming her, perhaps discussing it to find a solution. But the question is about being in the wrong for feeling annoyed, not for how they handle it. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, people have different needs and it's a matter of finding a balance. But if the author's annoyance is due to something that's out of her control, maybe the author should adjust. However, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling annoyed, but might need to address it constructively. \n\nThe options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). The user thinks B. I think B as well because the author's feelings are valid, though they should handle the situation with care. The problem isn't the author's annoyance but how they address it. So the answer is B.\n"
