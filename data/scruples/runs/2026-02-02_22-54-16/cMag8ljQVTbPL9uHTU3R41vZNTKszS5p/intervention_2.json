Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for being annoyed that their girlfriend goes to the bathroom a lot. They mention she can't drive more than two hours without needing a stop, which is understandable if she's healthy. But the key here is that they're feeling inconvenienced multiple times in their daily activities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is being unreasonable. The girlfriend is 20 and healthy, so there's no medical issue mentioned. Frequent bathroom breaks can be normal, but when it's affecting their relationship activities, maybe there's an underlying issue. But the author is just expressing annoyance, not blaming or attacking her. They even say they love her and don't want to bring it up if they're wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author is overreacting. Everyone has different bathroom needs, and maybe she's just more sensitive. However, the author is trying to seek balance here. They're not saying she's doing it on purpose but are frustrated. The question is whether the annoyance is justified. \n\nI think the author is justified in feeling this way. It's about communication. The real problem might be that they haven't discussed it yet. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong. They need to talk to her about it respectfully, but they're not an asshole for feeling annoyed.\n"
