Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is annoyed because their girlfriend pees a lot, causing frequent bathroom breaks and inconveniences. They've been together a year and living together two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the girlfriend has any medical issues. The author mentions she's 20 and healthy, but maybe there's something they haven't considered. Maybe she does have a condition, like a UTI or diabetes, which increases urination. If she's healthy, then maybe it's just part of her normal habits. But the author is questioning their own annoyance.\n\nNext, the author's feelings. They feel guilty but are genuinely annoyed. It's important to acknowledge that feeling frustrated is normal, but how they handle it matters. The problem is the frequency of bathroom breaks affecting their activities. However, the key here is the approach. The author is contemplating whether to bring it up or not, which is good because they don't want to be an asshole. But the question is if they're in the wrong for being annoyed.\n\nSocial norms and relationships: In a healthy relationship, communication is key. The author isn't just being annoyed; they might be overreacting if the girlfriend's needs are legitimate. But if the frequency is truly excessive and affecting their quality time, it's reasonable to address it. However, the tone of the question suggests the author is more focused on their own inconvenience rather than checking if there's a valid reason.\n\nPossible assumptions: The author might be projecting their own habits. Maybe they don't need to go as often, so they judge hers. Also, the mention of pausing foreplay could be a sensitive point. It's important to approach this with empathy. The girlfriend might not be aware of how often she's stopping, or it could be a habit she's not thinking about. The author should talk to her, but in the wrong way, like blaming, could make them the asshole.\n\nBut the author is considering whether they are the asshole, which shows some self-awareness. If they confront her respectfully, it's not their fault for being annoyed. However, if they're being inconsiderate without discussing it, that's different. The answer hinges on whether the author's annoyance is justified and if they're addressing it the right way. Since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer would depend on the underlying causes and the approach. If the girlfriend is healthy and the author hasn't discussed it, maybe they are in the wrong for not understanding or accommodating. But if the author is being unreasonable, then they might not be. Wait, but the author is worried about being an asshole, so maybe they're not. But the act of being annoyed at someone's normal bodily functions could be seen as inconsiderate. Frequent urination can be a normal thing, especially if she's drinking a lot of fluids. The author might be overreacting. So, answer A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're annoyed at something that's a natural bodily function and should handle it with more empathy and communication instead of frustration.\n"
