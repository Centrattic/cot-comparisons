Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for being annoyed by their girlfriend's frequent bathroom trips. The author lists several situations where this happens, like during drives, shopping, dinner, and even during intimate moments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if there's a medical reason. The post says the girlfriend is 20 and healthy, so maybe it's just her normal frequency. But some people do go more often without an issue. However, the author is frustrated because it's causing inconvenience. The key question is whether the author's annoyance is justified.\n\nOn one hand, the author is expressing their feelings, which is valid. It's okay to feel annoyed if something is disrupting their life. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have her own reasons, like anxiety or a habit. But the author is not dismissing her health; they acknowledge she can't help it. However, the author is considering if it's their fault for being annoyed. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is being unreasonable. The situations described are frequent and varied, so it's not just a one-off thing. The author's feelings are valid because they're part of a partnership where mutual consideration is expected. But the girlfriend's actions might be a natural part of her body's function. The author should communicate their feelings without blaming her, maybe find a solution together. But being annoyed isn't inherently wrong. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
