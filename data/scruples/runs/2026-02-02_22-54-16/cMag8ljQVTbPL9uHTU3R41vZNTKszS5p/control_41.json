Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed by his girlfriend's frequent bathroom breaks.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a relationship with a 20-year-old girlfriend who's healthy. They've been together a year and living together two months. He mentions that she goes to the bathroom a lot, causing inconveniences: needing stops during drives, shopping trips, waiting after dinner, waking him up at night, pausing movies or even foreplay. He's considering if he's the asshole for being annoyed, but also wonders if she's doing it to annoy him.\n\nSo, the key points here are frequency of bathroom breaks and the impact on their activities. The author is feeling inconvenienced, but is this his fault? Well, everyone has different bathroom habits. However, if she's healthy, why so frequent? Maybe there's a medical issue? Or perhaps she's drinking a lot of fluids? The author hasn't approached her about it yet, which is important because he might be misunderstanding the situation. For example, maybe she's on medication or has a medical condition like diabetes or a UTI that causes frequent urination. Without knowing that, he's making assumptions.\n\nHe also mentions he's in love and feels bad for being annoyed. But he's frustrated. Now, the question is if he's in the wrong. If he hasn't communicated with her first, he can't know the real reason. Assuming she's healthy, maybe she's just naturally more frequent. But that's part of her body. Is it reasonable to expect her to control that? Or is he being overly accommodating? On the other hand, if her behavior is really affecting their quality time, maybe there's a balance needed. But without knowing why she's going so often, he's jumping to conclusions. Maybe she's trying to avoid something else, or it's just her norm. \n\nThe author's frustration is valid to some extent, but he's not considering her perspective. He's assuming she might be doing it on purpose, which is a big assumption. If he brings it up respectfully, maybe they can find a solution. But as of now, he's judging her without knowing the cause. So, is he the asshole? Well, being annoyed at someone's natural bodily functions is not uncommon, but if it's affecting their life, communication is key. Since he hasn't talked to her yet, it's hard to say he's in the wrong entirely. However, his frustration might be misplaced if there's a legitimate reason for her bathroom habits. Alternatively, maybe he's being inconsiderate by not understanding that people have different needs. \n\nIn relationships, partners need to be understanding of each other's needs. If he's not willing to accommodate her due to her natural habits, that's a problem. But if there's a pattern that's excessive and avoidable, maybe there's room for discussion. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether his annoyance is justified. If she's healthy and there's no medical reason, maybe his annoyance is a bit much. But if there's an underlying issue he's unaware of, then he's not at fault for being annoyed by something he doesn't know. However, the best approach is to talk about it, which he hasn't done yet.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No), because he's not in the wrong for feeling annoyed, but he should address it with her. However, if his annoyance is leading to judgment without understanding, he could be in the wrong. But since he hasn't communicated yet, maybe he's justified in his feelings. The community often reacts to these AITA posts by saying that the person isn't the asshole if they're trying to communicate and not being unreasonable. But here, the author hasn't communicated yet. So maybe the answer is B because he's not the asshole for being annoyed, but he should talk to her. Alternatively, if his behavior is to avoid her needs, then maybe A. However, the question is about being in the wrong for being annoyed. Since he's not controlling her or being abusive, just annoyed, it's more likely B.\n"
