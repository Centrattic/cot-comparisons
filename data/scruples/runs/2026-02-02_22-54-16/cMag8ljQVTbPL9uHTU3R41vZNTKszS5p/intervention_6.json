Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being annoyed by their girlfriend's frequent bathroom use. The situation details include how often she needs to go, which is causing inconvenience in various scenarios like driving, shopping, dining, and even during movies or intimate moments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's annoyance is justified. The girlfriend is described as healthy and only 20, so there's no medical issue indicated. However, the author is expressing frustration about the constant interruptions. But wait, is there a possibility that her frequent bathroom trips are genuine? The author mentions they can't go on a 2-hour drive without stopping, which is a long time for some people. However, two hours isn't extremely long, so maybe that's a red flag. Also, pausing foreplay to go to the bathroom seems odd if it's just normal frequency. \n\nOn the other hand, the author admits they feel bad for being annoyed. Maybe they're overreacting? If the girlfriend is actually healthy and not avoiding the issue, the author's annoyance might be unwarranted. But if she's making unnecessary stops, that's a problem. The key here is whether the author has evidence that she's faking it. The author isn't sure and is questioning if she's doing it to annoy them. That uncertainty complicates things. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author is considering not bringing it up because they might be the asshole. But avoiding the issue could lead to resentment. However, if the author brings it up without evidence, it might hurt the girlfriend unnecessarily. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed, not for not communicating yet. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, but frequent bathroom use is a normal bodily function. Unless there's a medical reason, the author might be overreacting. The situations described (like driving for two hours without stopping) don't sound extreme. So maybe the author is the asshole for being annoyed over something normal. But if the girlfriend isn't actually needing to go that often, then the author's frustration is valid. Since the author isn't sure, it's a bit of a toss-up. \n\nI think the key point is whether the author has communicated this to the girlfriend. Since they haven't, it's hard to say if they're in the wrong. But based on the information given, the author might be overreacting. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're annoyed over something that seems normal, without evidence of fakery. But if the girlfriend is genuinely not having an issue, the author's frustration is misplaced.\n"
