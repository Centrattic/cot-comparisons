Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a guy in a relationship with his girlfriend. They've been together almost a year and living together for two months. He loves her a lot but is getting really annoyed by how often she needs to use the bathroom. He lists several examples: during drives, shopping, dinner, at night, even during movies or foreplay. He feels bad for being annoyed but is struggling with it. He's wondering if he's the asshole for being upset about this. He doesn't want to mention it to her if he's the one at fault.\n\nFirst, I should consider the author's perspective. He's frustrated because the constant bathroom breaks are causing inconvenience. But is it reasonable? Well, maybe there's an underlying health issue. The author mentions she's 20 and healthy, but maybe there's something he's not considering. Frequent urination can be a symptom of diabetes, overactive bladder, or other issues. He hasn't mentioned discussing this with her or a doctor. So maybe he's jumping to conclusions.\n\nBut from his point of view, he's trying to be understanding. He acknowledges she can't help it, but the frequency is getting on his nerves. However, he's also suggesting she might be doing it to annoy him. That's a red flag. If he's questioning her motives, that could indicate a lack of trust and empathy. He's choosing to believe she's faking it instead of considering her health or communication issues.\n\nAlso, how has he approached this? He hasn't talked to her about it yet. He's only thinking about it and considering if he's in the wrong. Open communication is key in relationships. If he's been holding this in, that's a problem. Maybe she's experienced this issue for a while and hasn't found a solution, and he's not helping by not discussing it. Instead, he's letting frustration build up.\n\nBut the other side is, he's the one asking if he's the asshole. He's conflicted. He loves her, but the constant interruptions are affecting their lives. If she's truly healthy, maybe there's a habit or something they can work through together, like planning bathroom breaks or adjusting their schedules. But if he's already thinking she's doing it to annoy him, that's a toxic mindset. He's projecting his annoyance onto her instead of addressing it constructively.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, if he's not communicating his feelings respectfully and is instead letting this build up, that's a problem. Relationships require both partners to talk about issues. If he's angry about this without discussing it, that's not fair. On the other hand, if she's genuinely having health issues and he's not supportive, that's another issue. But the question is about him being in the wrong for being annoyed. If he's not inconsiderate and trying to work through it, maybe he's not the asshole. But the way he's thinking she might be faking it is definitely a problem. That shows a lack of trust and empathy, which is a key part of a healthy relationship.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is that the author is in the wrong. He needs to address the issue with his girlfriend first, maybe she has a medical reason, or they can find solutions together instead of being annoyed. His frustration is valid, but his approach\u2014holding it in and questioning her intentions\u2014is where he's at fault.\n"
