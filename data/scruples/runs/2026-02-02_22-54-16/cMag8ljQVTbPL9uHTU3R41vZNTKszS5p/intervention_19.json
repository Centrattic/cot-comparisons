Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed by their girlfriend's frequent bathroom breaks. So, the author lists several situations where the girlfriend needs to use the bathroom often, like during drives, shopping, after dinner, and even during movies or intimate moments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is 20 and healthy. The author mentions that she can't help it, so maybe there's a medical reason? But the author isn't sure and even suspects she might be doing it on purpose. However, he also says he loves her and doesn't want to accuse her.\n\nNow, the key question is whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed. The author is expressing frustration, but the problem is whether his annoyance is justified. On one hand, needing to use the bathroom frequently could be due to a medical issue, like a UTI, diabetes, or overactive bladder. If that's the case, the author's annoyance might be inappropriate because it's a health issue, not something she can control. On the other hand, if she's exaggerating or making unnecessary stops, the author might be right to be annoyed. However, the author hasn't consulted a doctor, so he's assuming she's healthy. The problem is that he's making assumptions about her intentions, thinking maybe she's doing it to annoy him, which could be a projection. \n\nAlso, communication is key in relationships. The author is considering not mentioning it, which could lead to resentment. But if he brings it up, he needs to approach it with empathy, not blame. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for feeling this way. Emotionally, it's human to be annoyed when plans are disrupted multiple times. But if the cause is genuine and beyond her control, the author's reaction might be seen as dismissive of her needs. The line between frustration and being unreasonable is thin here. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often have different bathroom needs. The author might not realize that frequent urination can be a symptom of something serious. But if she's healthy, maybe there's another reason. Still, the author's frustration is valid, but he needs to consider whether it's a medical issue before jumping to conclusions. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling annoyed, but he might be in the wrong if he's dismissing her real needs without understanding the cause. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong for being annoyed, and not for how he handles it, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). The annoyance itself isn't wrong, but the approach to addressing it is important.\n"
