Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for being annoyed by their girlfriend's frequent bathroom trips.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their girlfriend have been together a year, living together for two months. The main issue is that the girlfriend uses the bathroom very frequently, causing inconveniences in various situations like driving, shopping, dining, and even during intimate moments. The author loves her but is getting annoyed and is unsure if they're being unreasonable.\n\nI should consider both sides. The author's feelings of annoyance are real, but maybe there's an underlying medical issue they haven't considered. The girlfriend is 20 and healthy, but sometimes people might have conditions like a UTI, diabetes, or even just a small bladder. However, the author hasn't mentioned discussing this with her, so maybe they just assume she's fine. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's frustration is about the impact on their daily activities. It's normal to feel inconvenienced when plans are disrupted multiple times. But the key here is how to address it. The author is conflicted about bringing it up, worried about being an asshole.\n\nI need to think about healthy communication in relationships. If one person is experiencing something that's affecting their quality of life, it's reasonable to talk about it. However, the way it's approached matters. The author is annoyed but hasn't confronted her yet, which could be a problem if left unaddressed. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed, not for not communicating.\n\nThe answer might depend on whether the author's annoyance is justified. Since the girlfriend's behavior is causing consistent inconvenience, the author isn't necessarily wrong to feel that way. But the way they handle it is crucial. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach. \n\nAnother angle: is the author overreacting? If the girlfriend's bathroom trips are normal and the author is being unreasonable, then maybe the author is in the wrong. But if the frequency is excessive and causing real disruptions, the author's frustration is valid. Since the girlfriend is healthy, maybe it's just about adapting, but the author is struggling with that. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong for feeling annoyed. Everyone has different tolerances. However, it's important to approach the topic with empathy and understanding, considering if there's a medical reason. The author might need to have a conversation to address the issue without being accusatory. But in terms of being in the wrong for feeling annoyed, the answer is B (No).\n"
