I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's look at this situation. The person has a tattoo of a mentor's name, who was like a father figure and helped them get clean. Their fianc\u00e9 is now demanding they cover it up, even though they knew about the tattoo and didn't mind before. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for refusing.\n\nFirst, the tattoo was a tribute with significant personal meaning. The mentor was important in their recovery, and the relationship was platonic. The fianc\u00e9's sudden change of heart after previously accepting it is a key point. The author isn't the one violating the relationship by having the tattoo; the fianc\u00e9 is now imposing a condition that wasn't there before. The author has explained the reasoning, so it's not a secret. The fianc\u00e9's demand to remove or cover it seems to be about control or insecurity, not the tattoo's origin. Since the author didn't hide the tattoo and the fianc\u00e9 knew all along, the author isn't in the wrong. The issue is about the fianc\u00e9's current stance, not the author's past decision.\n"
