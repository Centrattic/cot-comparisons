I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for refusing to cover a tattoo of a mentor's name. The fianc\u00e9 is insisting they cover it before marriage.\n\nFirst, the tattoo is a tribute to a mentor who helped them get clean. The relationship was platonic, more like a father figure. The fianc\u00e9 supposedly knew about it and didn't mind initially. Now they're making it a dealbreaker. \n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author made the tattoo before the engagement, and the fianc\u00e9 was aware and okay with it. Now, the fianc\u00e9 is changing their stance. That could be a red flag about their commitment or trust issues. The author isn't obligated to change their body just because the fianc\u00e9 has a sudden issue. \n\nAlso, the tattoo is a meaningful tribute. Covering it would erase a part of their personal history. The fianc\u00e9's demand might be about control or insecurity rather than the tattoo itself. The author has the right to make decisions about their own body unless there's a mutual agreement they made before getting the tattoo. Since the fianc\u00e9 didn't have a problem before, it seems unfair to make this a condition now. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid reason for the tattoo and the fianc\u00e9's change of heart might be insincere.\n"
