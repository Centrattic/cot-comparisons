I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author has a tattoo of another man's name on their wrist, who was a mentor and like a father figure. They got it as a tribute after he passed away. Now their fianc\u00e9 wants them to cover it, and the author is upset because the fianc\u00e9 knew about it before and didn't mind. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The tattoo is of a mentor, not a romantic partner. The relationship was platonic and the man was important in their recovery and life. The fianc\u00e9 now has a problem with it, even though they said they understood before. The author is refusing to cover it, which is causing conflict.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, people have the right to their body choices, including tattoos. The author had a meaningful reason for getting it. The fianc\u00e9's sudden change in stance might be about their own insecurities or jealousy, not the tattoo's intent. The fact that the name is a tribute and the relationship was non-romantic seems important. The fianc\u00e9 should have respected that if they truly understood it before. \n\nHowever, relationships involve mutual respect and consideration. Maybe the fianc\u00e9 has valid feelings now, even if it was agreed upon earlier. But the author isn't wrong for standing by a tattoo that has personal significance. It's a question of whether the fianc\u00e9 is overstepping by pressuring to cover it, given the context. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't at fault for honoring someone who helped them. The fianc\u00e9's refusal to marry unless it's covered might be the issue here. So the answer is likely B, No. The author isn't in the wrong for having a meaningful tattoo and not wanting to cover it.\n"
