      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author has a tattoo of another man's name on their wrist. They explain that the man was a mentor, more like a father figure, who helped them get clean and passed away a few years ago. The tattoo is a tribute to both the mentor and their recovery. Now, the fianc\u00e9 is refusing to marry them unless they get the tattoo covered. The author is upset because the fianc\u00e9 knew about the tattoo beforehand and didn't seem to mind, but now it's an issue. They want to know if they're the asshole (AITA) for refusing to cover the tattoo.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The tattoo is a meaningful tribute to someone who had a significant, positive impact on the author's life. It's not related to a past romantic relationship or anything negative. The author mentions that the fianc\u00e9 was aware of the tattoo and initially understood. The sudden change in the fianc\u00e9's stance is confusing and seems to be the main point of contention.\n\nThe key points here are consent, understanding, and the nature of the relationship with the person whose name is tattooed. The author had the tattoo for a legitimate reason, and the fianc\u00e9's objection arises now, even after he supposedly understood it before. The author might feel that the tattoo is a personal choice and a symbol of their recovery and respect for their mentor. The fianc\u00e9's demand to cover it could be seen as an overreaction, especially since the original reasons for the tattoo are not negative or controversial.\n\nHowever, in relationships, it's possible that one partner might have insecurities or feelings that were not previously expressed. The author might need to consider if there's an underlying issue with the fianc\u00e9, like jealousy or a fear of commitment, even though the tattoo is not a romantic one. On the other hand, the author has the right to maintain their personal choices and symbols of their past unless it's causing harm or distress to their partner. Since the author has already explained the significance and the fianc\u00e9 initially accepted it, the sudden change might be the fianc\u00e9's problem, not the author's.\n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. The tattoo is a meaningful tribute, and the fianc\u00e9's objection comes after he was already aware of it. Unless the fianc\u00e9 has a valid, new reason that the author hasn't considered, like it being a trigger for their own issues, the author's stance seems reasonable. So the answer is B.\n"
