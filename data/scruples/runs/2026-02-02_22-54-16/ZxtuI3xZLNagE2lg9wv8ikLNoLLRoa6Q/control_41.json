I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The main issue is the fianc\u00e9 wanting the tattoo of another man's name covered, even though the author explains it's a tribute to a mentor and part of their recovery. \n\nFirst, the author got the tattoo as a tribute to a mentor who was like a father figure and helped them get clean. The fianc\u00e9 knew about it and didn't mind initially. Now, he's changing his mind and making it a deal-breaker for marriage. \n\nThe author argues that the tattoo is significant and has a meaningful backstory. The fianc\u00e9's sudden change of heart could be about control or insecurity, maybe feeling threatened by the presence of another man's name, even if it's platonic. \n\nThe author isn't in a relationship with the person whose name is tattooed, so there's no romantic history there. The fianc\u00e9's refusal seems more about his own feelings rather than the tattoo itself. The author isn't doing anything wrong by honoring someone who was important in their life. \n\nSo, the author isn't the one at fault here. The fianc\u00e9 is making a new demand that wasn't an issue before, which could be a sign of manipulation or insecurity. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
