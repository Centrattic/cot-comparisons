I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to cover a tattoo of a mentor's name. The fianc\u00e9 wants them to cover it before marriage, but the author feels it's absurd because the fianc\u00e9 knew about it beforehand and didn't mind. The tattoo is a tribute to a mentor who helped them recover and passed away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author explains the tattoo is for a platonic, father-like figure, not an ex or someone with romantic history. They've discussed this with their fianc\u00e9, who initially understood but now is making it a dealbreaker. The key points here are consent and mutual understanding in a relationship.\n\nIn relationships, both partners usually have expectations and boundaries. If the fianc\u00e9 knew about the tattoo before getting engaged, maybe he didn't consider it a problem at the time. Now, changing his stance might be about control or insecurity. The author's refusal isn't about being selfish but honoring someone important in their life. \n\nIs it fair for the fianc\u00e9 to demand a change now? That could be seen as a shift in priorities or a lack of respect for the author's personal history. The author isn't in the wrong for valuing their tribute. The fianc\u00e9 might need to reflect on why this is an issue now. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author isn't in the wrong). They have a valid reason, and the fianc\u00e9's sudden objection might stem from his own issues rather than the tattoo itself.\n"
