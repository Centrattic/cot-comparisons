I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation is that the author has a tattoo of a mentor's name, who was like a father figure and helped them get clean. Now, their fianc\u00e9 demands they cover the tattoo before marriage, which the author finds absurd because the fianc\u00e9 knew about the tattoo and didn't mind before. The author is upset that this is suddenly an issue.\n\nFirst, consider the author's perspective. The tattoo is a meaningful tribute to someone important in their life and their recovery. They've explained this to their fianc\u00e9, and initially, there was no problem. The sudden change in stance from the fianc\u00e9 suggests a shift in their priorities or insecurities. The author's refusal to cover it isn't about being difficult; it's about honoring a significant personal history and recovery journey.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's demand might stem from personal discomfort or a change of heart. While it's important to respect personal choices, the fianc\u00e9 is now imposing a condition that wasn't there before. However, the fianc\u00e9's stance could be about wanting to address any potential issues in their relationship, even if the tattoo itself isn't a direct issue. But given the explanation from the author, the tattoo has a deep, positive significance, so it's hard to see the author as being in the wrong here.\n\nThe key points are the tattoo's meaningfulness, the fianc\u00e9's prior knowledge and non-issue, and the sudden demand. The author isn't disrespecting someone from their past (since it's platonic and not a romantic figure) and is standing by their commitment to recovery. The fianc\u00e9's demand seems more about their own unresolved feelings or control rather than the author's wrongdoing. So, the author isn't in the wrong; the issue is more about the fianc\u00e9's current stance versus the author's justified attachment to the tattoo.\n"
