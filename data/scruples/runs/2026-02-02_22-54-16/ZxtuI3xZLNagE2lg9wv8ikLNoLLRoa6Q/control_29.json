The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author has a tattoo of a mentor's name on their wrist as a tribute. The mentor was a father figure who helped them get clean and passed away. The fianc\u00e9 wants the tattoo covered before marriage, but the author feels it's absurd, especially since the fianc\u00e9 knew about it beforehand and didn't mind.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The tattoo is a meaningful tribute to someone who played a significant role in the author's life and recovery. The author explains the relationship is strictly platonic, not a romantic or ex-boyfriend scenario. The fianc\u00e9 initially seemed okay with it but now is making it a deal-breaker. \n\nThe key points here are consent and the change in the fianc\u00e9's stance. The author had the tattoo before the engagement, and the fianc\u00e9 was aware and accepted it at the time. Now, the fianc\u00e9 is changing their position, which could be a red flag. The author is being asked to alter a part of their body that's a personal memorial, which might be seen as a violation of their autonomy. \n\nHowever, in relationships, partners sometimes have issues with past symbols. But since the tattoo wasn't of a romantic partner and was known from the start, the fianc\u00e9's sudden objection might be unreasonable. The author isn't doing anything wrong by holding onto a meaningful part of their history. The fianc\u00e9's demand could be more about control or insecurity rather than the tattoo itself. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid reason for the tattoo, and the fianc\u00e9's change of heart seems unfair. The answer should be B.\n"
