I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to cover a tattoo of a mentor's name. The author's fianc\u00e9 wants the tattoo covered before marriage. The key points here are the nature of the relationship with the mentor, the fianc\u00e9's initial reaction, and the current demand.\n\nFirst, the mentor was a father figure who helped the author get clean and passed away. The tattoo is a tribute, not a romantic or ex-partner. The author explains this to the fianc\u00e9, who initially seemed okay with it. Now, the fianc\u00e9 is making it a deal-breaker without a clear reason beyond knowing about it. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's change of heart isn't justified by any new information. The tattoo's origin is platonic and respectful. The author isn't in the wrong for valuing a meaningful tribute, especially since the fianc\u00e9 was aware and agreed before. The fianc\u00e9's sudden stance might be about control or insecurity, not the tattoo itself. So, the answer is B.\n"
