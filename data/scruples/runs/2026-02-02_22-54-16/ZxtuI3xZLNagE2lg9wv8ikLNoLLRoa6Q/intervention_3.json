I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author has a tattoo of a mentor's name, whom they consider like a father figure, and their fianc\u00e9 is insisting they cover it up before marriage. The author is arguing that the tattoo is a tribute to their recovery and the mentor who helped them, and the fianc\u00e9 only has an issue with it now even though he knew about it before and didn't mind.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author isn't wrong and is seeking confirmation.\n\nThe key points here are the nature of the tattoo. The author clarifies that the mentor wasn't a romantic interest or a negative influence. The relationship was platonic and positive, and the tattoo is a tribute to their recovery and the mentor's role in their life. The fianc\u00e9 initially understood but now is making an issue. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author isn't doing anything harmful. The tattoo is personal and meaningful. The fianc\u00e9's sudden change of heart might be about control or personal insecurity rather than the tattoo itself. The author has the right to keep a meaningful tattoo unless they mutually agreed otherwise. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's demand could be seen as inconsiderate, as they knew about the tattoo during the relationship but only raised it now as a condition for marriage. The author isn't wrong for wanting to keep a tribute to someone important in their life. There's no malicious intent or betrayal here. The decision to cover a tattoo is a personal choice, and the author is not obligated to change their body against their will unless it's a deal-breaker for the fianc\u00e9, which seems more about control than the tattoo itself.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The correct answer is B.\n"
