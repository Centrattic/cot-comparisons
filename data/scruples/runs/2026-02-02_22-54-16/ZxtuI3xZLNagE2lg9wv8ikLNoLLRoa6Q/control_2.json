I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to cover a tattoo of a mentor's name. The author's fianc\u00e9 wants them to cover it, but the author feels it's a tribute.\n\nFirst, consider the context of the tattoo. The name isn't of a romantic interest but a mentor who was like a father figure. The author explains it's a tribute to their recovery and the mentor's role in their life. The fianc\u00e9 knew about this and didn't mind initially but now has a problem with it. The author is upset because the fianc\u00e9 is changing his stance without a valid reason.\n\nThe key points here are the nature of the relationship with the mentor and the fianc\u00e9's sudden change of heart. The author has a valid emotional and personal reason for keeping the tattoo visible. The fianc\u00e9's demand to cover it seems to be a new issue, not something discussed before. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're standing by something meaningful to them. The fianc\u00e9 might be overstepping by making this a deal-breaker without understanding the significance. So, the author isn't in the wrong here because they're honoring someone important, and the fianc\u00e9's request is unreasonable given the circumstances.\n"
