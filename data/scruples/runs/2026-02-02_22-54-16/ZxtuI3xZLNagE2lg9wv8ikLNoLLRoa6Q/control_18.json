I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 refusing to marry unless the author covers up a tattoo of a mentor's name.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author has a tattoo of someone's name who was a mentor and father figure, helping them get clean. The fianc\u00e9 initially didn't mind but now is making it a condition. The author feels it's absurd and they've explained the significance.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the key points are the tattoo's meaning and the fianc\u00e9's change of heart. The author had the tattoo for recovery and tribute, and the fianc\u00e9 knew about it but didn't object before. Now, the fianc\u00e9 is making it a deal-breaker. The author might not be in the wrong because the tattoo is meaningful and the fianc\u00e9's sudden stance could be an ultimatum without valid reason. However, relationships involve compromise, so maybe there's a middle ground. But the author isn't wrong for holding onto something that's important to them, especially if it's part of their healing. The fianc\u00e9's demand might be unreasonable. So, likely answer B (No).\n"
