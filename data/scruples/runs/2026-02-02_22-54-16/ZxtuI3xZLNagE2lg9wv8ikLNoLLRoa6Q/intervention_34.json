I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to cover a tattoo of another man's name. The author's fianc\u00e9 wants them to cover it, but the author explains it's a mentor, like a father figure, who helped them get clean. They've already explained this to the fianc\u00e9, who was okay with it before but now it's a problem.\n\nHmm, so first, the tattoo isn't of a romantic or ex-partner, but a mentor. The author has a valid reason for having it as a tribute. The fianc\u00e9 knew about it and didn't mind initially. Now, suddenly it's a deal-breaker. That seems a bit contradictory. The author isn't doing anything wrong by keeping a memorial tattoo. The fianc\u00e9's change of heart might be their own issue, not the author's. The author is standing by their choice, which is their right. So, probably the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. But maybe some could argue about respecting the fianc\u00e9' feelings? But the author has already explained the significance, so it's more about the fianc\u00e9 not honoring their original acceptance. Yeah, I think B makes sense.\n"
