The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person has a tattoo of a mentor's name on their wrist. This mentor was like a father figure who helped them get clean and passed away. The fianc\u00e9 now wants them to cover the tattoo before marriage, which the author finds absurd because the fianc\u00e9 previously seemed okay with it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They had a meaningful reason for getting the tattoo\u2014it's a tribute to someone important in their life and their recovery journey. They've explained this to the fianc\u00e9, who initially understood. Now the fianc\u00e9 is making it a deal-breaker, which seems like a change of heart. The author feels this is unfair because the tattoo isn't from a romantic past but a platonic, father-like relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's position might be about personal discomfort or cultural/religious reasons regarding having another man's name tattooed. Some people might view it as a symbol that could cause jealousy or be a constant reminder of a past relationship, even if it's platonic. However, the author has clarified the context, so the fianc\u00e9's new stance might be based on personal insecurity or changing priorities. \n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual understanding in a relationship. The author got the tattoo before the engagement and explained its significance. If the fianc\u00e9 knew about it and was okay with it initially, then changing the mind later without a valid reason might be seen as unfair. The author isn't in the wrong for honoring their mentor, especially since the relationship was not romantic. \n\nHowever, relationships require compromise. If the fianc\u00e9 is now making this a non-negotiable issue, it's a matter of whether the author should accommodate this request. But since the tattoo was done with prior consent and the author has a legitimate reason, the fianc\u00e9's sudden objection might be more about his own feelings rather than the author's wrongdoing. \n\nSo, based on the information given, the author isn't in the wrong. The issue seems to stem from the fianc\u00e9's current discomfort rather than the author's actions. The answer is B.\n"
