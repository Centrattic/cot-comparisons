I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again. The person has a tattoo of a mentor's name who helped them get clean and acted like a father figure. Their fianc\u00e9 wants them to cover it up, and the author is asking if they're the asshole for refusing.\n\nFirst, the tattoo is a tribute to someone who was important in their life. The fianc\u00e9 knew about it beforehand and didn't mind, but now it's an issue. The relationship is supposed to be based on trust and understanding, right? If the fianc\u00e9 didn't have a problem with it initially, why is it a problem now? Maybe the fianc\u00e9 has changed their mind for personal reasons, but the author has valid reasons for keeping the tattoo.\n\nThe author isn't in a relationship with the mentor, so there's no romantic history there. The tattoo is a symbol of recovery and a positive influence. The fianc\u00e9 might be feeling insecure or maybe there's some other underlying issue. But the author isn't doing anything to harm the current relationship by keeping the tattoo. They've explained the significance, and the fianc\u00e9 agreed to the engagement knowing this. So the fianc\u00e9 is making a new demand that wasn't an issue before. That seems unfair. The author has a right to keep a meaningful tattoo unless there's a mutual agreement to remove it. So, probably the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
