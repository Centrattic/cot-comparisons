I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 refusing to marry unless the other person covers a tattoo of a mentor's name. The author is saying they think it's absurd because the fianc\u00e9 knew about the tattoo and didn't mind before, now it's a problem. The mentor was like a father figure who helped them get clean and passed away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author got the tattoo as a tribute to someone important in their life. The fianc\u00e9 initially understood but now is making it a deal-breaker. The key points are the history of the tattoo, the relationship with the mentor, and the sudden change in the fianc\u00e9's stance. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't hide the tattoo. They explained its significance. The fianc\u00e9 had prior knowledge and didn't object until now. The author's argument is about the change in the fianc\u00e9's position without a valid reason. The tattoo isn't of an ex or anything romantic, just a platonic, father-like figure. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9 might be feeling insecure or have new concerns, but if the author isn't disrespecting the mentor or hiding the tattoo, then the fianc\u00e9's demand seems unreasonable. The author isn't doing anything unethical; they're honoring someone who was important to their recovery. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the tattoo holds personal significance and the fianc\u00e9's sudden objection isn't justified. The author isn't obligated to remove a meaningful tribute just because the fianc\u00e9 changed his mind. The fianc\u00e9 should address his own feelings rather than making it a condition for marriage.\n"
