I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author has a tattoo of a mentor's name, a father figure who helped them get clean. Now, their fianc\u00e9 wants them to cover the tattoo before marriage. The author refuses and is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The tattoo is a tribute to a mentor, not a romantic partner, and that's been established. The fianc\u00e9 knew about it beforehand and didn't mind, but now it's a condition for marriage. The author feels this is unreasonable.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, a person has the right to their body. Unless there's a specific reason like a religious objection or a personal preference the author agreed to, the fianc\u00e9 can't force them to alter their tattoo. The fact that the tattoo has sentimental value adds to the argument against the author being in the wrong.\n\nHowever, relationships often involve compromises. The fianc\u00e9's request might stem from personal insecurities or cultural reasons. But the key point is that the author didn't agree to cover the tattoo when they got it, and the fianc\u00e9 changed his stance later. The author isn't obligated to change their body for someone else's comfort unless there's a mutual agreement they both entered into.\n\nAlso, the mentor's role as a father figure and the recovery aspect make the tattoo significant. The author has a valid emotional reason for keeping it. The fianc\u00e9's sudden change could be seen as an ultimatum without considering the author's feelings. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't in the wrong because they've maintained transparency about the tattoo's meaning. The fianc\u00e9's initial acceptance and subsequent change create the conflict. The author isn't violating any prior agreements, so their refusal isn't unjustified.\n"
