I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The person has a tattoo of a mentor's name on their wrist. This mentor was a father figure who helped them get clean and passed away. The fianc\u00e9 is now demanding that the tattoo be covered, even though he knew about it before and didn't mind. Now it's a problem, and he's using it as a condition for marriage.\n\nFirst, the tattoo is a tribute to someone who was important in the author's life. It's not a past boyfriend or anything romantic. The author explains the significance, and the fianc\u00e9 said he understood at the time. Now, the fianc\u00e9 is changing his stance. That seems a bit unfair. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to keep a meaningful tattoo. The fianc\u00e9 knew about it and didn't object before, so holding it over their head now might be the real issue here. The author has a valid reason for keeping the tattoo visible, so they shouldn't feel guilty about it. The fianc\u00e9's demand seems unreasonable, especially since the tattoo isn't related to a romantic relationship. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
