I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to cover a tattoo of another man's name. The author's fianc\u00e9 is demanding they cover it before marriage, even though they knew about it beforehand. The name is of a mentor who was like a father figure and helped the author get clean. The author has explained this, but the fianc\u00e9 is now making it a deal-breaker.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The tattoo is a tribute, not a romantic relationship. The fianc\u00e9 knew about it at the time and didn't object then. Now, they're changing their stance. That seems unfair. The author isn't doing anything wrong by honoring someone significant in their life. The fianc\u00e9's sudden objection might be about control or insecurity, not the tattoo itself. The author has a valid reason to keep the tattoo as a memorial. So, the answer is probably B, not in the wrong.\n"
