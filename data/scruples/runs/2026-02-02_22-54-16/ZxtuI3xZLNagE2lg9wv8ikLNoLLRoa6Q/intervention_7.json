The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting the other person to cover a tattoo of a mentor's name, which the author got as a tribute. The fianc\u00e9 is making it a condition for marriage, even though he knew about the tattoo before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's tattoo is of a mentor who was like a father figure, helped them get clean, and passed away. The relationship was strictly platonic. The fianc\u00e9 knew about it and didn't mind initially, now it's a problem. The author feels it's absurd to have to cover it. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's stance: Is it reasonable to ask for the tattoo to be covered? Maybe he's uncomfortable with the reminder of the past relationship, or maybe values something the author has, like permanence of the mentor's memory. But since the author explained the significance, the fianc\u00e9's change of heart might be about control or insecurity, not the tattoo itself.\n\nThe author's right: They have a right to keep their tribute. The tattoo was a meaningful symbol, and the fianc\u00e9's current objection might not be valid, especially if he knew about it and accepted it before. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to honor their mentor. The fianc\u00e9's demand could be a new condition, which might be unfair. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong. The tattoo has personal significance, and the fianc\u00e9's new requirement might be about his own issues, not the actual tattoo's meaning. The author's choice to keep it is valid.\n"
