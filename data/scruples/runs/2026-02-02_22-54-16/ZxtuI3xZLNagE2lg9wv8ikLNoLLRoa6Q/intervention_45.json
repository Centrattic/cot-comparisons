I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for refusing to cover a tattoo of a mentor's name. Their fianc\u00e9 demands it, but the person argues the tattoo is a tribute to a father figure who helped them get clean.\n\nFirst, the tattoo's significance. The name isn't a boyfriend or ex\u2014it's a mentor who passed away. The relationship was platonic, so there's no romantic connection. The person had this tattoo for a meaningful reason, as a tribute. That seems valid. \n\nThen, the fianc\u00e9's stance. The person says the fianc\u00e9 knew about the tattoo and didn't mind at first. Now it's a sudden issue. That's a red flag. If the fianc\u00e9 didn't have a problem initially, but now is making it a deal-breaker, that might be controlling. The person isn't in the wrong for holding onto something meaningful. \n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9's request seems to be more about control or insecurity rather than the tattoo itself. The author isn't doing anything harmful; they're honoring someone important. The fianc\u00e9 should respect that unless there's a valid, mutual reason. Since the tattoo predates the relationship and was explained, the author shouldn't be forced to change it. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong.\n"
