I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to cover a tattoo of another man's name. The situation is that the author's fianc\u00e9 wants them to cover it up, but the author explains that the man was a mentor, like a father figure, who helped them get clean and passed away. The fianc\u00e9 knew about the tattoo before and didn't mind, but now it's a problem.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the nature of the relationship with the man whose name is tattooed. The author clarifies it's not a past boyfriend, just a platonic, father-like figure. They got the tattoo as a tribute to his help with recovery. The fianc\u00e9 knew about it and previously didn't have an issue. Now, the fianc\u00e9 is making it a condition for marriage. \n\nSo, the author is standing by their decision because of the emotional and personal significance. The fianc\u00e9 changed their stance. Is the author wrong for not complying? Well, the tattoo is a personal choice and holds meaning. The fianc\u00e9's demand comes up later, which might be a red flag. The author is being consistent in their stance, explaining the importance, so they're justified in not wanting to cover it. The fianc\u00e9 might be overstepping by making that a deal-breaker now. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
