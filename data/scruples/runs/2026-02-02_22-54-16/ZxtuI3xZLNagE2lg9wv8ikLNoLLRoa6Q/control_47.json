I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 wants the author to cover up a tattoo of another man's name. The author says the man was a mentor, like a father figure, and the tattoo is a tribute to him and their recovery. The fianc\u00e9 knew about it before and didn't mind, but now it's a problem.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author got the tattoo as a meaningful tribute, which is a personal choice. The fianc\u00e9 is now making it a condition for marriage, which seems like a red flag. The fact that he changed his stance after previously not being an issue might indicate that his new demand is more about control or insecurity rather than the tattoo itself. \n\nThe author has already explained the significance, and the fianc\u00e9 initially understood. Now, changing the stance without valid reason could be manipulative. The tattoo is a part of the author's identity and history. Forcing someone to alter their body against their will for marriage is a big deal. Also, the tattoo's context is platonic and positive, not involving a past romantic relationship, which might be a common concern in such situations. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for refusing. Since the tattoo has personal, positive significance and the fianc\u00e9's demand seems to come out of nowhere after initial acceptance, the author isn't in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9 is making unreasonable demands. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
