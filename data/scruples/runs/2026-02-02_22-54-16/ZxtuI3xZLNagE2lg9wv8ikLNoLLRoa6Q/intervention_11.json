I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to cover a tattoo of a mentor's name. The fianc\u00e9 wants the tattoo covered before marriage.\n\nFirst, the author explains the tattoo's significance: a mentor who was like a father, helped them get clean, and passed away. The relationship was platonic. The fianc\u00e9 knew about it before and didn't mind, but now it's a problem. The author thinks it's absurd because the backstory was shared.\n\nSo, the main points are: the tattoo is a memorial and a personal symbol of recovery. The fianc\u00e9 had prior knowledge and accepted it, but now is making it a dealbreaker. The author is conflicted because they feel it's a meaningful part of their identity.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, people have the right to make choices about their bodies, especially when the tattoo has deep personal meaning. The fianc\u00e9's sudden change of heart might be about control or insecurity rather than the tattoo itself. The author isn't in a relationship with the mentor, so the tattoo isn't about a past romantic connection. The fianc\u00e9's refusal to accept it despite prior knowledge could be unreasonable. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're holding on to something important, and the fianc\u00e9 is making an ultimatum without valid reason. Answer B.\n"
