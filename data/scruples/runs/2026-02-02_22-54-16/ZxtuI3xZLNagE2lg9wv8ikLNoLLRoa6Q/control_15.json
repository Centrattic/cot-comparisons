I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to cover a tattoo of a mentor's name. The fianc\u00e9 wants the tattoo covered before marriage.\n\nFirst, the tattoo is of a mentor who helped the author get clean, not an ex or anything romantic. The author explained the significance, and the fianc\u00e9 said he understood at first. Now he's changing his mind. The author feels it's absurd because there's no romantic history here.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The options are A or B. So, I need to decide if the author is in the wrong. \n\nWell, the author has a valid reason for the tattoo, and the fianc\u00e9 is now making a demand despite knowing the backstory. The author isn't doing anything unethical by keeping the tribute. The fianc\u00e9 is the one changing his stance without a good reason. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
