I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 refusing to marry unless the other person covers up a tattoo of a mentor's name. The author explains that the tattoo is a tribute to their recovery and the mentor, who was like a father figure and helped them get clean. They mentioned that the fianc\u00e9 initially understood but now is making it a deal-breaker.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The tattoo is a tribute to someone significant in the author's life, and the fianc\u00e9 knew about it beforehand. The author isn't hiding a past relationship but honoring a platonic, father-like figure. The fianc\u00e9's sudden change of heart might stem from insecurity or changing priorities. \n\nIs the author wrong for not covering the tattoo? Well, the author had the tattoo for a meaningful reason and communicated its significance. The fianc\u00e9's refusal seems more about his own feelings or expectations rather than the tattoo itself. The author isn't obligated to alter their body based on someone else's comfort, especially if it was agreed upon before. However, relationships involve compromise, but this could be a deal-breaker if the fianc\u00e9 can't accept it. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author explained the tattoo's meaning and the fianc\u00e9 initially accepted it, expecting the author to cover it now without valid reasoning might be unfair. The author isn't in the wrong for standing by their choice, especially since the tattoo has personal significance and the fianc\u00e9's current stance seems inconsistent. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
