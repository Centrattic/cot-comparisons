I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is that the author has a tattoo of another man's name on their wrist. This man wasn't a boyfriend or anything romantic; he was a mentor and father figure who helped the author get clean. The fianc\u00e9 is now refusing to marry them unless they cover the tattoo. The author is upset because the fianc\u00e9 knew about it before and didn't mind, but now it's an issue.\n\nFirst, I should consider the author's perspective. The tattoo is a meaningful tribute to someone important in their life. The author has explained the reasons behind it, and the fianc\u00e9 initially understood. Now, suddenly, it's a deal-breaker. That seems like a change of heart, which might not be fair. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to honor someone who helped them through a tough time.\n\nThen there's the fianc\u00e9's perspective. Maybe they're uncomfortable with the tattoo for some reason now. But the key point here is that they knew about it beforehand and agreed to it. If they only have an issue now, that could be seen as hypocritical or being selective about their objections. The author isn't doing anything unethical or harmful by keeping the tattoo. It's a personal choice and a symbol of their recovery and gratitude.\n\nAlso, tattoos can be personal and meaningful. The fianc\u00e9's demand to cover it might be about control or not respecting the author's past. The author isn't obligated to remove something that's important to them. So, the fianc\u00e9's stance might be the problem here, not the author's decision to keep the tattoo. The author isn't in the wrong for standing by their choice, especially since they've made their reasons clear.\n"
