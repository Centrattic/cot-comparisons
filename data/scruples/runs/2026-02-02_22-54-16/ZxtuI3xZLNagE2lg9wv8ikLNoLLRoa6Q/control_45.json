I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that they have a tattoo of a mentor's name on their wrist, which was a tribute to him and their recovery. The fianc\u00e9 now wants them to cover it up to marry him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author explains that the tattoo is of a mentor who was like a father figure, not a romantic partner. They got the tattoo as a tribute, and the fianc\u00e9 initially seemed okay with it. Now, the fianc\u00e9 is making it a deal-breaker. The key points here are the nature of the tattoo, the relationship with the mentor, and the fianc\u00e9's sudden change in stance.\n\nThe author isn't in a wrong here because the tattoo was given with a meaningful reason, and they were upfront about it. The fianc\u00e9 knew about it beforehand and didn't object until later. This could be a case of the fianc\u00e9 changing his mind for reasons that might be about control or insecurity rather than the tattoo itself. The author has the right to keep a meaningful tattoo unless they mutually agreed to remove it, which they didn't. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
