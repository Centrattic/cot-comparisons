I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 wants the author to get a tattoo of another man's name covered, but the author refuses. The name is of a mentor who helped them get clean and passed away. The fianc\u00e9 initially didn't mind but now is making it a problem.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author explains the tattoo's significance\u2014it's a tribute to a mentor, not an ex or someone with a romantic past. They got the tattoo after the mentor's death, and the fianc\u00e9 knew about it before. Now, the fianc\u00e9 is changing their stance, requiring the cover-up as a condition for marriage.\n\nThe key points here are consent and the change in the fianc\u00e9's position. The author didn't hide the tattoo; in fact, they explained its meaning. The fianc\u00e9 initially accepted it but is now making it an issue. The author might feel this is unfair, especially since the tattoo has personal significance. The fianc\u00e9's sudden objection could stem from jealousy or insecurity, even though the relationship was platonic. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the author has every right to have a tattoo that's meaningful to them. The fianc\u00e9's demand seems to be about control or insecurity, not the author's fault. The author isn't hiding the tattoo's history. They've been transparent. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9 is overstepping by making this a deal-breaker now, especially after previously accepting it.\n"
