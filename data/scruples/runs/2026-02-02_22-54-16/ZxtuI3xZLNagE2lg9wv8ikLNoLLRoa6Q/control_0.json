I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to cover a tattoo of a mentor's name. The fianc\u00e9 wants them to cover it before marriage. The author explains that the tattoo is a tribute to a mentor who helped them get clean and acted as a father figure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author says the fianc\u00e9 knew about the tattoo and didn't mind initially. Now, he's making it a condition for marriage. The tattoo isn't of a past romantic interest but a platonic, father-like figure. The author has explained the significance, but the fianc\u00e9 is now objecting.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respect. The author got the tattoo with the understanding that the fianc\u00e9 was okay with it. Now changing the stance could be seen as a breach of trust. The author has a valid emotional reason for keeping the tattoo visible. The fianc\u00e9's demand seems to be about control or insecurity, not the author's wrongdoing.\n\nAlso, tattoos are personal choices. Unless there's a cultural or religious reason the fianc\u00e9 has, it's hard to see why covering it is necessary. The author isn't in the wrong for honoring someone who helped them. The fianc\u00e9's sudden objection might indicate he hasn't fully considered the importance of the tattoo to the author. Therefore, the author isn't at fault here.\n"
