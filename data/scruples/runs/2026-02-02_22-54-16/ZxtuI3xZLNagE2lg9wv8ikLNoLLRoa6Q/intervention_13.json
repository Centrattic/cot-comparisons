I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for refusing to cover a tattoo of another man's name. The author's fianc\u00e9 wants them to cover it, but the author explains that the name is of a mentor who helped them get clean and passed away. The relationship was platonic, more like a father figure. The fianc\u00e9 knew about it initially but now it's an issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a tattoo that's a tribute to someone important in their life. The fianc\u00e9 is now making it a deal-breaker unless it's covered. The author feels wronged because the fianc\u00e9 previously understood the significance. \n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual understanding in the relationship. The author didn't hide the tattoo; they explained it, and the fianc\u00e9 accepted it at first. Now, the fianc\u00e9 is changing their stance, which could be about control or insecurity. The author isn't doing anything wrong by honoring their mentor. \n\nAlso, tattoos are a personal choice. Unless there's a specific reason related to the relationship, like the name being a past lover, but here it's a father figure. The fianc\u00e9's demand might stem from jealousy or a need for control. The author isn't obligated to alter their body for someone else's comfort. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B\u2014the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid reason for the tattoo, and the fianc\u00e9's change of heart is the issue here.\n"
