I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for refusing to cover a tattoo of a mentor's name. The fianc\u00e9 wants the tattoo covered before marriage.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The tattoo is of a mentor who was like a father figure, helped the author get clean, and passed away. The author got the tattoo as a tribute. The fianc\u00e9 knew about it and seemed okay at first but now it's an issue. The author thinks it's absurd because the relationship was platonic, not a past boyfriend.\n\nSo, the author's stance is that the tattoo is meaningful and they shouldn't have to cover it. The fianc\u00e9's stance is that he wants it covered, possibly for personal reasons now. \n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The question is about moral responsibility. The author isn't doing anything harmful by keeping the tattoo. They have a valid reason for getting it, and they've explained it. The fianc\u00e9 is changing his stance after initially being fine with it. \n\nThe author isn't violating any rights; they have the right to their body and the tattoos they choose. The fianc\u00e9's demand seems to be about his own feelings now, but the author isn't obligated to change their body for someone else's comfort unless there's a mutual agreement. Since the fianc\u00e9 knew about it before and didn't object, making it a pre-marriage condition now could be seen as unfair. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to their tattoo, and the fianc\u00e9's request is unreasonable given the circumstances. The answer should be B.\n"
