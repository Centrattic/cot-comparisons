I think this is absolutely absurd because he knew full well all about it and didn't seem to mind, now it's a problem? No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for refusing to cover a tattoo of a mentor's name. Their fianc\u00e9 wants them to get it covered before marriage.\n\nFirst, the tattoo isn't of a boyfriend or ex. It's a mentor who helped them get clean and passed away. They explain the significance\u2014platonic, father-like figure. The fianc\u00e9 knew about it before and didn't mind, but now it's an issue.\n\nThe key points here are the reasons behind the tattoo and the fianc\u00e9's change of heart. The person has a valid reason for the tattoo, and the fianc\u00e9's sudden objection after previously being okay with it might be the problem. The person isn't doing anything unethical by keeping the tribute. The fianc\u00e9's demand could be about control or insecurity, not the tattoo itself. So the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
