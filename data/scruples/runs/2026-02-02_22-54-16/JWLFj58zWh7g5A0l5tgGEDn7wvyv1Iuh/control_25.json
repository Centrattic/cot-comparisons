I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person asking the question) is in the wrong in their situation. The main issue is about the boyfriend's behavior during a toilet clog incident.\n\nSo, the boyfriend was supposed to help unclog the toilet. He tried for an hour, then the author tried for two more hours. When the author's dad came to help, the boyfriend was just lying down and didn't assist. The dad got angry because he felt the boyfriend wasn't helping, even though the author's dad ended up doing all the work. The boyfriend later claimed that the situation wasn't urgent and that he didn't need to help because he disagreed with how the dad was fixing it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. When someone helps you with something, especially a favor that's unpleasant like fixing a toilet, it's expected that the person receiving the help shows gratitude and maybe offers assistance. The boyfriend didn't help, even when the problem was causing them to not have a functioning bathroom. That seems like poor behavior.\n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning is that he let the author's dad fix it, implying that's enough. But allowing someone to help isn't the same as contributing. Also, the boyfriend's dad was supposed to help, but he didn't do anything, which is why the author's dad needed to come. The boyfriend's attitude of not helping and being ungrateful is the main issue here.\n\nThe author is upset because they expected some level of courtesy and participation from the boyfriend, which is a reasonable expectation. The boyfriend's claim that he did nothing wrong seems to ignore the social expectation of mutual support and gratitude in a relationship. \n\nSo, the boyfriend is likely the one in the wrong here. The author isn't at fault for expecting her partner to be helpful and respectful towards her family when they come to assist. The boyfriend's lack of action and his dismissive attitude toward the situation's urgency are problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
