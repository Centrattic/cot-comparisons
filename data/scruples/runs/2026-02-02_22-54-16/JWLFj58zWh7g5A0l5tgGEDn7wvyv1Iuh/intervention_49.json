I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves a boyfriend who didn't help when a toilet was clogged and then acted dismissively when the author's dad had to fix it. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The toilet was clogged after the boyfriend had stomach issues. They tried various methods to unclog it. The boyfriend tried for an hour, then the author tried for two more hours. Eventually, they called the author's dad. The dad took three hours, did most of the work, and when he asked for a shower and clean clothes, the boyfriend was upset. The dad was angry, and the author is upset with the boyfriend's attitude.\n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning is that the situation wasn't urgent and he didn't have to help. The author feels the boyfriend should have been more helpful and courteous to her dad. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nLooking at the situation, the main issues are about responsibility in a household problem and showing respect to a family member who helped. In a shared living situation, both partners should contribute. The boyfriend did try for an hour, but the problem persisted. However, when the author's dad came, the boyfriend didn't help, just laid down. This could be seen as not pulling his weight, especially since the dad did most of the work. \n\nThe boyfriend's attitude of being dismissive and not showing gratitude for the help might be the main point here. The author's expectation of common courtesy is reasonable. It's normal to expect that someone who's being helped by a family member would show some appreciation or at least not be uncooperative. \n\nThere could be arguments about the boyfriend's stress or disagreement with the dad's methods, but even then, being unhelpful and dismissive isn't acceptable. The situation shows a lack of teamwork and respect from the boyfriend's side. The author isn't wrong in feeling that the boyfriend should have contributed more and shown more gratitude. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). The boyfriend's actions and attitude seem to be the main issues here.\n"
