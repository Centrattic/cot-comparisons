I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person posting the story) is in the wrong based on the situation described. The situation involves a clogged toilet and the boyfriend's reaction to the author's dad helping fix it.\n\nFirst, the toilet was clogged for a couple of days. The boyfriend tried for an hour, then the author tried for two hours. They bought an auger, but it didn't work. Then they called the author's dad. When the dad arrived, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't help. The dad worked for three hours, the author helped clean up. Afterward, the dad was upset because the boyfriend didn't assist and even seemed annoyed. The boyfriend claims the author should be grateful he allowed the dad to help, and that he didn't think it was that urgent. He also said he disagreed with the dad's method.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the boyfriend didn't help, was ungrateful, and even criticized the dad's approach. The author feels this is inconsiderate, especially since their apartment is small and they had no other bathroom. The boyfriend's response is dismissive and lacking in appreciation for the help provided.\n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone helps you, especially with something as unpleasant as a clogged toilet, it's expected to show gratitude and offer assistance. Lying down and doing nothing while someone else is working hard, especially in a stressful situation, is seen as inconsiderate. The boyfriend's attitude of not helping and even being critical could be viewed as rude.\n\nThe author isn't asking for validation just for the sake of feeling right; they're trying to understand if their expectations are unreasonable. The boyfriend's behavior doesn't align with common courtesies in such situations. Therefore, the author is likely not in the wrong here. The boyfriend's actions and attitude are the main issues. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
