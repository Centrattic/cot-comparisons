I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out who's in the wrong here. The user wants to know if the author (the person who posted the story) is at fault. The situation is about their boyfriend's behavior during a toilet clog emergency.\n\nFirst, let's break down the scenario. The toilet was clogged, which is a big issue, especially in a small apartment with no other bathroom. The boyfriend tried for an hour, then the author tried for two hours. They bought an auger tool. The boyfriend was annoyed when buying the tool. Then, when the author's dad came to help, the boyfriend was lying down the whole time while the dad worked for three hours. The boyfriend didn't help and even criticized the method. After the dad finished, the boyfriend was upset when the dad needed clean clothes. \n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning is that he didn't have to help, and he was okay with the dad helping. The author and her dad feel he should have been more grateful and helpful. \n\nNow, considering social norms, when someone does a favor, especially a significant and unpleasant one like fixing a toilet clog, the expectation is gratitude and possibly some assistance. The boyfriend didn't help, didn't engage, and was dismissive. That seems inconsiderate. The author's dad was angry, which suggests the boyfriend's actions were seen as disrespectful. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument that it wasn't urgent is weak because the toilet had been clogged for days, leading to a pool of waste. The author was actively trying to fix it. So the situation was definitely urgent. \n\nThe boyfriend's refusal to help and his attitude could be seen as disrespectful towards both the author and her dad. The author isn't asking for validation just for the sake of it; she's seeking understanding about whether her expectations are reasonable. \n\nIn most social contexts, people are expected to contribute or at least show appreciation when someone helps them, especially in a physically demanding and unpleasant task. The boyfriend's behavior doesn't meet that standard. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
