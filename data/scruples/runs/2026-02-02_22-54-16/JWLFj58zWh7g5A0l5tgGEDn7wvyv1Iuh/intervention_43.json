I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for being upset with their boyfriend's behavior during a toilet clog emergency. \n\nFirst, the context: The toilet was clogged, they tried fixing it themselves, then the author's dad came over to help. The boyfriend was lying down the whole time while the dad worked, and later got upset when the dad asked for clean clothes because his were soiled.\n\nThe author feels the boyfriend should be grateful, but he's acting like it's no big deal and even criticized the dad's method. The boyfriend's reasoning is that the author should be thankful he allowed the dad to help and that he didn't do anything because he disagreed with the approach.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about respect and gratitude. When someone does a favor, especially a messy and time-consuming one like fixing a toilet, it's customary to show appreciation. The boyfriend's lack of action (lying down) and his dismissive attitude towards the effort might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nThe author's dad was there for three hours, dealing with the mess, and the boyfriend's nonchalance could come off as disrespectful. Even if he disagreed with the method, he could have at least shown some gratitude for the help. The author is upset because they expected basic courtesy from their partner, which seems reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend was stressed or overwhelmed? But lying down during a situation where help was needed and showing no effort to assist might not reflect well on him. The author isn't the one who called for help; they had to involve their dad because their own efforts failed. The boyfriend's refusal to participate, despite the urgency (no other bathroom in a small apartment), adds to the problem.\n\nThe dad was angry, and the author feels validated. The boyfriend's argument that it wasn't urgent or a big deal seems out of touch with the reality of the situation. The author isn't wrong to expect some level of respect and appreciation from their partner, especially when the dad did all the work. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's expectations are reasonable. The boyfriend's actions (or lack thereof) were inconsiderate, and the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The answer should be B.\n"
