I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a toilet clogged after the boyfriend had stomach issues. The author tried to fix it, then they bought an auger. He tried for an hour, then she tried for two hours. Then she calls her dad because things weren't working. When the dad arrives, the boyfriend is lying down and doesn't help. The dad fixes it in three hours while the boyfriend does nothing. The dad gets angry because the boyfriend didn't pitch in, and now the dad is upset, and the author is confused about her boyfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both perspectives. The author's side: she's dealing with a toilet that's not working, which is a big problem, especially in a small apartment with no other bathroom. She's frustrated and asks for help, which her dad provides. The boyfriend, on the other hand, claims that he didn't do anything wrong, saying that he let her dad fix it and that he didn't want things to go wrong. He also says it wasn't urgent and that he disagreed with how her dad was fixing it. \n\nThe key points here are about responsibility and social etiquette. When someone comes to help, especially a family member, it's generally expected that the host (in this case, the boyfriend) would at least be polite, offer assistance, or show gratitude. Lying down and doing nothing when a guest is dealing with such a messy situation might come off as disrespectful or ungrateful. \n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning that he should be thanked for letting the dad fix it seems out of touch. The dad isn't just \"letting\" them fix the toilet; he's doing the actual work. The boyfriend's lack of help and dismissive attitude likely contributed to the dad's anger. The author's expectation of common courtesy seems reasonable. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the boyfriend was stressed or had a different approach, but even then, he could have at least been present and helpful. Disagreeing with the method shouldn't be a justification for not contributing. Also, the boyfriend's comment about disagreeing with how the dad fixed it\u2014if that's true, he could have communicated that, but instead he did nothing. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common to assist when a family member is doing a favor, unless there's a valid reason. The boyfriend's behavior might be seen as inconsiderate, not just by the author but by the dad. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset about this. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions and attitude are the main issues here. The answer should be B.\n"
