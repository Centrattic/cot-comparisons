I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The situation is about a couple dealing with a clogged toilet. The boyfriend was lying down while the author and her dad fixed it. The author is upset because her boyfriend didn't help and was uncooperative, even when her dad came over.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The toilet was clogged for a couple of days, they bought a tool, the boyfriend tried for an hour but then wanted to give up. The author tried for two more hours. Then they called the author's dad. When the dad came, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't help. The dad fixed it in three hours while the author helped. The boyfriend didn't offer help, was ungrateful when the dad asked for shorts, and made excuses. The author feels the boyfriend should be grateful, but he thinks she should be thankful he didn't make a bigger deal.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author in the wrong? The user thinks she's not. Let me consider both sides. \n\nThe author's perspective: She and her dad worked hard to fix the toilet, which was a big problem in a small apartment. The boyfriend didn't contribute, was unhelpful, and ungrateful. She expects basic courtesy and help from her partner, especially in a crisis.\n\nThe boyfriend's perspective: He tried for an hour, then the author took over. He didn't help when the dad was there, maybe because he disagreed with the method or felt it wasn't urgent. He thinks he's being reasonable by not forcing himself to help.\n\nCommon courtesy would suggest that when someone helps you, especially in a difficult situation, you should be grateful and offer assistance. The boyfriend didn't do that. Also, in a shared living situation, especially when it's a major issue like a non-working toilet, both partners should contribute. The boyfriend's refusal to help, even when the problem was severe, seems like a failure to support the relationship. \n\nThe dad went out of his way to help, and the boyfriend's lack of cooperation could strain the relationship further. The fact that the dad is angry makes sense because people usually expect some level of respect and gratitude. The boyfriend's reasoning that it wasn't urgent or that he disagreed with the method is not a valid excuse for not helping at all. In a small apartment without another bathroom, it's a critical issue. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior was inconsiderate and unhelpful. The answer should be B.\n"
