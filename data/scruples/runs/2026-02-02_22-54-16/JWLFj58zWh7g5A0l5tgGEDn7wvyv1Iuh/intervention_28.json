I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a clogged toilet that both the author and her boyfriend tried to fix. When they called the author's dad for help, the boyfriend was laying down and didn't assist, which upset both the author and her dad.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The boyfriend didn't help during the repair, even though it was a significant problem. The author tried for hours, and the dad had to come over and work for three hours, dealing with a messy situation. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he let the dad fix it and didn't see it as urgent. He also supposedly disagreed with how the dad was fixing it, but that's not clear.\n\nThe main issue here seems to be about expected behavior in a partnership and respect towards family members. The boyfriend didn't contribute during a stressful situation, which could be seen as inconsiderate. The author expected some level of help or at least basic courtesy, like sitting up when someone else is working hard to help them. The dad was angry because the boyfriend did nothing, which is understandable. \n\nIn relationships, contributing to problem-solving and showing respect to each other's family are important. The boyfriend's lack of action and attitude might come off as dismissive. The author isn't wrong for expecting her boyfriend to be more helpful, especially in a shared living situation. The severity of the problem (no toilet for days) adds to the stress, making the boyfriend's inaction more noticeable.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend might feel he was justified if he had a valid reason not to help, but the story doesn't mention any. He just lay down and didn't assist. The fact that the dad was unprepared and had to take a shower also shows that the situation was worse than the boyfriend acknowledged. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior was inconsiderate, and the author's expectations are reasonable.\n"
