I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation involving their boyfriend and his father. The main issue seems to be the boyfriend's behavior when the author's dad came to fix the clogged toilet.\n\nFirst, the toilet was a big problem because it's a small apartment with no other bathroom. The boyfriend tried to unclog it but then gave up, and when the author asked for help from her dad, he agreed but didn't help. Then when the dad arrived, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't assist, even though the dad did all the work. The dad got upset because the boyfriend didn't contribute and now refuses to talk to him. The boyfriend is dismissing the situation, saying it wasn't urgent and that he was fine with the dad fixing it, even disagreeing with his method. The author feels it's a matter of basic courtesy that he should have helped.\n\nSo, the key points here are about expectations of behavior in shared living situations and helping out when a guest is doing a favor. The boyfriend's actions (or lack thereof) during a stressful and physically demanding task might be seen as inconsiderate. Even if he disagreed with the method, not helping at all could be viewed as disrespectful towards the author's dad, especially when the author was already stressed and the task was unpleasant. \n\nFrom a social norms perspective, when someone comes to help with a task, especially a messy one, it's customary for the host (in this case, the boyfriend) to offer assistance or at least show respect by being present and helpful. Lying down and doing nothing might be seen as dismissive and ungrateful. The boyfriend's justification that he didn't need to help because he disagreed with the method is weak, as helping could still be done without endorsing the method. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for expecting her boyfriend to show some level of respect and participation, especially since it's their home and the problem affects both of them. The boyfriend's reaction that the author isn't meeting \"real world standards\" seems to be a cop-out, dismissing her valid feelings. Therefore, the boyfriend is likely in the wrong here, making the author not at fault.\n"
