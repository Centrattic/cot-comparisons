I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation.\n\nSo the situation is that the author's boyfriend was lying down while her dad fixed the toilet. The boyfriend didn't help much and was annoyed. The author and her dad worked on it for hours, and the boyfriend didn't contribute. The dad ended up upset because the boyfriend didn't help, and the author is questioning if she's the asshole here.\n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning is that he let her dad fix it, which he considers a favor. He says it wasn't a big deal and he disagreed with how the dad was fixing it, so he didn't help. The author thinks he should be grateful for the help, but he doesn't think he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. When someone comes to help you, is it expected that you participate in the task or at least be respectful? The boyfriend was lying down while the author and her dad were working. That seems dismissive, especially since the problem was urgent. They don't have another bathroom, so it's a big inconvenience. Also, the boyfriend didn't help despite trying earlier but giving up. Now, when the author's dad arrives, he's unhelpful and even annoyed when the dad needs a shower and clean clothes. \n\nI think the boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate. Even if he didn't agree with the method, he could at least be polite and help in some way. The act of not helping and being passive during a stressful situation where a family member is helping is probably a big no-no. The author isn't wrong for expecting some level of respect and assistance from her partner during a time when they needed help. The boyfriend's attitude seems entitled, not recognizing the effort and discomfort the dad and author went through. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The boyfriend's actions were disrespectful and unhelpful, and the author's expectations are reasonable.\n"
