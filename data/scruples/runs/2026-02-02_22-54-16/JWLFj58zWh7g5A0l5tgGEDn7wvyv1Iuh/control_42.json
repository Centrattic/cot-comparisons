I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a clogged toilet that they tried to fix. The boyfriend was lying down while the author and her dad worked on it. The key points here are about responsibility, effort, and respect.\n\nFirst, the toilet was clogged for a couple of days, causing a mess. The author tried, then her boyfriend tried for an hour, and then she tried for two more hours. When her dad came over, the boyfriend was just lying down, not helping. The dad fixed it in three hours while the boyfriend didn't contribute. The dad was upset, and now the boyfriend is arguing that he did nothing wrong, even though he was the one who initially caused the clog (because of his stomach issues).\n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning is that he let the dad fix it, which he shouldn't have a problem with, but the author and her dad expected him to help. The boyfriend also says he disagreed with how her dad fixed it, which might explain his inaction, but maybe that's not a valid reason to not at least assist. \n\nThe author feels he should have helped, especially since it was his problem in the first place. The boyfriend not helping when the dad was there, especially while lying down, might be seen as disrespectful or uncooperative. The dad was doing the work, and the boyfriend didn't even offer to help, which could be why he's upset. \n\nIs the author wrong? Probably not. The boyfriend didn't take responsibility. Even if he disagreed with the method, he could have at least tried to help or supported by cleaning up. The dad was there as a favor, and the boyfriend's lack of effort might be rude. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
