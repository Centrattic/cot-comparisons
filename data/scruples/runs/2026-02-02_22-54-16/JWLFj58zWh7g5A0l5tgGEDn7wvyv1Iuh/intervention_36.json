I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person writing the story) is in the wrong when their boyfriend didn't help fix the clogged toilet and instead lay around while her dad did all the work.\n\nFirst, the situation: the toilet was clogged for a couple of days after the boyfriend had stomach issues. They bought an auger, he tried for an hour, then she tried for two more. When they called her dad, the boyfriend was lying down the whole time. The dad had to work for three hours, got dirty, and the boyfriend even seemed annoyed when the dad asked for clean clothes. Now the dad is upset with the boyfriend, and the author is conflicted about their BF's behavior.\n\nThe BF's reasoning is that he didn't have to help because he disagreed with how the dad was fixing it, and he says the author should be grateful he allowed her dad to fix it. The author feels that the BF should have been more helpful and showed basic courtesy.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main points here are expectations in relationships. When someone does a favor, especially a significant one like fixing a toilet full of waste, it's generally expected that the person receiving the help shows gratitude and maybe some active participation. The boyfriend didn't help at all during the repair, was uncooperative, and even showed disdain. That's a red flag. \n\nThe author tried to handle the problem first, but when it became too much, getting help was necessary. The boyfriend's lack of support during her efforts and then not helping when her dad was there is the main issue. In a relationship, especially after living together for four years, mutual support is expected. The BF's attitude that it wasn't urgent and that he didn't need to help unless he agreed with the method seems dismissive and inconsiderate.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. Her BF's behavior was unhelpful and disrespectful, and the author's frustration is valid. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
