I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with their boyfriend. The situation involves a clogged toilet that they tried to fix together, but the boyfriend ended up not helping and lying down while the author's dad did the work. The author is upset because they expected the boyfriend to be more helpful and respectful towards their dad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The toilet was clogged for a couple of days, which is a big problem, especially in a small apartment without another bathroom. The boyfriend tried for an hour, then the author tried for two more hours, but the problem wasn't resolved. Then the author called her dad, who fixed it after three hours. During that time, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't help. The dad got angry because of this, and the boyfriend is defending his lack of action by saying it wasn't urgent and that he disagreed with the method the dad used. The author feels the boyfriend should have been more grateful and helpful.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks she isn't, but wants confirmation. Let me think about social norms and expectations in relationships. In a partnership, especially when living together, helping each other out with household tasks is usually expected. The boyfriend didn't contribute during the dad's help, which could be seen as disrespectful. Even if he disagreed with the method, he could have at least shown some support. The fact that he was unhelpful and ungrateful might have caused the dad to be upset. The author's frustration is valid because she tried to fix the problem herself first, then brought in her dad, expecting some help from her partner. The boyfriend's response seems dismissive and not appreciative, which could be a sign of poor communication or lack of consideration. \n\nI should also consider if there's any nuance I'm missing. Maybe the boyfriend was stressed or had a reason not to help, but the scenario doesn't mention that. The key here is the expectation of mutual support in a relationship. The boyfriend's behavior might be seen as selfish or inconsiderate, especially when the situation was causing significant discomfort. The author isn't in the wrong for expecting her partner to be helpful and respectful. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
