I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a clogged toilet and how the boyfriend handled it. The author's boyfriend was lying down while her dad fixed the toilet, and he didn't help much. The author is upset because she expected more help and respect towards her dad.\n\nFirst, the toilet was clogged for a while, and they tried to fix it themselves with tools. The boyfriend tried for an hour, then the author tried for two hours. They couldn't fix it, so they called the author's dad. The dad fixed it in three hours, and the boyfriend didn't help during that time. He was just lying down. The dad got upset because he was treated disrespectfully. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he didn't have to help and disagreed with how the dad fixed it.\n\nSo, the main points here are: Did the boyfriend act disrespectfully by not helping? Is the author wrong to expect him to be more involved or respectful towards her dad?\n\nThe boyfriend says he didn't have to help and thought it wasn't urgent. But the toilet wasn't working for days, which is a big deal, especially in a small apartment. The boyfriend didn't contribute when his partner was struggling. When her dad came, he didn't help, just laid down. That's pretty passive. The dad was doing the work, and the boyfriend didn't assist even when the problem was in their home. Also, the boyfriend didn't like the dad's method, but that's not a reason to not help. Maybe he could have offered to assist in another way.\n\nThe author expects gratitude and help from her boyfriend, which seems reasonable. The boyfriend's attitude seems dismissive. The dad was doing a favor, and expecting some respect and maybe help is normal. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The boyfriend's behavior was inconsiderate. So the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
