I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a toilet clog that required fixing, and the boyfriend's behavior during the process.\n\nFirst, the toilet was clogged after the boyfriend had stomach issues. The author tried to fix it first, then bought an auger with some tension. Then the boyfriend tried for an hour, and the author tried for two more hours. The boyfriend was urging her to give up. Then the author asked her dad to help, and the dad came over. However, during the time the dad was fixing it, the boyfriend was laying down, not helping, and even criticized the dad's methods. The dad was upset because the boyfriend didn't help and even had an issue with the dad needing a shower and shorts. The boyfriend later claims that the author should be grateful he allowed her dad to fix it and that he didn't have to help anyway.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points to consider are expectations of behavior in such situations. Typically, when someone helps a friend or family member by doing a favor, especially something as unpleasant as fixing a toilet full of waste, the host is expected to show gratitude and at least offer assistance. The boyfriend's behavior of doing nothing, not even offering to help, and being uncooperative could be seen as disrespectful towards the author's father.\n\nThe boyfriend's justification is that he allowed the dad to fix the toilet, so the author should be grateful. However, allowing someone to help is different from being ungrateful or uncooperative. The boyfriend's lack of action and negative attitude might contribute to the dad's anger. The author's perspective is that basic courtesy and assistance are expected when someone comes to help in an emergency, which aligns with common social norms.\n\nIn terms of fault, the boyfriend's actions (or lack thereof) are problematic. The author isn't in the wrong for expecting her boyfriend to show some level of respect and help, especially given the situation's urgency and the help provided by her father. The boyfriend's refusal to assist and his dismissive attitude are the main issues here. Therefore, the answer is B; the author is not in the wrong.\n"
