I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a clogged toilet that they couldn't fix themselves, so they called the author's dad. The boyfriend was lying down while the dad fixed it and later acted ungrateful. The boyfriend claims he did nothing wrong, while the author and her dad are upset.\n\nFirst, looking at the boyfriend's actions. He was already annoyed when they bought the tool. Then he tried for an hour, but after that, he wanted the author to give up. When the dad came, the BF just laid down, didn't help, and even got upset when the dad needed clean clothes. The BF's reasoning is that he should be grateful he let the dad fix it, and he didn't think it was urgent. He also claims he disagreed with how the dad was fixing it.\n\nCommon courtesy would suggest that when someone helps you, especially in a situation like fixing a toilet, you should at least be present, help if possible, and show gratitude. The BF didn't contribute during the repair, was uncooperative, and then reacted poorly to the dad's request for clean clothes. His attitude seems dismissive and unappreciative. The fact that he thought it wasn't urgent when they had a backup for days and no other bathroom adds to the problem. The author isn't in the wrong for expecting her BF to be polite and helpful. The BF's response is unreasonable. So the answer is B.\n"
