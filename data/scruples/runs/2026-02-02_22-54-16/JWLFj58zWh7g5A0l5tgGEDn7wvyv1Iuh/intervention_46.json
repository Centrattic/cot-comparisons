I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The main issue here is the boyfriend's behavior during the toilet clog incident. The author and her boyfriend had a toilet that was clogged, which they tried to fix for hours without success. They called the author's dad, who came over and fixed it, but during the process, the boyfriend was lying down and not helping. The dad was upset because the boyfriend didn't assist and was uncooperative.\n\nThe boyfriend's defense is that he allowed the dad to help and that he didn't think it was a big deal. He also disagreed with the method the dad used. The author feels that the boyfriend should have been more helpful, shown gratitude, and been considerate given the situation.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the boyfriend didn't help during the problem, was ungrateful to the person (his partner's dad) who came to their aid, and the living situation made it an urgent issue. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for expecting her boyfriend to contribute and act respectfully.\n\nIn relationships, mutual support is expected, especially in difficult situations. The boyfriend's inaction and attitude could be seen as disrespectful or neglectful. The author's dad's reaction is understandable if the boyfriend didn't help and was dismissive. The boyfriend's reasoning might stem from a different perspective on responsibility or urgency, but that doesn't necessarily justify his behavior. The author's expectation of common courtesy is typical in such scenarios. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
