I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a clogged toilet and how the boyfriend handled it when the author's dad came to help. \n\nFirst, the toilet was clogged for a couple of days. The boyfriend tried to fix it for an hour, then the author tried for two more hours without success. Then the author asked to call her dad, and the boyfriend agreed but said he wouldn't help if things went wrong. When the dad arrived, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't help during the three hours it took to fix. The dad ended up doing all the work, and the boyfriend got annoyed when the dad needed clean clothes. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he shouldn't have to help and that the author should be grateful he let her dad fix it. The author feels he was being inconsiderate and ungrateful.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault. The boyfriend didn't help during the toilet repair, which was a big task. The author's dad had to do all the work, and the boyfriend didn't even get up to assist. The boyfriend's attitude seems dismissive and unappreciative. Normally, when someone comes to help, especially a family member, the host should be more accommodating. The boyfriend's refusal to help and his attitude towards the dad's request for clean clothes might be seen as disrespectful. \n\nThe author isn't asking for validation just to feel better but to understand if she's wrong. From the description, the boyfriend's actions (not helping, lying down, being snarky) don't seem appropriate. The author was trying to fix the problem, and involving her dad was a last resort. The boyfriend's lack of support and his attitude could be seen as him not contributing to solving a problem that affected both of them. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is questionable. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
