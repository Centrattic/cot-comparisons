I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's boyfriend not helping when their toilet was clogged and instead lying down while the author and her dad dealt with it.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The toilet clogged after the boyfriend had stomach issues. The author tried to fix it first, then they bought an auger. The boyfriend tried for an hour, then the author tried for two more hours. The boyfriend was urging her to give up. Then the author asked her dad to help, which the boyfriend agreed to, but when the dad arrived, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't participate. After three hours, the dad fixed it, and the boyfriend was upset when the dad needed clean clothes. The boyfriend later claimed it wasn't urgent and that he disagreed with the dad's method, so he chose to do nothing. The author is upset that her BF wasn't helpful and that her dad is angry at him. The BF thinks she should be grateful he let the dad help, implying she's delusional for expecting more.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let's break it down. The boyfriend's actions: he didn't help during the toilet issue, lay down while the dad was working, and later criticized the situation. The author and her dad had to handle the whole messy situation alone. The dad was angry because the BF didn't contribute. The BF's reasoning is that he's not obligated to help, and that he's not responsible for the urgency. But is that a valid perspective?\n\nIn most relationships, mutual support is expected. When someone comes to help (the dad), the recipient (BF) should at least be polite and contribute if possible. Lying down during a crisis, especially when there's no other bathroom, seems inconsiderate. The BF's attitude of not helping and being dismissive could be seen as selfish. The author's expectation of gratitude and basic courtesy is reasonable. The BF's claim that he didn't do anything wrong might be his opinion, but many would see him as not supporting his partner during a stressful time and not respecting the helper (the dad). Therefore, the author is likely not in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
