I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong in their situation with their boyfriend. The boyfriend was unhelpful when their toilet clogged, didn't participate in fixing it, and lay down while the author and her dad worked on it. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he didn't do anything wrong, even though he had been trying earlier. The author feels he's being ungrateful and inconsiderate.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The toilet was a big problem, especially in a small apartment without another bathroom. The boyfriend did try to unclog it for an hour before the author took over. However, when the author's dad came over to help, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't assist. The dad ended up doing all the work, and the boyfriend was even upset about the dad needing clean clothes.\n\nThe key points here are teamwork and gratitude. When someone helps you, especially in a difficult situation like fixing a toilet, you're expected to show appreciation and maybe offer some help. The boyfriend's lack of participation during the dad's visit and his dismissive attitude could be seen as inconsiderate. However, he did try earlier. But when the dad was there, the boyfriend didn't contribute, which is the main issue.\n\nThe author's dad was upset because the boyfriend didn't help, which is understandable. The boyfriend's reasoning that he didn't have to help because he disagreed with the method might be an excuse. Disagreement with the method doesn't absolve someone from offering assistance in an emergency.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for expecting their boyfriend to be grateful and help out. The boyfriend's behavior seems to lack the basic courtesy expected in such a scenario. The author's feelings of being baffled and the dad's anger suggest that the boyfriend's actions were inappropriate. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
