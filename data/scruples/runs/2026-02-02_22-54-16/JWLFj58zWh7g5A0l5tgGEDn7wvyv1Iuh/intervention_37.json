I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a boyfriend who was unhelpful when the toilet clogged and their dad came to fix it. The boyfriend was lying down the whole time while the author and their dad worked. The boyfriend claims he did nothing wrong, but the author feels he should have been more helpful and respectful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The toilet was clogged, which is a big problem in a small apartment with no other bathroom. The boyfriend tried for an hour, then the author tried for two hours. Then the author's dad came, and the boyfriend was just lying down. The dad got upset because he was doing all the work, and the boyfriend didn't help. The boyfriend's reasoning was that he didn't want to help and that he didn't agree with how the dad was doing it. He also didn't offer help when the dad needed clean clothes after the job.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, the boyfriend didn't contribute, didn't show appreciation, and was disrespectful. The dad was angry, which makes sense because he did all the work. The author is upset because they expected the boyfriend to at least help or be courteous.\n\nNow, considering social norms, when someone helps you, especially in a difficult situation like fixing a toilet, it's expected to be grateful and offer assistance. The boyfriend's inaction and lack of support might be seen as inconsiderate. Also, lying down while others are working hard could be perceived as not taking the situation seriously.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that he let the dad help, so he shouldn't be blamed. But the issue here is more about his behavior during the process. Not helping, not showing support, and not offering to assist when needed (like getting clean clothes) are all points against him. The dad's anger is a valid reaction to being ignored and not having help.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for expecting basic courtesy and support from their partner. It's reasonable to expect someone to be helpful and respectful in such a situation. The boyfriend's behavior seems to lack empathy and appreciation for the effort others are putting in. Therefore, the author is not at fault here.\n"
