I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a toilet clog that became a big issue because their 40 m2 apartment has no other bathroom, and the boyfriend was supposedly lying down while the author and her dad dealt with it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The toilet clogged after the boyfriend had stomach issues. The author tried to unclog it first, which didn't work. They bought an auger, and the boyfriend tried for an hour but then the author tried for two more hours while he told her to give up. Then she asked to call her dad, and the boyfriend agreed on the condition that he wouldn't help if things went wrong. When the dad arrived, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't assist. The dad worked for three hours, the author helped clean up, and the dad was upset that the BF didn't contribute. The BF's defense is that he thought it wasn't urgent, disagreed with the dad's method, and that the author should be grateful he allowed the dad to help.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for being upset. The user thinks she's not, but wants others' opinions. From a social norms perspective, when someone helps with a messy, urgent task, it's expected that the host (the couple) would offer assistance. The boyfriend's lack of involvement and being ungrateful could be seen as rude. His reason for not helping\u2014disagreeing with the method\u2014is a bit weak. Even if he didn't agree, he could have at least helped in some way or showed appreciation. The fact that he was lying down while the dad worked for three hours might be the main point here. The space constraint (no other bathroom, bed next to toilet) adds to the urgency and discomfort. The dad's anger is justified because the BF didn't help, which is a matter of respect and contribution. The author's expectations about common courtesy seem reasonable. So, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
