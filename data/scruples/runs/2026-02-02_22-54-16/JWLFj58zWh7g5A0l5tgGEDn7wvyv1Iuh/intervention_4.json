I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend who didn't help during a toilet clog emergency, even when the author's dad had to come over and fix it. \n\nFirst, the context: the toilet was clogged, the boyfriend tried for an hour but then the author tried for two more hours without success. When the author's dad arrived, the boyfriend was laying down and didn't help. The dad fixed it, got his clothes dirty, and the boyfriend reacted negatively. The boyfriend claims it wasn't urgent and that he disagreed with the dad's method.\n\nThe key points here are about responsibility, effort, and respect. The boyfriend did try initially but then stopped, maybe not putting in enough effort. The author's dad came in to help, and the boyfriend didn't assist or at least show gratitude. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he let the dad fix it, but the issue is more about his lack of action and respect towards the dad's help.\n\nCommon courtesy in such situations would typically involve the person (the boyfriend) helping as much as possible or at least being respectful when others come to help. The boyfriend's behavior of lying down and not assisting, plus the negative reaction to the dad's dirty clothes, shows a lack of consideration.\n\nThe author's dad was clearly upset, which is a strong indicator that the boyfriend's actions were inappropriate. The boyfriend's justification about not being urgent and disagreeing with the method seems dismissive and possibly an excuse to avoid responsibility. \n\nIn terms of expectations, the author isn't being unreasonable. Most people would expect some effort from a partner and respect towards someone helping them. The boyfriend's actions don't meet those basic expectations. The author isn't in the wrong here because they sought help when their partner couldn't solve the problem and expected respect, which was not given. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue, not the author's response to it. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
