I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about their boyfriend's behavior during a toilet clog situation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The toilet clogged after the boyfriend had stomach issues. They tried to unclog it themselves, but it didn't work. The author tried for hours while the boyfriend urged her to give up. Then they called the author's dad. When the dad arrived, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't help during the three hours the dad was fixing the toilet. The boyfriend later criticized the dad for not being prepared when he wasn't, and he claims that he didn't do anything wrong.\n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning is that he let the dad fix it, so the author should be grateful. He says it wasn't urgent and that he disagreed with how the dad was fixing it. The author feels he should have helped or at least shown more respect.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider social norms and expectations. When someone does a favor, especially something as unpleasant as fixing a toilet full of\u5c4e, common courtesy would suggest that the host should be helpful or at least show appreciation. The boyfriend didn't contribute, was uncooperative, and later criticized the helper. This seems inconsiderate. The author's dad was angry because the boyfriend didn't help, which is understandable. The boyfriend's attitude of doing nothing and dismissing the urgency might be the issue here.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument that he's not at fault because he allowed the dad to help is weak because it's not just about allowing but also about contributing. The situation is in their own home, and the boyfriend's lack of assistance during the process, especially when it was taking three hours and involved a lot of work, could be seen as neglectful. Also, lying down while his girlfriend and her dad were working on it might be seen as disrespectful.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for expecting her boyfriend to help or at least show basic courtesy. The boyfriend's behavior was inconsiderate, so the author isn't the one at fault.\n"
