I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation described. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nSo, the author's boyfriend was uncooperative when their toilet clogged. The boyfriend tried to unclog it for an hour, then the author tried for two more hours. When the boyfriend was annoyed and didn't help, the author asked her dad to come over. The dad fixed it in three hours, but during that time, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't participate. The dad got angry because the boyfriend didn't help, and now he's not speaking to him. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he should be grateful he let the dad fix it, and he didn't think it was that urgent. The author feels the boyfriend should have been more helpful and courteous.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about responsibility, cooperation in a shared living situation, and basic courtesy. The boyfriend was part of the problem since he had stomach issues, which might have caused the clog. Then, when the situation required fixing the toilet, he didn't contribute much. When the author's dad came to help, the boyfriend was unhelpful, even lying down, which could be seen as disrespectful or dismissive.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that he let the author's dad fix it, and he didn't think it was urgent. But from the author's perspective, the boyfriend should have helped more, especially since they were in a small apartment without an alternative bathroom. The dad was doing a favor and expected some assistance or at least respect.\n\nIn relationships, especially when living together, it's expected that both partners share responsibilities. The boyfriend tried a bit but then didn't continue helping and was unhelpful when the dad arrived. The dad's reaction seems valid because he was doing a favor and expected some support. The boyfriend's lack of assistance and apparent indifference could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nThe author isn't wrong for feeling upset. She's trying to resolve a problem, and her boyfriend's behavior was uncooperative. The boyfriend's reasoning doesn't seem to account for the effort the author put in or the dad's help. It's about mutual respect and contributing to shared problems.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions were inconsiderate, and expecting some level of help or courtesy in such a situation is reasonable.\n"
