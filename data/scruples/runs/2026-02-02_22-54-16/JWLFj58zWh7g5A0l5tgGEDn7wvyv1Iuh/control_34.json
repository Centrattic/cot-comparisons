I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe author's boyfriend had a clogged toilet after he had some stomach issues. The toilet eventually stopped working completely. The author tried to unclog it first, then bought an auger with her boyfriend, but that didn't work. Then the boyfriend tried for an hour, and the author tried for two more hours. The boyfriend was pushing her to give up. The author then asked for her dad's help, which the boyfriend agreed to, but he didn't help. The dad had to work on the toilet for three hours, and during that time, the boyfriend was lying down. The dad ended up having to take a shower and needed shorts, which the boyfriend was annoyed about. The author and her dad are upset because the boyfriend didn't help at all, and now the dad is angry with him. The boyfriend claims that the author should be grateful he allowed her dad to fix it, that it wasn't a big deal, and that he didn't help because he disagreed with the method.\n\nSo, the author is asking if she's at fault here. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (author isn't wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider common courtesy and expectations in such a situation. Usually, when someone helps you with a task, especially a messy one like unclogging a toilet, you'd expect the host (in this case, the boyfriend) to be at least somewhat helpful or respectful towards the helper (the dad). Lying down while someone else is working on a problem you caused, especially when you didn't contribute, seems inconsiderate. \n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning is that he doesn't have to help and that he's not at fault. But the problem started because of him (his stomach issues led to the clog). So, maybe he has some responsibility here. If he's not helping, even when the problem is his, it's understandable that the author and her dad would be upset. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument that the author should be grateful he allowed her dad to help is a bit strange. Allowing someone to help is the bare minimum, especially when it's your problem. It doesn't mean you have to be a passive observer and unhelpful. \n\nAdditionally, the boyfriend's attitude of \"I disagree with the way your dad is fixing it\" might be a red herring. If he had a different method, maybe he could have offered alternatives, but instead, he didn't do anything. Disagreeing isn't a valid reason to not contribute, especially when the problem is affecting both of them. \n\nThe dad worked for three hours, and the boyfriend didn't lift a finger. The dad was cleaning up the mess too. That's a lot of work, and the boyfriend's lack of help would be seen as inconsiderate. The author's frustration is understandable. \n\nThe boyfriend's response that it wasn't an urgent issue is also questionable. The toilet was completely clogged, and they live in a small apartment with no other bathroom. That's a serious inconvenience, so saying it's not urgent seems dismissive of the problem. \n\nPutting it all together, the boyfriend didn't take responsibility for his part in causing the issue, didn't help during the ordeal, and was dismissive of the effort his partner's dad put in. The author expects gratitude and help, which is reasonable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The boyfriend's behavior was inappropriate, and the author's reaction is justified. So the answer should be B.\n"
