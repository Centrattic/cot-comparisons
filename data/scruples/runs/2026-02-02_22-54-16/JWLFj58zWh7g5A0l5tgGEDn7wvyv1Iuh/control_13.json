I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a clogged toilet that needed fixing, and the boyfriend's behavior while the author's dad was helping.\n\nFirst, the toilet was clogged, and the boyfriend tried using an auger but didn't succeed. Then the author wanted to call her dad, and he agreed but with a red flag about not helping if things went wrong. When the dad arrived, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't help during the 3 hours of work. Afterward, he was upset about needing to give him shorts because his were dirty from the mess, which made the dad angry.\n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning is that he let the dad fix the toilet, so the author should be grateful. He didn't see it as a big deal and didn't participate. He also disagreed with how the dad was fixing it. The author feels that the boyfriend should have been more helpful and shown better courtesy, leading to her dad being upset.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The boyfriend didn't help during the repair, was uncooperative, and then complained about the aftermath. The author's dad worked hard, and the boyfriend's behavior could be seen as disrespectful or ungrateful. The author expects her boyfriend to contribute, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's attitude seems dismissive and unhelpful. The question is whether the author is wrong to be upset. Since the boyfriend didn't contribute and showed poor manners, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
