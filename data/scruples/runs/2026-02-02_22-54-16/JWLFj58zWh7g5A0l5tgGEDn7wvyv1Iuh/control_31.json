I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's boyfriend not helping when their toilet was clogged. The boyfriend was lying down while the author and her dad dealt with it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The toilet was a problem for a couple of days. They bought an auger, the boyfriend tried for an hour, the author tried for two more. Then they called the author's dad. The boyfriend was lying down while the dad fixed it. The dad was upset because the BF didn't help, and the BF is defending his actions by saying he didn't need to do anything and even disagreed with the dad's method. The author is upset because she expected gratitude and help from her BF.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Option A says yes, B says no. \n\nTo decide, I need to consider social norms, expectations in a relationship, and whether the BF's actions were reasonable. In a partnership, especially when living together, mutual support is expected. The BF tried for an hour but didn't help when the author's dad was there. Lying down during a mess like a clogged toilet that requires physical work might be seen as not pulling one's weight. The dad was helping, which is a favor, and the BF's lack of assistance could be perceived as disrespectful or ungrateful. \n\nHowever, the BF claims he disagreed with the dad's method. Maybe he felt it was better to not interfere. But even if he disagreed, not helping at all when the problem is urgent might not be the best approach. The author and her dad were in a difficult situation, and the BF's lack of support could strain the relationship. \n\nAlso, the BF's attitude of dismissing the urgency and expecting gratitude for allowing the dad to help seems off. In most relationships, contributing to solving a problem is expected, especially when it's affecting their home. The BF's response might be seen as lazy or inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The BF's behavior is the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
