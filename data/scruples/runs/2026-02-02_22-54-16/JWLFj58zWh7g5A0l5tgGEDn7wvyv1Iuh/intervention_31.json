I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a toilet clog that needed fixing, and the boyfriend's behavior during the process. The author is asking if she's in the wrong (AITA). \n\nFirst, the toilet was clogged after her boyfriend had stomach issues. She tried to fix it first, then they bought an auger. He tried for an hour, she tried for two more, and then she called her dad. When her dad arrived, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't help. The dad fixed it, but the boyfriend was uncooperative, even getting upset about the dad needing clean clothes. Now the dad is angry, and the boyfriend claims the author is the one at fault.\n\nThe key points here are about responsibility and respect. When someone helps another person, especially in a situation that's unpleasant like cleaning a clogged toilet, the expectation is usually for the host to be appreciative and offer assistance. The boyfriend did nothing and was ungrateful, which could be seen as inconsiderate. The author and her dad actively worked on the problem, while the boyfriend was passive. \n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning that he didn't do anything wrong because he allowed the dad to fix it doesn't address the lack of effort or courtesy. Being grateful isn't about the magnitude of the problem but about acknowledging someone's help. The boyfriend's attitude of not helping and being critical seems to be the issue here. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because she expected her boyfriend to contribute and show respect towards her dad's efforts. It's reasonable to expect basic courtesy and participation, especially in a shared living situation. The boyfriend's behavior crossed a line, making the author not at fault.\n"
