I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario involves a boyfriend who was supposed to help unclog the toilet but ended up lying down while the author's dad did all the work. The boyfriend also didn't help when the author's dad was cleaning and even had an issue with the dad needing shorts. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The toilet clogged, both tried to fix it with tools, but the boyfriend gave up and then lay down while the author's dad did the job. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he just let the author's dad fix it, and he didn't think it was urgent. He also claims he didn't agree with the dad's method. The author feels that the boyfriend should have been more helpful and showed gratitude, but the boyfriend doesn't see it that way.\n\nNow, considering social norms around helping and gratitude. When someone does a favor, especially a physically demanding and unpleasant one like fixing a clogged toilet, it's expected that the person receiving the help would show appreciation and possibly assist in the process. The boyfriend didn't help during the dad's work, didn't clean up, and even had an attitude about the dad needing clothes. That seems inconsiderate.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument that it's not a big deal or urgent might be a way to downplay the situation. However, the author and her dad were dealing with a non-functioning toilet for multiple days, which is a significant inconvenience. The boyfriend's lack of effort in resolving it himself before calling in help could also be a point of contention. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for expecting her boyfriend to contribute, especially since they live together. It's reasonable to expect mutual effort in maintaining the household. The boyfriend's dismissiveness towards the situation and the lack of gratitude from him might be why the dad is upset. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If she asked her dad for help because her boyfriend wasn't helping, that's a normal reaction. The boyfriend's behavior, however, seems to be the issue here. He didn't take responsibility, didn't assist, and didn't show proper gratitude. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
