I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in their situation with the boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the context: The toilet clogged, they tried to fix it, the boyfriend was unhelpful, and when the author's dad came to fix it, the boyfriend was laying down and didn't contribute. The dad got angry because the BF didn't help, and the BF claims it's not a big deal and he didn't do anything wrong.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault. The options are A (yes, author wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nLooking at the situation, the BF didn't participate in fixing the toilet. He tried for an hour but then the author took over. When the dad came, the BF was uncooperative. The BF's reasoning is that the author should be grateful he let the dad fix it. But the dad's effort was massive and messy, and the BF didn't support him. \n\nIn terms of social expectations, when someone helps you with something as big as a toilet clog, especially under such circumstances (no other bathroom, living in a small place), the BF should have been more helpful or at least respectful. His lack of participation and attitude led to the dad being upset. The BF's argument that it's not urgent is weak because the toilet wasn't working for days. Also, the BF's refusal to help and the dad's effort make the BF's stance seem inconsiderate.\n\nSo, the BF is the one in the wrong here. The author isn't at fault for expecting some level of support and respect from her partner. Therefore, the answer is B (author not in the wrong).\n"
