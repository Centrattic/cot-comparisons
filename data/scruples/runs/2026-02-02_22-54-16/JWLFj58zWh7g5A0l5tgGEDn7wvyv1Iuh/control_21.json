I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user and her boyfriend are dealing with a clogged toilet. The boyfriend had stomach issues, leading to the clog. They tried to unclog it themselves, but failed. The boyfriend tried for an hour, then the author tried for two hours, but he kept telling her to give up. Then she asked her dad to help, and he was okay with it but didn't want to take responsibility if things went wrong. When the dad arrived, the boyfriend was lying down the whole time, didn't help, and even got upset when the dad needed clean clothes.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the boyfriend acted inappropriately. The author is upset because her boyfriend didn't help during the toilet fixing, didn't show gratitude, and was dismissive. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he didn't have to help, it wasn't a big deal, and he disagreed with how the dad was fixing it. \n\nFirst, in a relationship where they live together, especially after four years, it's reasonable to expect mutual support in household tasks. The toilet being clogged is a significant problem, especially in a small apartment with no other bathroom. The boyfriend tried for an hour but then didn't continue, and instead of helping during the dad's visit, he remained passive. Lying down while someone else is dealing with a messy situation might be seen as disrespectful or uncooperative. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's comment about not helping if things went wrong could be a red flag because he's not taking responsibility. When the dad was there, the boyfriend not assisting might come off as lazy or inconsiderate. The dad's anger is understandable given the lack of help and the ungrateful attitude. The boyfriend's belief that he did nothing wrong and the author is overreacting might indicate a lack of empathy. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel overwhelmed or frustrated, but that doesn't justify not contributing or showing basic courtesy. The author's dad was there to help, and the boyfriend's behavior could have been very unkind. The author isn't asking for validation just for the sake of being right, but understanding why the boyfriend thinks that way. \n\nConsidering all this, the boyfriend's actions seem to be in the wrong. The author had a valid expectation for support and respect during a challenging situation. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
