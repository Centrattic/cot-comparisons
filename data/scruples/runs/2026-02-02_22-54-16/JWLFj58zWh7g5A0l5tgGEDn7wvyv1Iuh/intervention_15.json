I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about their boyfriend not helping when the toilet clogged and instead lying down while the author's dad fixed it. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The toilet clogged after the boyfriend had stomach issues. The author tried to unclog it first, then they bought an auger. The boyfriend tried for an hour, then the author tried for two more hours. They couldn't fix it, so the author called her dad. The boyfriend was okay with that but said he wouldn't help if things went wrong. When the dad arrived, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't help. The dad fixed it, and the boyfriend was annoyed when the dad asked for clean clothes. Now the dad is angry, and the boyfriend thinks the author should be grateful he allowed the dad to help.\n\nSo the key points are: the boyfriend didn't contribute during the toilet repair, didn't help even when the author was struggling, and showed disrespect towards the author's dad. The author feels he should have been more helpful and respectful, while the boyfriend thinks he did nothing wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and I need to see if that's accurate. \n\nIn relationships, mutual support and respect are important. If one partner is in a tough situation, like dealing with a clogged toilet, the other is expected to help, especially since it's their shared home. The boyfriend's reaction of lying down and not assisting suggests a lack of support. Also, being unhelpful when the author's dad was working on it might come off as disrespectful. The dad did the work, so expecting some level of respect and assistance from the boyfriend is reasonable.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument that he let the dad fix it doesn't hold because allowing someone to help isn't the same as being proactive in contributing. The author and her dad were dealing with a messy, urgent problem, and the boyfriend's refusal to help or even offer support could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nThere's no indication the author is at fault here. She tried to fix the problem, then sought help when it didn't work. Her dad stepped in because they were stuck. The boyfriend's lack of effort and respect is the main issue. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
