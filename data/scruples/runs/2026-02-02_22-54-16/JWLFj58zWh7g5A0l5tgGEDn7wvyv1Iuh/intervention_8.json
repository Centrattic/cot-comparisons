I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a boyfriend who didn't help when the toilet was clogged and instead lay down while the author's dad fixed it. The author is upset because her BF didn't assist and was ungrateful when her dad helped.\n\nFirst, let me break down the key points. The toilet was clogged after the BF had stomach issues. The author tried to fix it first, then they bought an auger. The BF tried for an hour, then she tried for two more hours. When she asked to call her dad, he agreed but with a red flag condition. Then, when the dad came, the BF was lying down and didn't help. The BF later criticized the dad's methods and was unprepared for the mess, leading the dad to be angry.\n\nThe BF's side is that he thinks he did nothing wrong, that the author should be grateful he let her dad fix it, and that it wasn't a big deal. He also said he disagreed with how the dad fixed it, implying he didn't want to help even if he could. The author feels it's a matter of common courtesy to help when someone else is doing the work, especially since they were in their own home and the problem was urgent.\n\nSo, who's right here? Let's consider social norms and expectations. When someone comes to your home to help with a problem like a clogged toilet, especially one that's quite messy, it's customary for the hosts to be present, at least. Lying down and doing nothing while someone else works hard and gets dirty might be seen as inconsiderate. The BF not helping could be viewed as not taking responsibility for his own home's maintenance. \n\nThe BF's argument that the author should be grateful he allowed her dad to fix it seems weak because he didn't do any of the work himself. If someone's toilet is clogged and they can't fix it, calling someone else for help is normal, but expecting the BF to at least assist or be present while the work is done is reasonable. \n\nAlso, the BF's criticism of the dad's method after the fact might indicate he was passive-aggressively not wanting to help. The fact that the dad left angry because the BF didn't help reinforces that the BF's behavior was inappropriate.\n\nThe author's dad stepping in was necessary because the BF wasn't able to resolve it. The BF's lack of action and then being ungrateful is likely the main issue here. The author's expectations of common courtesy are reasonable. People generally expect their partners to be involved in solving problems, especially when they impact daily living. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The BF's behavior was dismissive and unhelpful, and the author's reaction is justified. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
