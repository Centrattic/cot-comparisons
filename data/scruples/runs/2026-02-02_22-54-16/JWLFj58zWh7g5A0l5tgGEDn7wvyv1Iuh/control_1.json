I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a toilet clog and the boyfriend's behavior when the author's dad came to fix it. \n\nFirst, the toilet clogged after the boyfriend had stomach issues. The author tried first, then they bought an auger. The boyfriend tried for an hour, then the author tried for two hours. Then they called the author's dad. When the dad arrived, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't help during the three hours the dad was working. The dad was upset, the author is upset, and the boyfriend doesn't think he did anything wrong.\n\nThe author is asking if they are the asshole (AITA). The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFrom what I understand, the key issue is whether the boyfriend was inconsiderate by not helping when the author's dad was doing the work. Typically, when someone comes to help, especially with a messy task, it's considered polite to at least assist. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he didn't help because he disagreed with the method his partner's dad was using. But his justification seems weak. Disagreeing with the method doesn't mean he can't acknowledge the help or participate in making things easier for the helper. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend said he wouldn't help if things went wrong, which is a red flag. Then when the dad arrived, he didn't even try to help, which is seen as ungrateful and inconsiderate. The author's dad was working hard in a difficult situation, and the boyfriend's lack of assistance would be seen as disrespectful by many people. \n\nThe author's expectations might be reasonable. Common courtesy usually involves showing appreciation and helping out when someone comes over to assist with a problem. The boyfriend's behavior could be seen as dismissive and not valuing the help provided. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong; the boyfriend is. So the answer should be B.\n"
