I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a couple dealing with a clogged toilet. The boyfriend was unhelpful, lying down while the author and her dad worked on fixing it. The author is upset because the BF didn't contribute and was rude to her dad. The BF claims he did nothing wrong and that she's the one at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The toilet was clogged for days, which is a big problem, especially in a small apartment with no other bathroom. The BF tried for an hour, then the author tried for two more hours. When her dad came, the BF just laid down and didn't help. The dad worked for three hours, and the BF was uncooperative, even making a big deal about the dad needing clean clothes. The BF's reasoning is that he thought it wasn't urgent, didn't agree with how the dad was fixing it, and that the author should be grateful he let her dad in.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLooking at the situation, the BF didn't help during the problem. When the author's dad came, he didn't assist but instead laid down. The BF's attitude seems dismissive and ungrateful. The author is upset because she expected her BF to contribute, especially since they live together. The BF's argument that he thought it wasn't urgent is weak because the toilet wasn't working for days. Also, when the dad was helping, the BF's lack of cooperation led to the dad being angry. \n\nCommon courtesy would suggest that the BF should have helped or at least shown respect to the author's dad. The BF's behavior seems inconsiderate. The author isn't wrong for expecting her partner to be helpful and respectful in a situation where they were both affected by the problem. The BF's reasoning doesn't hold up because he had a responsibility to contribute to fixing the issue in their shared home. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
