I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The situation is that the author's boyfriend didn't help when their toilet was clogged and instead just lay around while the author's dad fixed it. The boyfriend is upset about the dad needing shorts and thinks he did nothing wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out who's at fault here. The author's BF wasn't helping with unclogging the toilet. The author tried, bought tools, and even tried for hours. Then when the dad came, the BF was just lying down. The dad worked for three hours, and the BF didn't contribute. The BF's reasoning is that he didn't want to help because he disagreed with the method the dad used. But that seems like an invalid reason. If someone is trying to help, you don't just lie down and not assist just because you disagree with their method. Also, the BF didn't help clean up or support the author during the process. \n\nThe BF also said he wouldn't help if things went wrong, which is a red flag. That's not supportive behavior. The author's dad was upset because the BF didn't do anything, and the author is upset. The BF doesn't see that he should be grateful. So, in terms of common courtesy, the BF failed. The author wasn't wrong to expect some help or at least basic respect towards the person helping them. \n\nThe BF's arguments seem selfish. He should have at least assisted, regardless of his opinion on the method. Since the problem was urgent and they needed the toilet to work, contributing would have been necessary. The fact that the BF didn't help and then was annoyed at the dad's situation shows a lack of consideration. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here. The BF is the one who should have shown more responsibility and gratitude.\n"
