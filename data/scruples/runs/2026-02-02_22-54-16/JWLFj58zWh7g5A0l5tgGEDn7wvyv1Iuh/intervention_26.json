I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the AITA post) is in the wrong based on the situation described. The situation involves the boyfriend's reaction while the author's dad fixed a clogged toilet.\n\nFirst, the key points: The toilet was clogged, they tried to fix it themselves but failed. The author's dad came over to help. The boyfriend was lying down during the entire process. After the dad fixed it, the boyfriend was ungrateful and even upset that the dad needed to take a shower and ask for shorts. The boyfriend claims it wasn't urgent and didn't want to help because he disagreed with the dad's method.\n\nThe author feels that the boyfriend should have been more helpful and respectful towards the dad who did the work. The boyfriend, on the other hand, thinks he did nothing wrong, letting the dad fix it and not helping. The author's dad is now upset and doesn't want to talk to the boyfriend.\n\nNow, considering social norms of gratitude and respect. When someone helps you, especially in a physically demanding and unpleasant task like unclogging a toilet, it's expected to show appreciation. The boyfriend's inaction and lack of support (lying down, not helping) could be seen as disrespectful. The dad did the work, and the boyfriend's attitude might have made the situation uncomfortable for the author.\n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning that it wasn't urgent is questionable because the toilet wasn't working for two days, which would be a problem in a small apartment with no alternative bathroom. His claim that he disagreed with the dad's method could be a justification for not helping, but that doesn't negate the expected respect towards the dad who was trying to assist.\n\nThe author's perspective is that their boyfriend's behavior was inconsiderate and ungrateful. The boyfriend's behavior might have crossed a line by not showing any effort or gratitude during a task that required help. The author's dad felt disrespected, which is a valid reaction.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong for expecting gratitude from her boyfriend. The boyfriend's actions (or inactions) led to the conflict. The author's dad did the work, so the boyfriend's lack of response is the main issue here. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
