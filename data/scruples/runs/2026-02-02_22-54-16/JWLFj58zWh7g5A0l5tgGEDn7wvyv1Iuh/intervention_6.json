I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a boyfriend who didn't help when the toilet was clogged and then acted ungrateful when the author's dad came to fix it. The author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for being upset.\n\nFirst, the toilet clogged, and the boyfriend tried for an hour but then the author took over. After two hours, they called the author's dad. When the dad arrived, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't help during the three hours of work. The dad was angry because the BF didn't do anything, and the BF's reasoning is that it wasn't a big deal and he didn't help because he disagreed with the method.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did the BF act inconsiderately? When a guest (the dad) comes to help, the BF didn't offer assistance, stayed passive. In most social norms, when someone comes to help fix an urgent problem, the host should at least be present and offer to help, even if they can't do the task. The BF's attitude seems dismissive and ungrateful. The author is upset because the BF didn't show appreciation or help, which is a valid reaction.\n\nThe BF's argument that it's not a big deal is questionable. A non-working toilet is a major issue, especially in a small apartment with no alternative. Also, the BF's refusal to help after the dad arrived seems disrespectful. The dad was cleaning up a messy, disgusting situation, and the BF didn't even offer to assist. The BF's claim that he disagreed with the method is a weak excuse and doesn't justify his behavior.\n\nThe author's expectation of common courtesy is reasonable. The BF's actions (laying down, not helping, being ungrateful) are inconsiderate. The dad's anger is understandable. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The BF's behavior was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
