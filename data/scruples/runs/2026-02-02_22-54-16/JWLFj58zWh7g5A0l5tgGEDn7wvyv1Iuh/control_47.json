I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person posting the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves a toilet clog that both the author and her boyfriend tried to fix, but after several hours, she called her dad. The boyfriend was lying down while her dad worked, and he didn't help. The dad got angry, and now the boyfriend is saying the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The couple has been together for four years and live in a 40 m\u00b2 apartment with no other bathroom. The toilet was completely clogged, which would be a big deal because they can't flush. The boyfriend tried for an hour, then she tried for two more. She asked to call her dad, he agreed but gave a red flag about not helping if things went wrong. Then when her dad arrived, the boyfriend just laid down and didn't help. The dad fixed it over three hours, and the dad was upset because the boyfriend did nothing. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he should be grateful he let her call her dad, and it wasn't a big deal, and he disagreed with the dad's method.\n\nSo, the key points here are: The boyfriend didn't help during the dad's efforts, even though the problem was causing a mess in their small apartment. The author expected him to assist, but he didn't. The dad did all the work and the boyfriend was unhelpful and maybe even dismissive. The boyfriend's argument is that he didn't do anything wrong because he allowed the call to his dad and didn't like the method. But in social norms, when someone comes to help, the host should be grateful and assist, not lie around.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author wanted the boyfriend to help, but he didn't. The boyfriend's behavior seems inconsiderate. The author is upset because she expected help and common courtesy. The dad did a favor, and the boyfriend didn't reciprocate. The author isn't asking for validation but understanding if she's wrong. \n\nIn such situations, the norm is that when someone offers help, the hosts should be appreciative and assist if possible. The boyfriend's inaction might be seen as rude. The author's expectation of common courtesy is reasonable. The boyfriend's reasoning that it wasn't urgent might be a way to justify his lack of involvement. However, the situation was urgent because they had no working toilet and a mess. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior was inconsiderate, and the author's expectations are reasonable. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
