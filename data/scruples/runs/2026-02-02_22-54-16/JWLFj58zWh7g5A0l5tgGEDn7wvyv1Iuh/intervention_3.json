I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves their boyfriend not helping when a toilet clogged and instead laying down while the author's dad fixed it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's boyfriend tried to unclog it for an hour, then the author tried for two more hours. They went to buy an auger, which shows they made efforts. But when the author's dad came, the boyfriend lay down and didn't help. The dad was angry because the BF didn't contribute, and the BF's reasoning was that it wasn't urgent and he disagreed with the dad's method.\n\nSo, the main points here are about responsibility and respect. In a shared living situation, especially when there's a clogged toilet next to the bed, it's a big inconvenience. The author tried for several hours, and when she asked for her dad's help, the BF didn't assist. Even if he disagreed with the method, he could have at least shown respect by helping or being present. Lying down and doing nothing during such a stressful situation might come off as indifferent or disrespectful.\n\nThe BF's argument that he did nothing wrong because he allowed the author to call her dad is weak. Allowing someone to help isn't the same as being helpful yourself. The dad was doing the work, and the BF's lack of action made the dad feel disrespected. Also, the BF's comment about the dad coming unprepared seems trivial compared to the situation's seriousness.\n\nThe author feels the BF should have been more helpful and respectful. Given the circumstances, expecting some level of support during a crisis is reasonable. The BF's response that it wasn't urgent doesn't hold water when the toilet was completely non-functional, causing a mess and stress.\n\nSo, based on this, the author isn't in the wrong. The BF's behavior was inconsiderate, and the author's feelings of being let down are valid. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
