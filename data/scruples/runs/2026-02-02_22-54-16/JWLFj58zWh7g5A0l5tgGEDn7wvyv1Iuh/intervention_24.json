I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author (the person asking the question) is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a boyfriend who was unhelpful when the toilet clogged, especially when the author's dad came over to fix it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The toilet clogged after the boyfriend had stomach issues. The author and boyfriend tried to fix it without success. They bought an auger, but he tried for an hour and she for two. Then the author asked her dad to come, which the boyfriend agreed to but with a red flag that he wouldn't help if things went wrong. When the dad arrived, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't help. The dad fixed it after three hours, and the boyfriend even got upset when the dad needed clean clothes. Now the dad is angry, and the boyfriend thinks he's not in the wrong.\n\nThe author feels that the boyfriend should have been grateful, but he's not. She's confused because she expects common courtesy. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants to see if others agree.\n\nSo, the question is whether the boyfriend's behavior was acceptable. The user is asking if the author (who is the one complaining) is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe boyfriend didn't help at all during the dad's visit. When someone comes to help fix a toilet, especially when it's a mess, the person should at least be helpful or polite. The boyfriend just lay down and didn't participate. Also, he got annoyed when the dad needed a shower and clothes. That seems disrespectful. The dad worked hard, and expecting gratitude is reasonable. The boyfriend's attitude of not helping and being ungrateful is the issue here. The author isn't in the wrong for expecting her boyfriend to be considerate towards her dad. The boyfriend's reasoning (that it wasn't urgent or his problem) is weak, especially since they were in the middle of dealing with a serious problem in their small apartment with no other bathroom. His behavior was inconsiderate, so the author's side makes sense. Therefore, the answer should be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
