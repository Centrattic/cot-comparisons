I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation involves their boyfriend's behavior when their toilet clogged. The key points here are about responsibility, gratitude, and social etiquette.\n\nFirst, the toilet was clogged, and both the author and boyfriend tried to fix it without success. Then the author called her dad for help. The boyfriend was lying down while the dad worked, which the dad found rude. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he let the dad fix it, so he should be grateful. But the author and her dad expected some level of participation or at least courtesy from the boyfriend.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that he didn't help because he disagreed with how the dad was fixing it. But that's not a valid excuse for not at least being present or showing appreciation. When someone helps you with a significant task, especially something as unpleasant as unclogging a toilet, it's expected to offer help or show gratitude. Lying down and doing nothing while the helper works, especially in the same small apartment, seems inconsiderate. \n\nThe author's perspective is that the boyfriend should have contributed or shown more respect. The boyfriend's attitude of expecting gratitude without contributing might come off as entitled. The dad being angry is understandable because he put in a lot of effort and faced a difficult situation, and the boyfriend didn't support him.\n\nLooking at social norms, when someone does a favor, the host or the person who asked for help should facilitate the process. This includes offering assistance, providing necessary tools, and showing appreciation. The boyfriend's lack of action and his dismissive attitude towards the urgency likely contributed to the conflict.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the boyfriend did try earlier, but when it came time for the dad's help, he didn't contribute. The author was helping, but the boyfriend's absence during the critical part when the dad was working seems like a breach of expected behavior. \n\nSo, considering all this, the boyfriend's actions (or lack thereof) were inconsiderate. The author isn't wrong for expecting her boyfriend to at least help or show some gratitude. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
