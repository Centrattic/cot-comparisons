I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend who didn't help during a toilet clog emergency and instead laid down while the author and her dad dealt with it. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points from the story. The toilet was clogged, and the boyfriend initially tried for an hour, then the author tried for two more hours. They bought an auger, but it didn't work. Then the author's dad came over, but the boyfriend was lying down the whole time, didn't help, and even criticized the dad's method. After the dad fixed it, the boyfriend was annoyed when he had to give him shorts. The dad was upset, and the author is confused because her boyfriend doesn't see the issue.\n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning is that he let the dad fix it, so he should be grateful. But the author feels he should have helped more, especially since they were in a tight living situation. The question is whether she's in the wrong for expecting more from her boyfriend.\n\nFrom a social norms perspective, when someone else does a favor, especially a messy and time-consuming one like fixing a toilet, it's customary to show gratitude and perhaps contribute in some way. The boyfriend didn't help during the process, dismissed the urgency, and was uncooperative. That seems rude. The author and her dad handled the problem, but the boyfriend's lack of assistance could be seen as inconsiderate, especially in a small apartment where the issue affected both of them.\n\nHe tried for an hour, but then stopped and didn't help further. Maybe his contribution wasn't enough. The author tried longer. The boyfriend's attitude towards the dad was poor\u2014lying down, not helping, and later being annoyed about the shorts. The dad was angry, which makes sense given the situation. The boyfriend's justification of not helping because he disagreed with the dad's method seems like an excuse not to engage. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She expected her boyfriend to be helpful and show gratitude, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's behavior was inconsiderate and ungrateful. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
