I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's boyfriend not helping when their toilet was clogged and instead lying down while the author's dad fixed it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The toilet clogged after the boyfriend had stomach issues. The author tried to fix it without success. They bought an auger, the boyfriend tried for an hour, then the author tried for two hours. The boyfriend kept urging her to give up. Then they called the author's dad. When the dad arrived, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't help during the three-hour process. The dad ended up doing all the work, got his clothes dirty, and the boyfriend was upset because the dad needed clean clothes. The boyfriend later claimed it wasn't urgent and that he disagreed with how the dad was fixing it. The author is upset that the BF didn't help and was ungrateful, leading the dad to be angry and not want to talk to him anymore.\n\nNow, the key points here are about responsibility, gratitude, and contribution in a shared living situation. The author and her BF live together, so both should be expected to contribute to household tasks. The toilet issue was significant because it was in a small apartment with no other bathroom. The BF tried for an hour but then didn't help the author for the next two hours. Instead of assisting, he was unhelpful and later ungrateful towards the author's dad who fixed it. \n\nThe BF's reasoning is that he's not in the wrong because he allowed the dad to help, and he thought the situation wasn't urgent. He also claims he disagreed with the dad's method. However, the main issue here is his lack of action. Despite the problem being critical (no bathroom for days), he didn't help after the initial hour. Lying down and not assisting when the author was struggling is a problem. Also, his attitude towards the dad's help was dismissive and ungrateful.\n\nIn a relationship, especially when living together, supporting each other during challenges is important. The BF's inaction and the negative reaction to the dad's help show a lack of consideration and teamwork. The author was trying to resolve the issue and did the right thing by seeking help when they couldn't fix it themselves. The BF's response was not supportive and could be seen as selfish and disrespectful towards both the author and her dad.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. The BF didn't contribute adequately and showed poor gratitude. The answer should be B.\n"
