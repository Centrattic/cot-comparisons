I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation where their boyfriend didn't help with a clogged toilet and was laid back while the author's dad fixed it.\n\nFirst, the problem started with the boyfriend having stomach issues causing the clog. The author tried to unclog it first, then they bought an auger. The boyfriend tried for an hour, the author tried for two more. Then the author asked for their dad's help, and the BF just laid down while the dad worked. The dad was angry because the BF didn't contribute, and the BF claims it wasn't urgent and he disagreed with the dad's method.\n\nSo, the main points here are: Did the BF act disrespectfully or unhelpfully? The author's dad worked hard, was covered in mess, had to borrow clothes, and the BF didn't participate. The BF's reasoning is that he didn't help because he didn't like how the dad was fixing it and thought it wasn't urgent. But the author was suffering from the clogged toilet, and the BF didn't offer any support. \n\nFrom a common courtesy standpoint, when someone helps you out, especially in a difficult situation, you're supposed to be helpful and respectful. The BF's inaction and being laid back while the dad worked might be seen as ungrateful or not contributing. The fact that they live together and the problem was causing a major inconvenience (no bathroom, etc.) adds to the expectation that the BF should help. \n\nThe BF's argument that it wasn't urgent is weak because the toilet wasn't flushing at all, and they had no other bathroom. His disagreement with the method doesn't justify not helping. Maybe he could have communicated concerns, but not helping at all is inconsiderate. \n\nThe author's dad was clearly upset, and the author is conflicted. The BF's attitude might be the issue here, not the author. So, the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong. The BF should have at least tried to assist or be respectful while the dad was working.\n"
