I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a clogged toilet that the boyfriend and the author tried to fix. The boyfriend was lying down while the author's dad came to help. The dad was working on it for three hours, and the boyfriend didn't help. The dad got upset because the boyfriend was unhelpful, and now the boyfriend is saying that the author should be grateful he let the dad fix it and that it wasn't such a big deal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's expected in such situations. When someone helps out, especially with something as unpleasant as unclogging a toilet, there's usually an expectation of politeness and at least some level of participation or respect from the person being helped. The boyfriend not only didn't help but was lying down, which seems dismissive. That's a red flag. \n\nThe author mentions that the boyfriend was already annoyed when they bought the tool and then urged her to give up when she tried. So maybe he wasn't cooperative from the start. When the dad came over, the boyfriend didn't even get up to greet him properly. That's pretty inconsiderate. \n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning is that he let the dad fix it, but that's not really being helpful. Letting someone do the work doesn't make up for not contributing anything. The dad's reaction makes sense because he was doing a favor and the boyfriend didn't show appreciation. The author is upset because she expected basic courtesy. \n\nThe key factors here are respect for the helper (the dad) and participation in solving the problem. The boyfriend didn't do either. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior was inconsiderate, and the author's expectations are reasonable. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
