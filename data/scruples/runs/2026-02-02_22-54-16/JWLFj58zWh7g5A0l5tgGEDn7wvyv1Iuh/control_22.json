I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend who didn't help when the toilet was clogged and instead lay down while the author's dad fixed it. The boyfriend's response was that he didn't do anything wrong and the author is asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The toilet was clogged for a couple of days. The boyfriend tried for an hour, then the author tried for two more hours. They bought an auger. The boyfriend was annoyed when buying the tool. When the dad came over, the boyfriend lay down and didn't help. The dad did all the work, which was quite disgusting. The boyfriend didn't even offer to help or show gratitude. His reasoning was that he didn't agree with how the dad was fixing it and that he didn't do anything wrong. The dad got angry, and the author is upset too.\n\nNow, considering social norms and relationships. In a partnership, especially when living together, mutual support is expected. The boyfriend tried initially but then stopped and didn't help when the author's dad was there. Lying down during such a messy situation might come off as dismissive or disrespectful. The dad was doing a favor, so the least the boyfriend could do is be present, offer help, or show some appreciation. His lack of action and the comment about disagreeing with the method seems like an excuse not to engage. The author feels that basic courtesy was lacking, which is a valid expectation. The boyfriend's attitude might be seen as selfish or inconsiderate, especially when the problem was urgent and affecting their living conditions. The dad's anger makes sense because he was put in a difficult situation without support from the boyfriend. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior was inconsiderate. The answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
