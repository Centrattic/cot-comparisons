I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong. The situation involves a clogged toilet that they tried to fix with their boyfriend, but he ended up not helping when their dad came to fix it. The boyfriend was lying down while the author's dad worked, which upset both the author and her dad.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The toilet was clogged for two days, causing inconvenience. They bought an auger, tried themselves but failed. Then when the author's dad came to help, the boyfriend was uncooperative, lying down instead of assisting. The dad was angry, and the boyfriend's reasoning was that he didn't agree with the dad's method and thought the author should be grateful he allowed the dad to fix it.\n\nThe author feels that the boyfriend should have shown more gratitude and help, while the boyfriend sees it as the author being too demanding. The question is about whether the author is wrong in her expectations.\n\nCommon courtesy in such situations usually involves showing appreciation to someone who helps you, especially when they do a physically demanding and unpleasant task like fixing a clogged toilet. The boyfriend's lack of help and dismissive attitude towards the dad's efforts would likely be seen as disrespectful or inconsiderate. The fact that the dad was doing a favor and the boyfriend didn't contribute further, even after the dad worked for three hours, seems to support the author's perspective.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument that it wasn't urgent is questionable because the toilet was non-functional for two days, which is a significant issue. Also, disagreeing with the dad's method doesn't justify not helping or being ungrateful. The dad was there to help, and the boyfriend's response was to be uncooperative and even reluctant to provide basic items like clean clothes after the dad got dirty.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's expectations of gratitude and help from her boyfriend seem reasonable. The boyfriend's behavior and reasoning don't align with typical social norms of appreciation and cooperation. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
