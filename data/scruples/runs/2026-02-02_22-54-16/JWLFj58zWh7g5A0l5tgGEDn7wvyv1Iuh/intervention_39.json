I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a boyfriend who didn't help when their toilet was clogged, and the author's dad had to come over and fix it while the boyfriend was lying down the whole time. The boyfriend is defending his inaction.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The toilet clogged after the boyfriend had stomach issues. The author tried first, then they bought an auger. He tried for an hour, then she tried for two hours. When they called the author's dad, the boyfriend was unhelpful, lying down, and even got annoyed when the dad needed clean clothes. The dad got angry, and the boyfriend's reasoning is that he didn't have to help and thought it wasn't urgent.\n\nSo the main issue is about the boyfriend's lack of participation and respect towards the author's dad. The author feels the boyfriend should have been more helpful and respectful. The boyfriend's defense is that he allowed the dad to help, which he says is enough, but the author disagrees.\n\nNow, considering social norms, when someone comes to help, especially a guest, the host should be at least present and offer help. Lying down and not assisting, even if not physically required, can be seen as disrespectful. The boyfriend's attitude of not helping and being dismissive about the urgency shows a lack of consideration for the author's situation. The author's dad worked hard in unpleasant conditions, and the boyfriend's inaction and attitude would likely offend anyone. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument that it wasn't urgent is weak because the toilet wasn't working for days, causing discomfort. The author had to handle it for hours, so it was indeed urgent. The boyfriend's refusal to participate further adds to the problem. The dad's anger is justified given the circumstances.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend failed to meet basic expectations of helpfulness and respect in this situation. So the answer should be B.\n"
