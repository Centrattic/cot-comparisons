I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a clogged toilet in a small apartment where the boyfriend was lying down while the author and her dad tried to fix it. The boyfriend didn't help and even told the author he wouldn't help if things went wrong. He later didn't want to take the shorts from the author's dad, who then got angry.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the boyfriend's actions were appropriate. The key points here are about responsibility in a shared living situation and basic courtesy. The toilet was clogged for two days, which is a significant inconvenience, especially in a small place with no other bathroom. The boyfriend tried for an hour but then urged the author to give up. Then, when the author's dad came over, the boyfriend was lying down and uncooperative. \n\nThe author feels wronged because her boyfriend didn't help and showed disrespect towards her dad. The boyfriend's reasoning is that the author should be grateful he let her dad fix it, that it wasn't urgent, and that he disagreed with her dad's method. But the problem lasted two days, leading to a pool of waste, which is clearly a big deal. \n\nIn a relationship, especially living together, both partners should contribute to solving such issues. The boyfriend's refusal to help or even assist in a respectful way towards the author's dad is a problem. Not helping with a household emergency is one thing, but being uncooperative and showing no respect is another. The author's dad was trying to help, and the boyfriend's attitude likely made him feel undervalued and disrespected. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for expecting her boyfriend to help and to show basic courtesy to her family. The boyfriend's actions and attitude are the main issues here. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
