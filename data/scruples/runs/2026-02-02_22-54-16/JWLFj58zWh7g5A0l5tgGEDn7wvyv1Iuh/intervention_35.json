I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario involves a couple dealing with a clogged toilet. The boyfriend's behavior is in question, particularly his attitude when the author's dad helped fix it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The toilet was clogged for two days. The boyfriend tried for an hour, then the author tried for two more hours. They had no other bathroom, so the problem was urgent. When the author's dad came over, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't help. He even refused to help if things went wrong. The dad worked for three hours, cleaned up the mess, and the boyfriend was uncooperative. The dad got angry, and the boyfriend claims the author should be grateful he allowed the dad to help, saying it wasn't such a big deal.\n\nThe author feels the boyfriend should have been more helpful and showed gratitude. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he didn't do anything because he disagreed with the dad's method and that the situation wasn't urgent. \n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The question is about whether the boyfriend's behavior was wrong. Common courtesy and expectations in such situations might suggest that the boyfriend should have contributed or at least been considerate. However, the boyfriend's argument is that he was uninvolved and didn't want to interfere with the dad's method. But given the context of the toilet being a critical issue in a small apartment, the boyfriend's lack of action and his attitude when the dad was helping could be seen as rude or inconsiderate.\n\nThe author isn't asking if the boyfriend is wrong, but if the author is in the wrong. The author called her dad for help, which is understandable given the situation. The boyfriend's reaction to the dad's help and his lack of assistance might not make the author at fault. The author's expectations of gratitude and common courtesy seem reasonable. The boyfriend's refusal to help and his dismissive attitude could be the main issues here. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. \n\nPossible counterpoints: Maybe the boyfriend was trying to avoid making things worse by not interfering with the dad's method. But in that case, being at least present and helpful in other ways (like cleaning up, offering assistance, or showing respect) would be expected. Lying down and doing nothing, especially in a stressful situation where help was coming, is likely to be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
