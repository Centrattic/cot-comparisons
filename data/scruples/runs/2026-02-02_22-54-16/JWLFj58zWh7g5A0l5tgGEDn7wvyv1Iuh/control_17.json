I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a couple dealing with a clogged toilet. The boyfriend was unhelpful during the process and then didn't even get up when the author's dad arrived to help. The author is upset, and her dad is angry at the boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The main points are:\n\n1. The toilet was clogged for a few days, causing a mess and inconvenience.\n2. The boyfriend tried for an hour, then urged the author to give up. She tried for two more hours.\n3. They decided to call the author's dad. The boyfriend agreed but had a red flag comment about not helping if things went wrong.\n4. When the dad arrived, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't help, even though the dad worked for three hours with the author helping. The dad then had to shower and ask for clean clothes, which the boyfriend took issue with.\n5. The boyfriend's reasoning is that the author should be grateful he let her dad fix it, and he thought it wasn't urgent. He didn't want to help because he disagreed with the dad's method.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for being upset. \n\nFrom the boyfriend's perspective, he might feel he tried for an hour, which isn't bad, and then allowed her to get help. He might see his role as not having to be involved once they brought in someone else. But the key points here are about effort and respect.\n\nThe author was dealing with a serious problem\u2014no functioning toilet, a mess, and the dad had to handle a very unpleasant situation. The boyfriend's lack of action and his dismissive attitude towards the problem (calling it not urgent) might come off as inconsiderate.\n\nAlso, when the dad was working, the boyfriend was laid back and didn't even get up to greet him. That's a social norm issue\u2014when someone comes to help, it's customary to be polite and offer assistance, even if you're not the one doing the work. The dad was helping, so expecting some level of gratitude and respect from the boyfriend is reasonable.\n\nThe boyfriend's attitude of not helping and being annoyed that the dad needed clean clothes seems selfish and ungrateful. The red flag comment about not helping if things went wrong is also problematic. It sounds like he was setting the author up for failure and then not supporting her when the problem escalated.\n\nThe author's dad is upset because he did all the work and the boyfriend didn't contribute. The author feels wronged because she expected her boyfriend to be respectful and helpful, especially in a crisis. \n\nIn relationships, mutual support is important. The boyfriend's actions here might be seen as lacking in that support. The author isn't wrong in expecting her partner to be respectful towards the person helping them, even if he didn't do the work himself. So the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
