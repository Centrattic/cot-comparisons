I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation where her boyfriend didn't help during a toilet clog emergency and instead laid down while her dad worked. \n\nFirst, the problem started with a clogged toilet. The boyfriend tried for an hour, then the author tried for two hours, both without success. The author then called her dad for help. The boyfriend agreed but had a red flag comment about not helping if things went wrong. When the dad arrived, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't assist, even as the dad worked for three hours. The dad was upset, and the boyfriend blamed the author for overreacting and not being grateful.\n\nThe key points here are about responsibility and respect. When someone does a favor, especially a messy and time-consuming one like fixing a toilet, it's customary to show appreciation and at least offer assistance. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014lacking help, lying down, not showing gratitude\u2014seems dismissive. The author and her dad were working hard, and his attitude probably felt disrespectful. \n\nThe boyfriend's excuse that he didn't think it was urgent or that he disagreed with the method doesn't hold much weight when the situation was clearly problematic (no toilet for two days, a small apartment, etc.). His lack of involvement despite the effort from others suggests he's in the wrong. The author's expectation of common courtesy is reasonable. \n\nSo, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). The boyfriend failed to meet basic expectations of respect and participation in an emergency situation.\n"
