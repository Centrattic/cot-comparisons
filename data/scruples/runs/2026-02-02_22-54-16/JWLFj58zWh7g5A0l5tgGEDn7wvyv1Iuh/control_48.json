I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend not helping when their toilet was clogged. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the toilet was clogged after the boyfriend had stomach issues. The author tried to unclog it but failed. They bought an auger, and the boyfriend tried for an hour, then she tried for two more hours. The boyfriend kept telling her to give up. Then she called her dad to help, and when he arrived, the boyfriend was laying down and didn't assist during the three hours her dad worked. The dad got angry because the boyfriend didn't do anything. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he didn't have to help, it wasn't a big deal, and he disagreed with how the dad was fixing it.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The author felt that the boyfriend should have been grateful when her dad helped, especially since he didn't do anything. The boyfriend, on the other hand, claims he didn't do anything wrong, that he let her dad help and that he didn't agree with the method. \n\nHmm. In a relationship, especially when living together, it's expected that both partners contribute to solving problems. The toilet was a major issue affecting their home, so it's reasonable for the boyfriend to help. Lying down while a parent of his partner is dealing with the problem, especially in such a messy situation, seems inconsiderate. The boyfriend didn't contribute, didn't support his partner, and even had a negative reaction to the dad's help. His attitude of dismissing the problem and not helping seems to be the issue here. The author isn't in the wrong for expecting some effort from her boyfriend. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
