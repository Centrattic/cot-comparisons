I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple dealing with a clogged toilet. The boyfriend was unwell, they tried to unclog it themselves, but it got bad. Then the author called her dad, who fixed it, but the boyfriend was lying down the whole time and didn't help. Now the dad is upset, and the author is confused because her boyfriend claims he did nothing wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out who's at fault here. The author's main issue is that her boyfriend didn't help during the toilet crisis and was ungrateful when her dad came in. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he wasn't obligated to help and that the situation wasn't urgent, plus he disagreed with the method her dad used. \n\nSo, the apartment is small, no other bathroom, and the toilet was completely clogged. They tried tools, but it's a big mess. The author was exhausted and asked her dad for help, which he provided. The boyfriend's attitude towards her dad is the key problem here. \n\nIn most social norms, when someone helps with a task like fixing a toilet, especially at the request of their partner, a partner should at least show gratitude and maybe offer assistance. Lying down the entire time, even when the helper (the dad) is working, might be seen as inconsiderate or uncooperative. The boyfriend's refusal to help and his attitude towards the dad could be the main issues. \n\nThe author isn't blaming him for not fixing the toilet herself, but for not contributing and not showing courtesy. The boyfriend's argument that it wasn't urgent doesn't make sense because the toilet was non-functional for two days, leading to a significant problem. Also, the fact that he didn't help his partner out of the mess despite her efforts is a point against him. \n\nThe dad's reaction might be harsh, but if he was unprepared, maybe that's a separate issue. The boyfriend's behavior in not assisting and being ungrateful is likely the main problem here. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the boyfriend didn't help and was ungrateful when the dad fixed it. The author's expectations of common courtesy are reasonable.\n"
