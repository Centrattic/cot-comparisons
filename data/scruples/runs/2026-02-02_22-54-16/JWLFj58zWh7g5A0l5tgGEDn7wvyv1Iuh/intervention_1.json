I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong in their situation with their boyfriend. \n\nThe situation involves a clogged toilet that the boyfriend and author tried to fix. The boyfriend tried for an hour, then the author tried for two more hours. When the author asked her dad to help, the boyfriend was okay but didn't help. Then, when the dad arrived, the boyfriend was lying down the whole time. The dad fixed it, and the boyfriend was annoyed when the dad needed clean clothes. The boyfriend's reasoning is that the author should be grateful he let her dad fix it and that he thought it wasn't urgent. The author feels that common courtesy was lacking and the dad is upset.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author in the wrong here?\n\nFirst, I need to consider expectations in relationships. When someone helps you, especially in a situation involving family, there's usually an expectation of respect. The boyfriend didn't contribute, wasn't helpful, and was dismissive. Lying down while a family member of his partner is working on a toilet clog seems disrespectful. The dad worked for three hours, and the boyfriend's reaction to needing clean clothes could be seen as ungrateful.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument that it wasn't urgent is questionable. The toilet was clogged for days, so it was an urgent issue. Also, the boyfriend tried to fix it for an hour, but the author tried for two more. Maybe he gave up too soon, but that's a different point. The key point is the lack of respect and help towards the author's dad, which caused the dad to be upset.\n\nThe author's perspective is that the boyfriend should have shown more respect and gratitude. The boyfriend's reasoning that he's not in the wrong because he allowed the dad to help is flawed. Allowing someone to help isn't the same as showing respect. The boyfriend's inaction and dismissive attitude likely contributed to the problem.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. The boyfriend's behavior was disrespectful and uncooperative. The answer should be B (No).\n"
