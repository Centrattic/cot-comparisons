I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong. The situation involves their boyfriend not helping when their toilet was clogged and the boyfriend's reaction when the author's dad came to fix it.\n\nFirst, the toilet was clogged after the boyfriend had stomach issues. The author tried to fix it first, then they bought an auger. The boyfriend tried for an hour, then the author tried for two more hours. When the problem wasn't solved, the author called her dad. The boyfriend agreed but was laid back. When the dad arrived, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't help. The dad fixed it in three hours while the author helped. The dad was upset because the boyfriend didn't contribute, and the boyfriend later claimed it wasn't urgent and that he disagreed with the dad's method. Now, the dad is angry and won't speak to him.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nTo determine this, we need to assess the boyfriend's behavior. The main points are: refusing to help during the clog, being uncooperative when the author's dad came, and not showing gratitude. Social expectations usually require contributing when a problem affects the household, especially when it's a hygiene issue. The boyfriend's argument that he didn't have to help seems dismissive. The dad did a favor, and the boyfriend's lack of help or respect might be inconsiderate. The author's frustration is justified because teamwork and gratitude are expected in such situations. The boyfriend's stance might stem from a lack of empathy or different expectations, but that doesn't make him right. The author isn't wrong for expecting common courtesy. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
