I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author's boyfriend was supposed to help unclog the toilet but ended up lying down while her dad did all the work. The BF claims he's not at fault, saying the author should be grateful he allowed her dad to fix it. The author is upset because her BF didn't contribute and even acted annoyed.\n\nFirst, when someone helps you, especially in a messy situation like this, it's customary to show gratitude. The BF didn't help at all, which seems disrespectful. He also didn't support the author during the process, even telling her to give up. The dad was there for three hours, cleaned up the mess, and the BF didn't offer help. That's a big red flag.\n\nThe BF's reasoning that it wasn't urgent or a big deal doesn't hold water because they had been dealing with a non-working toilet for days. The apartment's size and lack of another bathroom added urgency. Also, when the dad was working, the BF didn't even sit up. That's just rude. The dad was cleaning up after him and his own daughter's efforts, and the BF acted annoyed when the dad needed clean clothes.\n\nThe key points are about respect and contribution. The BF didn't contribute, showed no respect for the situation or the helpers, and dismissed the problem's urgency. The author is not in the wrong for expecting basic courtesy and help from her partner. The BF's behavior was inconsiderate and unhelpful. So, the answer is B (author not in the wrong).\n"
