I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the boyfriend not helping when a toilet clogged and instead lying down while the author's dad fixed it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The toilet was clogged after the boyfriend had stomach issues. The author tried first, then the boyfriend tried for an hour, then the author tried for two more hours. They bought tools, but nothing worked. Then they called the author's dad, who fixed it. The boyfriend was lying down the whole time while the dad worked. The dad was upset because the boyfriend didn't help, and the author is upset too.\n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning is that he thinks the author should be grateful he allowed the dad to help, and he didn't see it as urgent. He also said he didn't agree with the dad's method, so he did nothing. The author feels the boyfriend should have been more helpful and showed basic courtesy.\n\nNow, considering social norms and expectations in relationships. When someone helps you, especially in a situation like this, it's customary to show appreciation. Lying down while someone is working on fixing a toilet might be seen as inconsiderate. The boyfriend didn't help, didn't acknowledge the dad's efforts, and even criticized the method. That's a problem.\n\nThe author's dad was angry, which indicates that the boyfriend's behavior crossed a line. Also, the author tried for several hours before getting help, which shows they were trying to resolve the issue themselves. The boyfriend's lack of support during the entire process, including during the dad's help, seems to be an issue.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend might argue that he tried to help before, but maybe he was frustrated. But even if he had disagreements with the method, he could have at least been polite and helped in some way. Not helping and lying down doesn't seem acceptable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong here. The boyfriend's lack of assistance and inconsiderate behavior is the main issue. The author's expectations of basic courtesy are reasonable. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
