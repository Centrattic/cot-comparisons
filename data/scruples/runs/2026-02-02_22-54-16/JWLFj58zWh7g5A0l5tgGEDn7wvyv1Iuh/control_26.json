I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the AITA scenario) is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the key points: The toilet was clogged for a few days. The boyfriend tried for an hour, then the author tried for two hours. When the author's dad came to help, the boyfriend was lounging the whole time. The dad fixed the toilet, but the boyfriend didn't help, and even seemed annoyed when the dad needed to take a shower and borrow clothes. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he didn't have to help and that the situation wasn't urgent. The author feels he should have been grateful and helped, but he isn't and their dad is upset.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong (option A) or not (option B). The question is whether the author's expectations are unreasonable.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions: He didn't help during the dad's three-hour effort. Even if he was tired or disagreed with the method, common courtesy would suggest showing some level of assistance or at least respect. The dad was doing a favor, which is a big deal given the circumstances (disgusting clog, no other bathroom). The boyfriend's lack of support and his dismissive attitude towards the dad's help could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nThe author's perspective: They expected gratitude and some help from the boyfriend, especially since it was a difficult task. The boyfriend's refusal to assist and his attitude led to the dad being upset. The author's frustration is understandable, as they were dealing with a messy, urgent problem.\n\nPossible angles to consider: Was the boyfriend justified in not helping? Maybe if he was extremely tired or had a valid reason, but the scenario doesn't mention that. Also, the boyfriend tried earlier, but after the dad arrived, he didn't contribute. The dad was doing a favor, so the least the boyfriend could do is respect him. The author isn't asking for validation but understanding if their expectations are unreasonable.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at social norms. Common courtesy usually dictates that when someone helps you, you should be grateful and offer assistance. The boyfriend's inaction might be seen as a breach of that norm. The author isn't wrong for expecting this. The boyfriend's reasoning that he didn't have to help might be his opinion, but socially, he's probably at fault here.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
