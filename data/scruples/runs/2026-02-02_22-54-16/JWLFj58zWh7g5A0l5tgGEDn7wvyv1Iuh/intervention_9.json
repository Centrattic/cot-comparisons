I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend who didn't help when the toilet clogged and instead laid down while the author's dad fixed it. The boyfriend later criticized the dad for not being prepared, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The toilet was clogged for two days, causing significant inconvenience. The boyfriend tried for an hour, then the author tried for two more hours without success. They called the author's dad. The boyfriend was lying down during the dad's attempt and then complained about the dad's preparedness. The dad was upset because the BF didn't help at all.\n\nCommon courtesy would suggest that when someone comes to help, the person being helped should show appreciation and maybe offer assistance. The BF's behavior of not helping and then criticizing seems inconsiderate. The author's dad did the work, which is a significant favor, especially in a small apartment with no other bathroom. The BF's reasoning that he didn't have to help because he disagreed with the dad's method doesn't seem valid. Disagreeing doesn't mean you shouldn't at least be polite or assist.\n\nThe author is upset because they expected gratitude and basic respect from their BF. The BF dismissing the urgency and the effort of the dad seems unreasonable. The fact that the BF didn't contribute and then complained about the dad's situation (like needing shorts) further shows a lack of consideration. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. The BF's actions and attitude were inappropriate. The answer should be B.\n"
