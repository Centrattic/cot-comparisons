I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA story) is in the wrong based on the situation described. The key points here are about the boyfriend's behavior during the toilet clog incident.\n\nFirst, the toilet clogged after the boyfriend had stomach issues. The author tried to unclog it, then they bought an auger. The boyfriend tried for an hour, then the author tried for two more hours. The boyfriend was urging her to give up. When her dad came to help, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't assist, which upset both the author and her dad. The boyfriend later claimed it wasn't urgent and that he disagreed with how the dad fixed it. He also refused to provide clean clothes, leading to further conflict.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The options are A for yes, she's wrong, or B for no. Let's analyze. The boyfriend didn't help during the clog fixing. When the author's dad came over to help, the boyfriend didn't participate and was dismissive. The author and her dad expected some level of participation or at least courtesy. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he should be grateful he let the dad fix it, but the author and her dad feel he should have contributed more.\n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone helps you, especially with a task that's unpleasant and physically demanding, it's customary to offer assistance, at least show respect, and provide basic courtesy. The boyfriend's inaction and dismissive attitude could be seen as lacking in these areas. The fact that he was lying down during the entire process while his partner and her dad were working hard adds to the perception that he didn't care about contributing.\n\nThe author might be in the right because the boyfriend didn't meet basic expectations of helpfulness and respect in a situation that required teamwork. The boyfriend's claim that it wasn't urgent or important might be a way to justify his inaction, but the situation clearly was urgent for the author. The boyfriend's refusal to help and his negative reaction to the dad's request for clean clothes could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend might argue that he was just trying to conserve energy or that he didn't agree with the method used. But in a crisis situation where both partners are supposed to work together, not contributing and not showing respect to a helper is problematic. The boyfriend's behavior led to a breakdown in the relationship with the author and her family, which is a significant consequence.\n\nSo considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions lacked the necessary support and respect expected in such a scenario. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
