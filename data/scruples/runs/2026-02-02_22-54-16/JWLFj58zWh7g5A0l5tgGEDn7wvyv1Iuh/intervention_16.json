I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation with her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the key points: The toilet clogged after the boyfriend had stomach issues. The author tried for hours to unclog it, then they bought an auger. The boyfriend tried for an hour, then the author tried for two more hours. She asked to call her dad, he agreed but said he wouldn't help if things went wrong. When the dad arrived, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't help. The dad fixed it and was upset because the BF didn't assist. The BF's reasoning is that he didn't have to help and even disagreed with the dad's method. The author feels he should have been grateful and helped.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the BF did something wrong by not helping. The author is frustrated that her BF didn't contribute, even though he agreed to let the dad help. The BF doesn't see it as a big deal and claims it's not urgent. \n\nIn terms of responsibility in a relationship, especially when living together, it's reasonable to expect mutual support. The BF did try initially but then stopped. When the dad came, he didn't help, which could be seen as disrespectful. The dad did the work, and the BF's lack of assistance might come off as ungrateful or indifferent. \n\nThe BF's argument that he didn't have to help might be valid in a way, but in a relationship, especially when living together, there's an unspoken expectation to pitch in, especially when a third party is involved doing the work. The BF's attitude could be seen as dismissive of the problem's urgency and the effort the dad put in. \n\nThe dad being angry is understandable because he's helping a family member and the BF's inaction might have made him feel unwelcome or unappreciated. The author is caught between her BF and her dad, which adds tension. \n\nSo, considering all that, the BF's behavior seems inconsiderate. The author isn't in the wrong for expecting her BF to show some support and gratitude. It's reasonable to expect that when someone helps you, especially in a messy situation, you acknowledge their effort and assist as much as possible. The BF's lack of action and his dismissiveness contribute to the problem. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
