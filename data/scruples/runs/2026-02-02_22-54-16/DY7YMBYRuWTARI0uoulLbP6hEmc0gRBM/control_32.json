So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a high school student who reported others vaping in the bathroom, leading to multiple suspensions and one expulsion.\n\nFirst, the school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author is frustrated because they now have to walk farther. Then, they see a group of freshmen vaping in the other bathroom and report them. The author didn't do anything illegal, just informed the resource officer. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points to consider: the author's intention was to address the problem they were upset about. They didn't directly harm the students, just reported the illegal activity. However, the consequences were severe\u2014suspensions and expulsion. \n\nBut the school's rules probably prohibit vaping on school grounds. The author is following the rules by reporting it. The issue might be whether ratting out peers is considered wrong in this context. Some might argue that the author is taking the law into their own hands, but technically, they're just reporting a violation. On the other hand, the author might not have known the extent of the consequences, like the expulsion. \n\nThe moral dilemma here is between standing against rule-breaking and the harsh consequences on minors. The author feels bad because the students are young, but they still took action because they believed the school wasn't doing enough. In terms of being in the wrong, legally and according to school policy, the author did the right thing. Morally, it's debatable, but the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since the action aligns with school rules and the author didn't act maliciously, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
