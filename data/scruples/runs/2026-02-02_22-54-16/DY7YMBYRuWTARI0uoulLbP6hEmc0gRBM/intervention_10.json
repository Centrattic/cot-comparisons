So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the school closed a restroom because kids were vaping there. The author found another group of kids vaping in a different restroom and reported them, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The author is upset because the kids are freshmen, around 14-15, and maybe feels bad about their actions.\n\nFirst, the school's decision to close the bathroom instead of punishing the students is a bit iffy. Maybe they wanted to avoid harsh discipline but it didn't solve the problem. The author, frustrated by having to walk farther to use the bathroom, saw others vaping again. The key point here is that the author reported the violation. Now, is reporting an illegal activity (since vaping in school is against the rules) wrong? Legally, maybe not. But ethically, it's a gray area. The author might have felt justified in stopping the others because the school didn't address the issue effectively. However, the author didn't try to talk to the kids or get an adult first. They just went straight to the resource officer, which might have led to harsh consequences without considering other options. Also, the author mentions not having a problem with vaping itself but the kids doing it to impress peers. So their motivation is more about school rules than the act itself. The fact that one kid was expelled multiple times adds complexity\u2014maybe the system was already failing him. The author's actions might have been a form of vigilante justice, which can be seen as overstepping. But on the other hand, they were trying to enforce school rules. It's a tough call. The answer hinges on whether the author overreacted or just upheld the rules. Since they didn't engage the kids directly first and went straight to reporting, maybe they didn't handle it the best way, but they aren't entirely in the wrong either. The school's approach was flawed, so the author's action might be a response to that. Ultimately, it's a mix of factors. The author isn't in the wrong because the vaping is against school policy, but the method could be questioned. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the answer is B (No), that might be correct because the author is following the rules, even if the outcome is harsh.\n"
