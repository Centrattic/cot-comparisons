So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for getting several kids suspended and one expelled. The situation is that the school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author, frustrated because they now have to walk further for the bathroom, later sees kids vaping in another restroom and tells a school resource officer, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the school's rules and the author's actions. The school had already closed a restroom due to vaping, so they must have a policy against it. The author didn't do anything illegal, just reported what they saw. But they might feel conflicted because the kids are young and maybe they think the punishment is harsh.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The author reported a violation of school rules. 2) The school took disciplinary action. 3) The author feels bad about the consequences, especially since the kids are freshmen. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they followed the rules by reporting the violation. Vaping in school is against policies, so they had a duty to report it. However, their motivation might be questioned\u2014personal frustration about the restroom closure. But even if they were motivated by that, the act of reporting isn't inherently wrong. The school's response is their own decision, so the author isn't responsible for the severity of the punishment beyond their report.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author didn't have the right to report or if they used underhanded methods, but in this case, they just told the resource officer what they saw. So, it's a straightforward report. The author isn't in the wrong because they adhered to the rules and didn't act unlawfully. The school's harsh actions are their own responsibility. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
