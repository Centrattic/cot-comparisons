So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the school closed down a restroom because students were vaping there. The author is upset because they now have to walk farther for the bathroom. Then, when they see a bunch of kids vaping in the other restroom, they tell the resource officer, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nHmm. So, the author's main points are that they were frustrated with the school's action and took it upon themselves to report the vaping incident. But they feel bad because the kids are freshmen, young, and maybe didn't realize the consequences. \n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author did something wrong. Vaping in school is against the rules, right? So if the school has a policy against it, the students are violating it. The author reported the violation, which led to disciplinary actions. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIs it wrong to report illegal or rule-breaking behavior? Usually, people are encouraged to report such things. However, sometimes there's a nuance. If the author is a tattletale or if their actions were malicious, that could be a problem. But the author says they didn't have a problem with vaping itself, just that the students were doing it to impress peers. So maybe their intent was to stop the violation rather than to get others in trouble for personal reasons.\n\nOn the other hand, the outcome was suspensions and an expulsion. The author might feel responsible for the consequences, especially given the age of the kids. But the school's responsibility is to enforce rules, so if the resource officer acted within their authority, the author's report might be justified.\n\nBut wait, the author was frustrated with the school's initial action of closing the restroom instead of addressing the root problem. Maybe that frustration influenced their decision to report, but does that make it wrong? Reporting a rule violation is generally considered right, regardless of personal feelings about the school's previous actions. \n\nAnother angle: the author didn't confront the students themselves but went directly to the officer. Was there an opportunity for a warning or a different approach? The author might have thought that the school wasn't taking the issue seriously before, so they took matters into their own hands. But is that appropriate?\n\nHowever, the school's job is to handle discipline. The author's action might be seen as overstepping, but on the other hand, they were just informing the authorities of a rule violation. The line here is thin. If the author had no malicious intent and was acting in the school's interest, then maybe they're not in the wrong. But if they were acting out of spite or personal inconvenience, that could be different. The author mentions they were upset about having to walk farther, which might have contributed to their decision. \n\nAlso, the fact that the expelled student had been caught multiple times adds context. The school's harsh action might be due to the repeat offense, not just the single incident. So the author's report led to consequences, but the school's policy likely played a role in the expulsion. \n\nIn summary, the author reported a rule violation that they observed. While the consequences were severe, the act of reporting itself isn't inherently wrong. The school's response is their responsibility. Unless the author lied or acted with malicious intent, they might not be in the wrong. However, some might argue that intervening in this way without considering the students' ages or circumstances could be seen as harsh, hence the author might feel conflicted. But legally and ethically, reporting is usually the right action.\n"
