So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a high school student who got multiple kids suspended and one expelled by reporting them for vaping in the restroom. The school had already closed one restroom due to this issue.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is upset because the school closed a restroom, making their daily routine harder. They then see other students vaping in the remaining restroom and report them. The question is whether the author is wrong for doing that.\n\nNow, considering the rules of the school, vaping is against the policy, right? The students were violating the rules, so reporting them might be seen as the right thing. But the author is feeling guilty because the kids are freshmen (14-15 years old) and maybe not fully aware of the consequences.\n\nBut wait, the author's motivation was frustration with the school's decision to close the restroom instead of addressing the root problem. However, the act itself\u2014reporting the students\u2014is technically doing what's right by the school's rules. Even though the author might have been motivated by personal inconvenience, the action itself enforces the rules.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should have tried talking to the students first or reporting the issue to the school in a more formal way instead of directly confronting them. But since the author just informed the resource officer and didn't use force or harsh methods, maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlso, the expelled student had a history of being caught, so the school's action might be appropriate. The author's action led to consequences, but they didn't know about the expelled student beforehand. So, even if they didn't know the history, the act of reporting was still within their right to uphold school policies.\n\nThe key here is whether the author had the right to report the violation. Since vaping is a school rule, and the officer is there to enforce it, the author's action is legitimate. The guilt might come from the outcome, but the act itself isn't wrong. The author isn't in the wrong for following the school rules, even if the outcome seems harsh. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
