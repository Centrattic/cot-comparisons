So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for getting multiple kids suspended and one expelled by reporting vaping in the bathroom. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation clearly. The school closed a restroom because freshmen were vaping there, but the problem continued. The author, frustrated by having to walk across the school, saw more kids vaping in the other bathroom and reported it, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The author feels bad because the kids are young and might not understand the consequences.\n\nNow, the key points here are the legality and the morality. Vaping in school is against policies, so reporting it isn't inherently wrong from a rules standpoint. However, the author's motivation might be a factor. They were upset about the inconvenience of having to use a different bathroom. Was their intent just to enforce the rules, or was there some personal frustration involved?\n\nThe author mentions they don't have an issue with vaping itself but with the students doing it to impress peers. That suggests they might be more concerned about the behavior than the act itself. But the school's policy applies regardless of the reason. \n\nThen there's the outcome: suspensions and an expulsion. For a first offense, especially for minors, some might argue that the punishment is too harsh. However, if the kids were repeat offenders, the school might have a policy to deal with that. The user says one kid was expelled because they'd been caught many times, so maybe that's justified. The others might have been suspended for their first offense. \n\nThe author's action of not confronting the kids themselves but going straight to the resource officer could be seen as reporting a violation, which is a student's right. But since they didn't speak to the kids first, maybe they didn't give them a chance to stop or explain. However, it's also not the reporter's responsibility to handle the situation before involving authorities.\n\nEthically, the author might feel conflicted because the kids are young and might not understand the severity. But the school has rules for a reason, and students are expected to follow them regardless of their age. The author's own frustration with the school's decision to close the restroom might have influenced their actions, but that doesn't make the reporting wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author took it upon themselves to enforce the rules in a way that led to harsh consequences. The school's responsibility is to handle disciplinary actions appropriately, and by reporting, the author might have contributed to over-punishment. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the school is responsible for their disciplinary decisions. The author's role was to report what they saw. The question is whether the author acted in bad faith. The post suggests they didn't have malicious intent, just frustration. So, while the outcome is severe, the act of reporting isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nHowever, considering the age of the students and the potential for harsh consequences, some might say the author should have handled it differently, like talking to the kids first or bringing it up with a teacher in a more measured way. But the rules are in place for a reason, and the author's action was to report a violation. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author might feel bad about the outcome, their action of reporting the violation isn't inherently wrong. The school's response is their responsibility. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
