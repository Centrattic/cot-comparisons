So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a student who reported others vaping in a bathroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nFirst, the school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author was upset because they had to walk farther. Then, they saw more kids vaping in the other bathroom and told the resource officer. The consequences were severe for the kids, especially one who was expelled.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nFactors to consider: \n- Was the author justified in reporting? Vaping is against school rules. If they were breaking rules, the author might be right to report.\n- However, the author's motivation part of the problem (annoyed about the bathroom closure) might influence their decision. But intent doesn't necessarily make it wrong if they followed the rules.\n- The outcome affected minors. The expulsions might be harsh, but the author didn't decide that; the school did. The author's action was reporting, which is their responsibility.\n- The author didn't confront the kids directly, just informed the officer. That's a responsible action, not a prank.\n- Maybe the author overstepped by getting involved, but in a school setting, reporting violations is usually encouraged.\n\nPotential arguments against the author: They might have acted out of spite because they were frustrated with the restroom closure. But the problem (vaping) is still there, and the author is a student, not a teacher. They might not be in the wrong for following the rules.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong). They reported a violation, which is the correct procedure. The severity of the punishment is the school's decision, not the author's. Their action was responsible, even if it led to harsh consequences.\n"
