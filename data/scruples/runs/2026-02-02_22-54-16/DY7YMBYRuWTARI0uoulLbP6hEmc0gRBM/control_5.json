So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vaping incident is in the wrong. So the situation is that the school closed a restroom because students were vaping there, which made the author have to walk farther. Then, the author saw more students vaping in another restroom and told the resource officer, leading to suspensions and one expulsion. The author feels bad because they were freshmen, 14-15 years old.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules here. The school has a policy against vaping, right? So if students are violating that policy, the school is supposed to enforce it. The author reported the violation, which led to enforcement. But the author is feeling guilty because they're young and maybe didn't realize the consequences.\n\nBut wait, the author's reasoning was that the school wasn't fixing the problem by closing the restroom instead of addressing the root issue. However, the author took it upon themselves to report the incident. Is there a duty to report violations? In a school setting, students are expected to follow rules and report violations. So maybe the author did the right thing by reporting, even if they felt it was hypocritical.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have tried to talk to the students first or inform a teacher before snitching. But the situation was about a school rule violation, and the resource officer is there to handle such cases. The author saw a violation and reported it, which is part of maintaining school policies.\n\nThe fact that the students were freshmen and maybe repeat offenders matters. The expelled student was caught multiple times, so the school's action was a response to chronic violations. The author might feel bad, but if the school's policy is clear that vaping is against the rules, then enforcing it is necessary regardless of the students' age.\n\nAnother angle: The author's motivation was partly personal (having to walk farther) but also about enforcing the rule. However, the author didn't act out of malice but to address the problem. So maybe they're not at fault.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the school's responsibility is to enforce rules. If the author reported a violation, they aren't in the wrong. However, if they acted with malicious intent, that's different. Here, the author seems to have done it to address the issue, even if they felt the school's initial response was inadequate.\n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They reported a violation, which is expected. The consequences are up to the school's policies. The author's bad feeling is understandable but doesn't make them at fault.\n"
