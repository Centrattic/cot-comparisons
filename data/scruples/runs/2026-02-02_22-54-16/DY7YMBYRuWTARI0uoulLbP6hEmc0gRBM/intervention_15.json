So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

So, the situation is about a high school student who was upset because the school closed a restroom where students were vaping. He had to walk across the school to use another bathroom. Then he saw a group of freshmen vaping in that bathroom, didn't confront them directly, but instead told the school resource officer, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and the school's policies. Vaping is usually against school rules, so the students were breaking them. The author didn't do anything illegal, just reported what he saw. But he didn't directly stop the students, he went to the authorities. Is that right or wrong?\n\nThe author's intention was to address the problem the school didn't fix by closing the restroom. He might feel that the school was being lenient, so he took it upon himself to report the violation. But he ended up causing consequences for the students, including an expulsion. The author is conflicted because the students are young and maybe didn't realize the seriousness.\n\nOn one hand, he's following the rules by reporting. On the other, maybe he's being harsh on the kids who are just trying to fit in. But the school's job is to enforce rules, and the resource officer would handle it. The author didn't have to confront them, just pass the info. So maybe he's not wrong. But some might argue he should have spoken to the kids first. However, in many cases, reporting to authorities is the correct action. So probably answer B.\n"
