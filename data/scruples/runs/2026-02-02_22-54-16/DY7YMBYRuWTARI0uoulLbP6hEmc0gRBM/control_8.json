So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting a bunch of kids suspended and one expelled after reporting them for vaping in the bathroom. The situation is pretty straightforward, but I need to consider different angles.\n\nFirst, the school closed down a restroom because students were vaping there. The author was frustrated because they now had to walk across the school to use the other restroom. When they saw a group of freshmen vaping in the open restroom, they reported it to the resource officer. The result was multiple suspensions and an expulsion. The author feels bad because the kids are young and haven't learned the consequences yet.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author did the right thing by reporting the incident. On one hand, the school is enforcing rules against vaping, which is a violation of school policies. The author followed the rules by reporting the issue, which is a responsible action. On the other hand, the author might be feeling conflicted because the kids are still young and maybe the punishment is too harsh. But the school's job is to maintain discipline, so they might have acted within their policies.\n\nThe author's intention was to uphold school rules, even though they were annoyed about the inconvenience. They didn't confront the students directly but informed the authorities. That seems like a proper way to handle it. However, some might argue that the author took an extreme action that led to severe consequences. But since the students were actually violating the rules, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for reporting them. The school's response is on their end, and the author didn't decide the punishments themselves.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping itself but with the students doing it to please peers. But the act of vaping in school is against the rules regardless of the reason. So, the author's action was to report a policy violation, which is their responsibility. They might feel conflicted about the outcome, but ethically, if the action was reported appropriately, the author isn't at fault. The school's decision to expel could be due to prior offenses, which the author may not know about.\n\nIn conclusion, the author acted within their duty to report a violation. The consequences were decided by the school, so the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
