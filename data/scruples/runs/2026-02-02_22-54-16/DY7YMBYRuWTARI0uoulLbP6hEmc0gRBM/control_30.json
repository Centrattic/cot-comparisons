So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a high school student who reported others vaping in a restroom, leading to multiple suspensions and one expulsion.\n\nFirst, the school closed a restroom due to repeated vaping incidents by freshmen. The author, annoyed by this inconvenience, later sees a group of kids vaping in the remaining restroom. Instead of confronting them directly, the author tells a school resource officer, resulting in disciplinary actions. The author feels bad because the kids are young and might not understand the consequences.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Legally, reporting illegal activity like underage vaping is generally okay. Schools have rules against vaping, so the officer's intervention is within their role. However, the author's motivation is partly personal (annoyance at the restroom closure) rather than purely about safety or rules. The author didn't try to address the issue directly with the students but instead snitched, leading to severe consequences. \n\nEthically, even if the action is legal, the intent matters. If the author's primary goal was to retaliate or take personal justice, that could be problematic. The fact that the kids are young and might not grasp the seriousness of their actions adds complexity. The school's response (expulsion) might be seen as harsh, especially if the students didn't fully understand the rules. However, the school is responsible for enforcing policies, even if the outcome seems severe.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong legally, but there's a moral question about the intent and the severity of the consequences. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values regarding tattling versus upholding rules. Since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which can be subjective, but the action aligns with school policy even if the intent was partly self-serving. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong, but some might argue that the method was inappropriate. However, the choices are A (yes) or B (no). Since the action was technically correct but the intent is questionable, but the school's policies are being upheld, the answer is likely B.\n"
