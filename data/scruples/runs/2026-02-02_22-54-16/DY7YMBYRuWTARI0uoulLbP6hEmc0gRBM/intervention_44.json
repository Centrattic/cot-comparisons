So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a high school student who reported a bunch of kids vaping in a bathroom, leading to suspensions and one expulsion. The user is asking if they (AITA) are at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the school's rules. If the school has a policy against vaping, then students are supposed to follow that. The freshmen were vaping in the bathroom, which is a violation. The author didn't do anything illegal by reporting what they saw. They actually took action against the rule-breaking.\n\nBut why does the author feel bad? They mention that the kids are 14-15, maybe not fully understanding the consequences. The school closed a restroom because of previous incidents, but the problem persisted. The author was inconvenienced by having to walk to the other side of the school, which might be a motivating factor. They didn't confront the kids but went straight to the resource officer. \n\nIs the author responsible for the consequences? They followed the procedure by informing the authorities. The school's decision to expel one student is their own policy. The author's report led to actions, but they didn't decide the punishments. So, maybe they're not in the wrong for doing the right thing by the school's rules. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author was harsh or didn't give the kids a chance. But the school's role is to enforce rules, and the author was acting as a student who observed the violation. The main issue is whether the author acted within the rules. Since they reported the incident to the proper authority, they probably aren't in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
