So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author's school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. They got annoyed because now they have to walk to the other side of the school. Later, they see more students vaping in the other bathroom and report them to a school resource officer. As a result, several kids are suspended and one is expelled. The author is feeling bad because the kids are freshmen, around 14-15 years old, and maybe haven't realized how the world works yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the school's policies. If the school is against vaping and the students are breaking rules, then reporting them is following the rules. However, the school's approach of closing a bathroom without addressing the root problem might have caused students to move the problem elsewhere. The author's action was to report the ongoing violation, which seems like a responsible choice. But then, the consequences were harsh, especially for freshmen. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the students were indeed violating the rules, so reporting them is technically correct. However, the author might have felt the punishment was too severe. The key points here are whether the author had a duty to report, and if their intent was malicious. The author's motivation was frustration with the school's handling of the issue, not just to get kids in trouble. They didn't act out of spite but to address a problem they found unfair. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that as a student, the author should have tried to find a solution without involving authorities, like talking to teachers first. But given that the school had already shut down a bathroom without fixing the issue, maybe the author felt that the only way to make a change was to report the ongoing violations. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping itself but the fact that students are doing it to impress peers. That shows they're not targeting the students for vaping but for breaking school rules. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is following the rules and trying to address a problem they see as being ignored. The harsh consequences of the report might be on the school's hands for their disciplinary actions, not the author. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting the students.\n"
