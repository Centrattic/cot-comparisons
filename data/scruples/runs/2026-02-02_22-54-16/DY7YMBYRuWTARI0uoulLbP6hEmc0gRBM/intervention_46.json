So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a high school closing a restroom because students were vaping there. The author was annoyed because they had to walk farther for the bathroom. Then, when they saw more students vaping in another restroom, they went to the school resource officer and reported it, leading to suspensions and one expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. Schools have rules against vaping, right? So if students are breaking those rules, the school has a duty to enforce them. The author reported the wrongdoing, which is generally seen as a positive thing. However, the kids involved are freshmen, around 14-15, which is pretty young. The author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping itself but with the kids doing it to impress peers.\n\nThe author's motivation was frustration with the school's handling of the problem. They felt the school wasn't addressing it by just closing a restroom instead of punishing the students. By reporting the incident, they might have been trying to hold the school accountable or stop the behavior. But is there a line they crossed?\n\nOn one hand, the author is following the rules and helping the school enforce them. On the other hand, they might have acted out of personal annoyance rather than a genuine concern for the students' well-being. Also, the consequences were severe (expulsion), which could be harsh for minors, especially if they're making mistakes that are common at that age.\n\nBut is the author responsible for the school's decision to expel? The school has the authority to take disciplinary actions as per their policies. The author just reported what they saw. Unless they lied or exaggerated, which isn't indicated here, they're not directly responsible for the punishment's severity. However, their action led to multiple suspensions and an expulsion. The question is whether their intervention was justified.\n\nThe author might feel conflicted because they're a student too, and seeing peers get in trouble can be tough. But in terms of right and wrong, if the students were indeed in violation of school rules, the author is within their rights to report. The school's response is their responsibility. The author isn't in the wrong for doing the right thing by reporting illegal or rule-breaking activities. But maybe there's a nuance if they should have considered the consequences for the students' futures. Yet, the school's job is to maintain order and enforce rules, so the author isn't necessarily at fault here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). They reported a problem, which is a responsible action, even if it led to harsh consequences. The school's policies and how they enforce them are separate from the author's decision to report.\n"
