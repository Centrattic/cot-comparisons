So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for getting several kids suspended and one expelled. The situation is that the school closed a restroom where students were vaping. The author, frustrated because they have to walk far for the bathroom, then catches some kids vaping in another restroom and reports them.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to address the problem they saw. They didn't like the school's solution of closing a restroom without addressing the root issue. When they saw kids vaping again, they decided to report them. The main question is whether they acted wrongfully.\n\nThe author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping itself but disapprove of the kids doing it at school for peer approval. So their motivation isn't just to hurt the kids but to stop the behavior they see as wrong. However, the kids are freshmen, around 14-15, which is a young age. The question is whether the author should have handled it differently, like talking to a teacher first instead of directly reporting the officers.\n\nOn one hand, the author is taking a stand against breaking school rules, which is their right. Schools often encourage students to report violations. On the other hand, the consequences were severe (expulsion), and the kids are young. The author might not have considered if the resource officer would handle it appropriately or if there were extenuating circumstances. However, the author didn't do anything illegal; they reported what they saw. The school's policy might require such reports. The author also felt bad about it, which shows some remorse, but the action itself was within bounds. So, probably the answer is B (not in the wrong), but there's a gray area. The kids' ages might mitigate the severity, but the author isn't necessarily at fault for reporting the incident.\n"
