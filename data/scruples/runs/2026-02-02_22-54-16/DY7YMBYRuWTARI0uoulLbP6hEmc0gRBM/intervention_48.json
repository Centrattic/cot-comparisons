So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a high school student who reported other students vaping in a bathroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The author is conflicted because the students were young.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the school. If the school has a policy against vaping, then the students were indeed breaking the rules. The author reported them, which could be seen as doing the right thing by following the school's policies. However, there's the aspect of the students' age. They're 14-15 years old, so maybe they didn't realize the consequences. But the school's responsibility is to enforce rules consistently, regardless of the students' maturity level.\n\nThe author's motivation was frustration with the school's prior inaction. By shutting down the bathroom instead of addressing the root problem, the school might have created an environment where students felt they had to find new places to vape. The author took it upon themselves to report the activity, which resulted in disciplinary actions. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? If the school's rules are clear, then the author isn't necessarily at fault for reporting. But if the school's approach is considered harsh and the author's action led to disproportionate consequences, maybe there's some fault. However, the author didn't know beforehand that one student would be expelled; they just reported what they saw. The school's decision to expel someone might be their own policy, so the author isn't responsible for that. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have overstepped by actively \"busting\" the students, which could be seen as taking matters into their own hands. But in a school setting, students are often encouraged to report violations. The author's action could be justified as cooperating with school authorities to maintain order. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they were following the school's rules and reporting illegal or policy-violating behavior. The school's enforcement of consequences is their own responsibility, not the student's.\n"
