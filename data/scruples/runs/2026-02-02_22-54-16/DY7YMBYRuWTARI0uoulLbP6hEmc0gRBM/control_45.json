So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for getting kids suspended and one expelled. The situation is about a high school where they closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author is upset because they have to walk farther to the bathroom now. Later, they see other students vaping in the other bathroom, tell a resource officer, and this leads to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and the school's policies. The school closed the restroom because students were violating rules by vaping. The author didn't like the inconvenience but decided to report others, even though they didn't mind the act itself but the peer pressure aspect. \n\nThe author didn't confront the students but went straight to the resource officer. The key point is whether the author overstepped. Some might argue that the author was being a tattletale, especially since they mentioned they don't have a problem with vaping but the peer pressure aspect. However, they were following school rules by reporting the violation. \n\nOn the other hand, the school's decision to close the bathroom might have been a poor administrative choice, leading students to find other places to vape. The author's action might have been a way to hold the school accountable for their own policies. But the author's motivation was personal inconvenience, which could be seen as selfish.\n\nThe other side is that the author is taking responsibility for enforcing rules, even if they are unhappy with the school's approach. The expelled student had a history, so the punishment might have been deserved. The author might be in the right because they reported a violation, even if it had unintended consequences. \n\nBut considering the age of the students and the potential harshness of the punishment (expulsion), some might argue the author didn't consider the consequences. However, the school's responsibility is to enforce rules, and the author was following through with that. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author reported a rule violation, but there's a nuance. Alternatively, A could be if the author's action was vindictive. Need to weigh the intentions and consequences.\n"
