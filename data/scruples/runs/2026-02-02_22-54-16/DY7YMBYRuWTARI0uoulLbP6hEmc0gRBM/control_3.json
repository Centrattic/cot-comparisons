So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a high school that closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author got annoyed because now they have to walk further to the bathroom. Then, they saw a group of kids vaping in the other bathroom. Instead of reporting it or telling someone, they told the resource officer right then and there, leading to multiple suspensions and one expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the school. If vaping is against school policy, then the students are violating the rules. The author reported them, so maybe that's their duty. But then again, the author was upset because the school just closed a bathroom instead of addressing the root problem. The author might feel the school's approach was unfair, but they still took matters into their own hands by confronting the issue directly.\n\nNow, the author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping per se, but the students are doing it to impress peers. The action led to several suspensions, including a kid who was expelled for repeated offenses. The author feels bad because the students are freshmen, young and might not understand consequences. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they reported the violations, which is technically right. But maybe they could have handled it differently, like informing a teacher first or letting the school handle it. By confronting the situation directly, they might have been overstepping, even if their intent was to stop the vaping. The school's response is harsh, and the author might be contributing to the problem by using a heavy-handed approach on minors. \n\nAlso, the author's motivation was personal inconvenience, which might cloud their judgment. They didn't confront the students but immediately reported them, which could be seen as snitching. The expelled student had prior issues, so the school's decision might be justified, but the author's role in escalating the situation could be questioned. \n\nIn some perspectives, the author did the right thing by enforcing school rules. However, the method and the resulting consequences for the students might make the author partially responsible for the harsh outcomes. The fact that they're feeling bad about it suggests internal conflict. So, is it A or B? The answer isn't clear, but considering the age of the students and the author's role in their suspension/expulsion, maybe the author is in the wrong (A). But if the school's policy is strict, then the author isn't wrong (B). Hmm.\n"
