So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author was inconvenienced since they had to go to the other side of the school. Later, they saw more students vaping in another restroom and reported it, leading to several suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the school's rules. If vaping is against school policy, then students are violating those rules. The author reported the incident, which is a civic duty, but the consequences were severe. The user is conflicted because they feel bad about the outcome, especially since the kids are young.\n\nThe author's intent was to stop rule-breaking, but their motivation was personal inconvenience. This could be a point of contention. The question is whether their action was justified. On one hand, they're reporting illegal activity. On the other, the harsh punishment might make them feel responsible.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they don't have an issue with vaping itself but the peer pressure aspect. However, the act of reporting led to consequences. The school's response (expulsion) might be seen as too harsh for the students' age, but the author isn't the one deciding the punishment. They just reported what they saw.\n\nIs the author at fault for not intervening earlier when the first bathroom was closed? They didn't report the initial vaping incidents that led to the closure, only the later one. This could imply they had a personal motive (inconvenience) rather than acting consistently against the rule. But maybe they didn't know about those incidents or weren't present.\n\nThe key points are: Did the author act within their rights? They reported a violation, which is acceptable. Are they responsible for the school's disciplinary actions? Not really; that's the school's responsibility. However, the author might feel guilty for contributing to the kids' expulsions, especially if they were repeat offenders. The expelled kid had been caught many times, so maybe the consequence was due to prior actions, not just this incident.\n\nIn terms of wrongdoing, the author didn't break any rules. Reporting the incident is the right thing to do. However, the personal motivation (due to inconvenience) might affect their moral standing, but legally, they're not in the wrong. The school's handling of the situation is a separate issue. So the answer would likely be B (No), but there's nuance in their intent and the consequences.\n"
