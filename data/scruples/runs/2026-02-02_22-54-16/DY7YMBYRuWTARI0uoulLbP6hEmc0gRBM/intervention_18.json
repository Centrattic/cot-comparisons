So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down the situation here. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The summary is that the school closed a restroom due to students vaping there, which inconvenienced the author. Later, the author saw more students vaping in another bathroom and reported them, leading to suspensions and one expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and consequences. The school had a policy against vaping, so the students were violating a school rule. The author reported the violation, which is a responsible action in most cases. However, the author is now feeling guilty because the students were young (freshmen) and maybe didn't realize the consequences.\n\nBut is the author actually in the wrong? Well, by reporting the illegal activity, they're following the rules and maybe trying to help the school address the problem. The school closure was a reactive measure, and the author's action was to enforce the existing policy. The fact that the author was inconvenienced by the closure might have motivated them, but the action itself was within their right to report the violation.\n\nHowever, the question is about moral wrongdoing. The author might feel bad because the students were young, but the school's responsibility is to enforce policies consistently. The author's action led to suspensions, which is a school decision. The key point is whether the author overstepped by not just reporting but \"busting\" the kids, which could imply a more aggressive approach. But even so, informing a resource officer about a rule violation is standard. The author didn't set up a trap or anything illegal; they just informed authorities.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping itself, just that the students were doing it to impress peers. So their intent was to stop the misconduct, not target the students personally. The result was the school taking action, which is within their authority.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, it's possible to argue that the author did the right thing by upholding the rules, even if it led to harsh consequences. The school's responsibility is to maintain a safe environment, and vaping is a health and safety issue. The author's action aligns with that, even if they now feel guilty for the outcome. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
