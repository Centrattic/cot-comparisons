So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported the vaping incident is in the wrong. The situation is that a high school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author, frustrated because they now have to walk farther for the bathroom, later sees more students vaping in the other restroom and reports them, leading to suspensions and one expulsion.\n\nFirst, the school closed a restroom due to repeated violations. The author is annoyed because their routine is disrupted but doesn't condone the students' actions. They report the incident, which leads to consequences. The author feels bad because the kids are young and maybe not fully aware of the situation.\n\nThe key points here are intent and the school's policies. The author's action was to address what they see as the school's failure to handle the problem. They might have felt they had to take matters into their own hands. However, by reporting, they followed the system the school has in place (alerting the resource officer). The school's policies likely deal with vaping incidents, so the author is following the rules.\n\nBut there's an argument that the author's frustration led to an overreaction, especially since it resulted in expulsion. However, the resource officer probably acted according to school policy. The author might not be in the wrong because they reported illegal activity, even if it had consequences. The school's response is their own responsibility. The author's intention was to stop the behavior, not to target the students.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say the author should have addressed their frustration with the school's decision first, rather than acting impulsively. But the act of reporting illegal activity isn't wrong. The students were violating school rules, and the author isn't the one at fault for enforcing those rules through the proper channels.\n"
