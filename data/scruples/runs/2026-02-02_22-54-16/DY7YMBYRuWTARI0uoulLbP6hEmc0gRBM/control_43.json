So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a high school student who got multiple kids suspended and one expelled for vaping in the bathroom. The school closed a restroom because of this, and the author, frustrated by having to walk farther, later reported a group of students vaping in another bathroom. The school took action, and the author feels bad because they were all freshmen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the school. If the school has a policy against vaping, then the students were violating the rules. The author reported them, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. But the author is feeling bad because the kids are young and maybe didn't realize the consequences. \n\nThe author's motivation was frustration with the school's handling of the problem. They shut down a restroom instead of addressing the root issue, so the author took action. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the author is following the rules by reporting the violation. Schools often encourage students to report such incidents. But on the other hand, the author might have overstepped by not warning the students first or considering their age. The author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping itself but with the peer pressure aspect. \n\nIs it the author's responsibility to handle this? Maybe not directly. However, the school's policies require students to report violations. The author's actions led to severe consequences, so there's a moral dilemma here. The author didn't confront the kids first, just reported them immediately. \n\nIn some cases, speaking up to authorities is the right step. But given the age of the students and the fact that they might be experimenting without full understanding, the author could have approached it differently. However, the school's policy might not allow for that. The author's intention was to address the problem they had with the restroom closure, which was a result of the school's inaction. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They followed the rules but might have contributed to harsh consequences for minors. The answer could depend on the school's policies. If the school's policy is strict and the author was just following it, then B (not in the wrong). If the author acted out of personal frustration without considering the kids' circumstances, then A (in the wrong). \n\nBut given the context, the author's actions were in line with school policy. The school itself had a pattern of closing restrooms instead of disciplining students harshly. The author's report led to action that the school hadn't taken before. The author's intent was to solve the problem, even if it had unintended consequences. So, it's a bit of a gray area. However, since the author is now feeling remorseful and the kids were young, maybe the answer is that the author is not in the wrong because they followed the rules, but there's a moral consideration. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about moral judgment. So, strictly by the rules, the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, answer B.\n"
