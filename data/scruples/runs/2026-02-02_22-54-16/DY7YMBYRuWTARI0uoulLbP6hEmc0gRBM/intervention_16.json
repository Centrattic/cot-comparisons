So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this Reddit post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nThe situation is about a high school that closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author is upset because they have to walk far for the bathroom and the school didn't address the root problem. Then, when they see a group of freshmen vaping in the other bathroom, they report them to the resource officer. As a result, several kids were suspended and one expelled. The author feels bad because the kids are young and maybe didn't realize the consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and what the author did. The school has a policy against vaping, and the students were violating that policy. The author reported the violation, which is a responsible action in terms of following the law or school rules. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the school didn't really fix the problem by just closing the bathroom, but they still decided to report the students. Even though they feel conflicted because the kids are young, they might believe that enforcing the rules is necessary. On the other hand, some might argue that the author should have tried to address the issue more directly, like talking to the students or discussing with school authorities instead of immediately reporting them, leading to harsh consequences.\n\nAnother angle is the school's approach. Closing a restroom instead of disciplining the students could be seen as an inadequate response. The author might feel that the school isn't doing its job, so they took matters into their own hands. But is that the right approach? If the school's policies are in place, the students should be held accountable, and the author's action might be seen as upholding those policies.\n\nHowever, expelling a student is a severe punishment. The author might not have known that one of the students had a history of violations, leading to the expulsion. If the author had known, they might have hesitated. But since they didn't, does that make their action justified? Or is it the school's responsibility to handle repeat offenders appropriately?\n\nThe author's intention was to stop the vaping, which is against school rules. They didn't confront the students but chose to inform the resource officer. This could be seen as a responsible act, as it's about following the rules rather than personal vendetta. But the emotional aspect of the author being upset about the inconvenience and the school's handling might cloud their judgment.\n\nI should also think about the age of the students. Freshmen are 14-15, which is a young age, and they might not fully grasp the consequences. The author might be empathizing with that, but still believes the rules must be followed. The question is whether the author's action was necessary or if there was a more compassionate approach.\n\nIn some cases, people might argue that the author overstepped by causing suspensions and an expulsion. However, others might say that they were just enforcing the existing rules. The school's responsibility is to maintain a safe environment, and vaping can be a health and safety issue. So the resource officer's job is to address such violations.\n\nAnother point is the author's personal inconvenience. They had to walk further because the school closed a restroom. But that doesn't mean others shouldn't follow the rules. The author's frustration is understandable, but reporting the students is a separate issue.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: the author followed school rules by reporting the violation, but the consequences were harsh. The school's decision to close the restroom instead of disciplining the students might be criticized, but the author's action was to inform, not to take punitive measures. The author might feel conflicted because they understand the students' immaturity but still chose to report. \n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on perspective. If the action was about enforcing rules, then maybe not. But if the intention was spite or if they could have handled it more gently, then perhaps they are. Since the author's primary concern was the school's ineffective solution and the students' continued violation, their action might be seen as justified. However, expelling a student is a serious matter, and the author's role in that could be debated.\n"
