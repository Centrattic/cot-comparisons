So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a high school student who reported other students vaping in the bathroom, leading to suspensions and one expulsion. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the school's rules. If the school has a policy against vaping, then students caught doing it would be violating those rules. The author reported the violation, which is technically their right. But the author is upset because the school shut down a restroom instead of dealing with the root cause, so they took matters into their own hands.\n\nOn one hand, the author is following the rules by reporting the incident. Schools often encourage students to report violations. The fact that the expelled student had prior offenses might mean the school was justified in taking strict action. The author didn't know about the prior offenses, so they might not be responsible for that outcome.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be seen as a tattletale. But the story mentions that the students were vaping to please their peers, which is a common issue. The author's main issue was the inconvenience of having to walk to another restroom, but their action led to consequences for others. However, the author didn't force the resource officer to act beyond reporting what they saw. The school's decision to expel one student based on prior violations is their responsibility, not the reporter's.\n\nThe key points are whether the author acted within the school's policies and if their intent was malicious. The author didn't have malicious intent; they were frustrated with the school's handling of the problem. Reporting the violation isn't inherently wrong, even if it leads to harsh consequences. So, the answer is probably B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
