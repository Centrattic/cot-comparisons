So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a high school restroom being closed due to vaping, and the author then seeing a group of freshmen vaping in another bathroom and reporting them, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the key points. The school closed a bathroom to stop vaping, but that didn't solve the problem. The author is annoyed because they have to walk a long way to the bathroom. When they see the kids vaping again, they report it to the resource officer. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for causing suspensions and an expulsion, especially since the kids are 14-15 and maybe not fully aware of consequences.\n\nSo, the author's actions: they saw the kids vaping, reported it, leading to severe punishments. The author feels bad because the kids are young and might not understand the real-world implications. The possible issues here are the author's intent, the proportionality of the punishment, and whether the school's approach is fair.\n\nThe author didn't vape themselves, just reported others. The school's policy is against vaping, so the author is following the rules. However, the punishment might be too harsh if it's a first offense or if the school has a pattern of leniency. But the school did expel a kid who had been caught multiple times, which suggests that repeated offenses have severe consequences. The author's action led to that, so maybe they didn't know the kid's history. \n\nBut the author's main reason was personal inconvenience (having to walk far to the bathroom) rather than a moral stance against vaping. However, the school's rules are still in place, so reporting the violation is technically correct. The problem is the outcome\u2014expelling a kid. If the school's policy is strict, then the author is just following the policy. But if the punishment is disproportionate, maybe the author is overstepping.\n\nThe user's perspective is that they feel bad about the consequences, especially on young students. The dilemma here is between doing the right thing by reporting and the harshness of the punishment. The school's responsibility is to enforce rules, but the author might not be in the wrong for reporting as they are supposed to. However, if the author knew the kids were repeatedly getting into trouble and still reported them, maybe they are. But the story says the author didn't know about the kid's history until after the fact. \n\nSo, the author's action was based on seeing the violation, not prior knowledge. The school's policy is to enforce against vaping, so the author isn't in the wrong for reporting. The punishment is up to the school, and the author might not be responsible for that. However, the author's motivation was personal annoyance, which could be seen as insincere, but the action itself (reporting) is still technically correct. \n\nBut maybe the author should have considered that the kids are young and might not realize the seriousness. However, the school has rules for a reason, and students should be aware. The author isn't responsible for the school's punishment decisions. So, the answer might be B (No), but I need to check if there's any ethical issue in reporting for personal reasons. Alternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong for not intervening earlier or for allowing the situation to escalate. But the school had already closed the other bathroom, so the problem wasn't solved. The author's action led to consequences, but the school's responsibility is to enforce rules. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting, even if their motivation was personal. The answer would be B.\n"
