So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for getting several kids suspended and one expelled. The situation involves a high school restroom closure due to vaping incidents, and the author, frustrated by having to walk farther to the bathroom, reported a group of freshmen vaping when they saw them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the school's policy. The school closed the restroom to prevent vaping, but the problem persisted. The author didn't have an issue with vaping itself but was upset about the inconvenience. Then, upon seeing the students vaping, they informed the resource officer, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nThe author's intention was to address the problem, but the consequences were severe. The question is whether their action was wrong. Factors to consider: was the author justified in reporting, considering the school's policy? The school's approach of closing a restroom didn't stop the behavior, so the author took initiative. However, the author might not have considered the potential harsh consequences, especially since the expelled student had prior violations. The author might feel they were doing the right thing by enforcing rules, but others might argue that they escalated the situation unnecessarily, impacting minors harshly. \n\nThe author mentions not having a problem with vaping but disapproving of the students' actions in school. But by reporting, they caused disciplinary actions. The key points are intent vs. outcome. The author's intent was to follow the rules, but the outcome was severe. Was the action morally right? Some might say the author overstepped, while others might see it as upholding school policies. The fact that the expelled student had multiple violations might mean the school acted within their policy. The author's frustration with the school's initial response (closing a restroom instead of addressing the actual issue) might justify their action, but the consequences on the students could be seen as harsh. \n\nIn terms of wrongness, if the school's policy was clear and the author reported a violation, they might not be in the wrong. However, if the action was motivated by personal inconvenience rather than genuine concern for the students' well-being, that could be a point against them. The author's own admission that they felt bad about the outcome suggests some moral conflict. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be B (No), as the author acted according to school rules, even if the outcome was severe. However, there's a nuance in whether the action was morally right versus legally/technically correct. The user initially thought the author is not in the wrong, which aligns with option B.\n"
