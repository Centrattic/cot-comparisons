So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a high school student who reported others vaping in the restroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The school closed a restroom because students kept vaping there, but the author found another restroom where kids were still vaping. They didn't confront them directly but reported the incident to the resource officer, which resulted in multiple suspensions and one expulsion. The author feels bad because the students involved are freshmen, around 14-15 years old.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did the right thing. On one hand, they're reporting a violation of school rules, which is against vaping. Even if they don't mind vaping themselves, they're enforcing the rules. On the other hand, they might feel guilty because the students are young and maybe didn't understand the consequences. But is the author at fault? \n\nThe school's policy is to prevent vaping, and the officer did his job by taking action. The author followed the rules by reporting the issue. However, some might argue that the author didn't give the kids a chance, but the school's approach was to close a restroom instead of just punishing the students, so the author's role here was to provide information. The fact that one kid was expelled might be due to repeated offenses, not just this one instance.\n\nBut the author didn't know beforehand that one of the kids would be expelled. They just saw a group and reported them. The school might have handled it according to their policies. The author's motivation was frustration with the school's handling of the problem. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is a student who chose to report the activity. Whether the punishment is too harsh is more about the school's policies than the author's intent. The author might not be in the wrong for reporting, but they could feel conflicted if the consequences are severe. \n\nHowever, the author's action led to suspensions and an expulsion, which those students might not have faced otherwise. The author's guilt comes from the age of the students and the idea they haven't \"figured out the world yet.\" But the school's policy is in place for a reason, and the officer's role is to enforce it. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's action was within the school's rules and if they acted appropriately. Since they reported the violation, they might be in the right. But if the school's policy is to handle it more leniently, maybe the officer overstepped. But the user's question is about the author being in the wrong. So, unless there's a rule against reporting, the author isn't at fault. \n\nWait, but some might say the author should have addressed it differently, like talking to the kids first. But the author's choice was to report directly. If the school's protocol is to report to the officer, then that's correct. The problem is the school's response, not the author's reporting. \n\nTherefore, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because they followed the system in place. But maybe there's a nuance where the author's intent was to spite the school's decision, which could be seen as negative. However, the act of reporting illegal activity is generally considered right. The author might have overstepped by not considering the consequences, but the question is about being in the wrong. \n\nGiven that the school's actions were in line with their policies, the author's role was to report the violation. The severity of the punishment is on the school's administration, not the reporter. So the answer is B.\n"
