So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a high school closed a restroom because kids were vaping there. The author felt this was unfair because they now had to walk a long way to the bathroom. Then, the author saw more kids vaping in the other bathroom, told the school resource officer, and as a result, several students were suspended and one expelled. The author is now feeling bad because they were all freshmen, around 14-15 years old.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the school. If the school has a policy against vaping, then students are violating it. The author reported what they saw, which is usually considered a responsible action. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the author is following the rules and doing the right thing by reporting illegal or prohibited activities. Schools often encourage students to report such incidents to maintain a safe environment. If the author didn't report it, the problem might continue, and other students could be affected. Also, the author might be trying to fix the issue they were upset about\u2014by stopping the vaping, maybe the school would reconsider closing the bathroom or find another solution.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is being harsh on the freshmen, who are still young and might not fully understand the consequences. The expulsions could have long-term effects on those students' lives. However, the school's actions are within their authority to enforce rules. The author didn't set the policies; they just reported what they saw. \n\nAnother angle is the author's motivation. They were upset about the bathroom closure, which led them to report the incident. But their intention wasn't to target the students for revenge; they were trying to address a problem they had. The key is whether the action was justified. Since vaping is against school rules, reporting it is justified regardless of personal feelings about the situation.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author didn't vape themselves but reported others suggests their main concern was the school's rules and their own inconvenience. However, the consequences for the students are severe, but the school is the one deciding the punishments, not the author. The author's role was just to inform them.\n\nIn conclusion, even though the author might feel guilty about the outcome, their action was in line with the school's rules. Unless there was evidence that the students hadn't done anything wrong, the author isn't in the wrong here. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
