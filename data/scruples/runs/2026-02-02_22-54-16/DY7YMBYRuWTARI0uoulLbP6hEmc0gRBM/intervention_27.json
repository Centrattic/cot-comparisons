So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for getting multiple students suspended and one expelled after reporting them for vaping. The situation is that the school closed a restroom because students were vaping there, but the author needed to go to the other side of the school now. Then they saw more students vaping in the other restroom and reported them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and the author's role. The school has a policy against vaping, and the resource officer is there to enforce those policies. The author didn't do anything illegal, just informed the officer of what they saw. They mention they don't have a problem with vaping per se, but the kids are using it to fit in. \n\nBut wait, the author's motivation was partly about the inconvenience of the restroom closure. They were upset because they had to walk farther. Then they took action when they saw a group of students vaping in the other restroom. The question is whether they're in the wrong for doing that. \n\nOn one hand, the author is following the rules and helping the school enforce them. Vaping in school is a violation, and reporting it is the right thing. The expelled student had a history, so maybe the punishment fits. The author didn't confront the students directly, just reported to the officer. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have acted out of personal annoyance rather than a genuine concern for the students' well-being. Also, the fact that they didn't say anything to the kids at first and just left, then later reported them might be seen as not giving them a chance to stop. But the kids were still in the act when the officer arrived, so the punishment is the school's decision. \n\nThe author feels bad because the students are young and haven't realized the consequences yet. But the school is responsible for enforcing rules consistently. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing by reporting, even if they had some personal frustration. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They reported a violation, which is their responsibility. The school's closure of the restroom was a reactive measure, and the author's report led to addressing the ongoing issue. The expelled student had prior offenses, so the outcome isn't entirely due to the author. The main issue is the author's intent, which was to stop the behavior, even if they were annoyed. So the answer is B, No.\n"
