So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a high school closing a restroom because kids were vaping there, and then someone else later reports a bunch of kids vaping in another bathroom, leading to suspensions and one expulsion.\n\nFirst, the school closed the restroom instead of punishing the students. The author is upset about this because they have to walk farther to the bathroom. Then, when they see other kids vaping in a different bathroom, they report them. The author says they don't have a problem with vaping itself but with the kids doing it at school to impress peers. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's intention was to address the problem they thought the school wasn't handling. By reporting the kids, they might have prevented vaping in the school, which is against school rules. However, the consequences were suspensions and an expulsion, which the author now feels bad about because the kids are young and maybe didn't realize the consequences.\n\nOn one hand, the author is following the rules by reporting the violation. Schools have policies against vaping, and students are supposed to enforce them. The resource officer is there to handle such situations, so the author might be doing the right thing by informing them. But on the other hand, the author might be overstepping if they didn't report it directly to the appropriate authority first, like a teacher or the resource officer, instead of just informing the officer on the spot. Also, the author mentions not having a problem with vaping itself, which might mean their motivation was more about the peers' behavior than the act itself. \n\nBut the school's policy is to prevent vaping, regardless of the student's intent. The author is helping enforce that policy. However, the outcome was harsh punishments for the kids. The author might feel responsible for the consequences, but they might not be in the wrong since they reported a violation. Alternatively, they might be in the wrong if they were vindictive, but the story doesn't clearly show that. It seems more like they wanted to fix a problem they were frustrated by.\n\nSo considering all that, the answer might be B (No), because the author is enforcing school rules, even if the consequences were severe. But if the author had a malicious intent, it could be A. But the story indicates they were frustrated with the school's previous inaction and wanted to prevent others from vaping, which is a legitimate concern. So likely B.\n"
