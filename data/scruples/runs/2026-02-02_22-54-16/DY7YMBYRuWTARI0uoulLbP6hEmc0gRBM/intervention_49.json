So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves them reporting a group of students vaping in a bathroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The school closed a restroom because students were vaping there, but the problem moved to another bathroom. The author, frustrated with the inconvenience, reports the students. The main question is whether this action crosses a line.\n\nThe author doesn't have an issue with vaping itself but with the students breaking school rules. They didn't confront the kids directly but informed a resource officer. The consequences were severe for some students, leading the author to feel guilty because the kids are young.\n\nNow, thinking about accountability. Schools have rules for a reason, and students are supposed to follow them. Vaping in school is against policies, so by reporting, the author is upholding those rules. However, the method and intent matter. The author's motive was partly about their own inconvenience, which could be seen as self-serving. But they didn't fabricate evidence; they observed the violation and reported it.\n\nAnother angle is the school's response. The severity of the punishment (expulsion) might be questioned, but the author isn't responsible for that\u2014it's the school's decision. The author isn't in the wrong for reporting what they saw, even if the outcome is harsh. They didn't know the school's disciplinary history with that student.\n\nThe author feeling bad shows they have empathy, which is important. But legally and according to school policies, they did the right thing. So, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong). However, the author should perhaps consider if there were other ways to address the issue without such severe consequences, but based on the information given, their action was within their rights.\n"
