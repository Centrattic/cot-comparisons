So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting multiple kids suspended and one expelled after reporting them for vaping in a restroom. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the school closed down a restroom because students were vaping there. The author is upset because now they have to walk a longer distance. Then, they see a group of freshmen vaping in the other restroom and decide to report it to the resource officer. The result is suspensions and an expulsion. The author feels bad because the kids are young and might not understand the consequences.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did the right thing. On one hand, they're following the rules by reporting the violation. The school's policy is against vaping, and the officer is there to enforce laws. The author might be justified if they believe the school is being unfair by closing a restroom instead of addressing the root issue. But on the other hand, the kids are minors, and the author's action led to severe consequences. The author didn't confront the kids directly but immediately reported them. \n\nI need to consider the intent. The author's main issue was with the school's handling of the problem, not the act of vaping itself. However, by reporting, they're still upholding the school's rules. The problem here is that the school's approach was to shut down a restroom instead of punishing the students, leading to more people using the other one. The author's action might have been a way to push the school to take real action. \n\nBut maybe the author should have considered talking to the kids first or bringing it up with teachers instead of directly to the police. However, the resource officer is a school official responsible for enforcing discipline. The author might not be in the wrong for reporting a rule violation. The fact that they felt bad afterward shows guilt, but the action itself was within their rights. \n\nI think the key points are the school's prior inaction and the author's responsibility to follow through. The author might feel like the school isn't doing enough, so they take it upon themselves. But is that their responsibility? If the school has policies in place and the officer is there to enforce them, then the author isn't necessarily wrong. The outcome (expulsion) is the school's decision, not the author's. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No), but I'm not 100% sure. Maybe some people would argue that the author should have handled it differently, like anonymously reporting or talking to an administrator instead of the police. But others might say they were just doing the right thing by informing authorities. Since the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and the scenario is about following rules, I'll go with B.\n"
