So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a high school student who reported other students vaping in the bathroom, leading to suspensions and one expulsion. The person is feeling bad because the students were all freshmen, 14-15 years old.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author is upset about having to walk farther for the bathroom. Then, they see more students vaping in another bathroom, don't confront them, but instead tell a resource officer, leading to consequences for the kids. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's intent, their actions, and the consequences. The school's policy and the students' ages are also factors. The author claims they don't have an issue with vaping itself but with the students doing it to impress peers. However, they took action by reporting, which led to harsh penalties.\n\nNow, considering responsibility. The school's job is to enforce rules, and students are expected to follow them. If the school has a no-vaping policy, students are supposed to comply. The author reported the violation, which is a duty they might feel they have. However, the age of the students and their maturity level could be a factor. But legally, the school is responsible for enforcing rules regardless of the students' age. \n\nAnother angle is whether the author acted recklessly. They didn't confront the students directly but went straight to the authority. That might be seen as a responsible action or as snitching. The author's own frustration with the closed restroom might have influenced their decision, but the act of reporting a policy violation is generally considered right. \n\nHowever, the consequence was an expulsion for one student, which the author feels bad about. The school's response might be too harsh, but the author isn't directly responsible for the school's disciplinary decisions. Their role was to report the violation. Even if the punishment seems excessive, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting the actual violation.\n\nPotential counterarguments: Some might say the author didn't try to address the issue directly first, like talking to the students or the school about the restroom closure. But the school already closed the restroom, and the author might not have authority to change that. Reporting the ongoing violation is within their rights.\n\nAlso, the author's initial frustration about the closed restroom could be seen as a personal grievance, but that doesn't negate the act of reporting another violation. The main issue is the students vaping in another bathroom, which the school needs to address regardless of the author's personal feelings.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might feel conflicted about the outcome, their action of reporting the violation isn't wrong. The responsibility for the disciplinary measures lies with the school. Therefore, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
