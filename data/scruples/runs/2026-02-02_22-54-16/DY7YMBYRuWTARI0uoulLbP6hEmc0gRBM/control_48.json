So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The story is about a high school student who reported other students vaping in a bathroom, leading to multiple suspensions and one expulsion. The author is feeling bad because the victims were freshmen, around 14-15 years old, who might not fully understand the consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions taken. The school closed a restroom because students were vaping there repeatedly. The author, frustrated by having to walk to another bathroom, later sees a group of students vaping in the other bathroom and reports them. The result is several suspensions and one expulsion. The author feels bad because they think the kids are young and maybe didn't realize the impact of their actions.\n\nOn one hand, the author is reporting illegal activity (vaping in school is against the rules). Schools have a duty to enforce policies to maintain safety and order. By reporting the students, the author is helping the school address a problem. However, the author might be overstepping by not giving the students a chance to correct their behavior. Also, the author might not have considered the consequences of their report, leading to harsh disciplinary actions on minors who might not understand the severity.\n\nBut then, school rules exist for a reason. If students are breaking them, even if they're young, there's an expectation that they follow the rules. The author isn't directly causing the punishments; the school authorities are making that decision based on policies. The author's role was to inform the authorities of a violation, which is their responsibility as a student.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The author was initially upset about the school's decision to shut down a restroom without addressing the root problem. Then, when they saw the same issue happening elsewhere, they took action. The question is whether the author's intention to correct a perceived injustice justifies the outcome. The author might have acted out of a sense of fairness but didn't consider the potential harshness of the school's response.\n\nAnother angle: the author didn't confront the students first or give them a warning. They immediately informed the resource officer, leading to immediate consequences. This could be seen as not allowing the students a chance to learn from their mistakes. But again, school policies might require immediate reporting, and the officer's job is to enforce the rules.\n\nThe key points are: Is reporting a violation of school rules inherently wrong? Are the consequences (suspensions/expulsion) the fault of the author or the school's policies? Since the author is just reporting the incident, they aren't directly in the wrong. However, the ethical aspect is whether they should have taken a different approach, like talking to the students first or addressing the issue in a less punitive way.\n\nAlso, considering the age of the students, there's a debate about whether they should be held as accountable as older students. But legally and in a school setting, policies usually apply uniformly. The author's remorse shows they care about the consequences, but in a legal or ethical standpoint, they might not be wrong for reporting the violation. They might be wrong for not considering alternatives, but the action itself isn't inherently wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they reported a policy violation. However, there's a moral question about their approach, but legally/ethically within the school's rules, they're not at fault.\n"
