So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a high school student who reported other students vaping in a restroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The author feels bad because the students were freshmen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the school. The school had already closed one restroom due to vaping, which suggests they have policies against it. The author found out that the other restroom was being used for the same activity. By reporting this, the author is following the school's rules, so maybe that's on their side.\n\nBut wait, the author mentions they don't have an issue with vaping itself but the fact that the students are doing it at school to impress peers. So the motivation isn't about the act itself but the context. The author thought the school wasn't addressing the problem by just closing a restroom, so they took it upon themselves to report. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? The school's resource officer is there to handle such situations. By reporting, the author is helping enforce rules. However, the consequences were suspensions and an expulsion, which the author feels bad about because the students are young. \n\nBut the school's responsibility is to maintain a safe environment. If the students are violating policies, the school has to act. The author didn't know the exact policies, but by reporting, they're part of the system. The question is about moral responsibility. The author might feel conflicted, but legally or according to school rules, they might not be at fault. \n\nAlternatively, some might argue that the author should have tried to talk to the students first or report through another channel. But since the author saw the violation and reported it, that's a direct way. The school's actions are their own decision, so the author isn't responsible for the severity of the punishments. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They followed the correct procedure by informing the resource officer. The school's response is up to them. So answer B.\n"
