So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for getting several students suspended and one expelled. \n\nFirst, the situation: The school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The writer found another restroom where students were vaping and reported them. The result was suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nSo, the key points here. The writer's motivation was frustration with the school's handling of the problem. They didn't like that the school just shut down the bathroom instead of addressing the real issue. When they saw students vaping in another bathroom, they reported it to the resource officer.\n\nNow, is the writer in the wrong? Well, reporting illegal or school-violating activities is generally seen as a positive action. Vaping in school is against the rules, so the students were in the wrong. The writer didn't encourage or participate in the vaping; they observed and reported it. \n\nHowever, there's a consideration here with the age of the students involved. They're freshmen, 14-15 years old, which is a young age. The writer mentions feeling bad because these kids haven't fully realized how the world works. But the school's responsibility is to enforce rules, and the resource officer's job is to handle such reports. The writer didn't know the extent of the prior offenses, like the fact one kid was expelled for repeated violations. \n\nAnother angle: Did the writer have a duty to overlook this? Probably not. They had a legitimate reason to be frustrated and saw a problem. Reporting it isn't their fault. The school's decision to expel one student might be harsh, but that's up to the school's policies. \n\nIs the writer at fault for reporting the truth? It seems like they're not the one violating rules. They're acting as a responsible student by informing authorities. Even if the consequences are severe, the writer isn't directly responsible for the school's disciplinary actions. \n\nBut maybe some could argue that the writer was vindictive. However, the post states they don't have an issue with the act of vaping itself but with the students doing it to impress peers. So their intent was to stop the rule-breaking, not to target the students. \n\nIn conclusion, the writer isn't in the wrong for reporting the illegal activity. The consequences are up to the school, and the writer's action was within their right to uphold school policies.\n"
