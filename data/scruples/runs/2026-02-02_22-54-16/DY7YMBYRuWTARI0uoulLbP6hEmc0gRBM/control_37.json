So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the school closed down a restroom because students were vaping there. The author is upset because now they have to walk to the other side of the school. Then, when they see some kids vaping in the other bathroom, they report them, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The author feels bad because those were young freshmen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. The school is against vaping on campus, right? So if students are violating that rule, the school has a right to take action. The author reported the incident, which led to the authorities handling it. But the question is whether the author did something wrong by reporting. \n\nOn one hand, the author is following the rules by reporting illegal activity. They might just be doing their duty. But on the other hand, they might have acted out of personal annoyance because they had to walk farther now. Maybe they took it out on the kids. The author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping itself but the fact that the kids are doing it to impress peers. So maybe their motivation is mixed\u2014they want to stop the behavior but maybe reacted more harshly than necessary.\n\nThe kids involved are freshmen, 14-15 years old. The school's action was to shut down one restroom instead of dealing with the root issue. The author's action led to suspensions and an expulsion. Is the author responsible for the school's punishment? They just reported what they saw. The school's decision to expel someone might be their own policy, especially if the student has a history. \n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it differently. Instead of immediately reporting, they could have told a teacher or the resource officer first. But the author did go to the resource officer, which is the right thing to do. However, the act of reporting without maybe giving the kids a chance to stop might be seen as snitching. \n\nIn some contexts, snitching is frowned upon, especially among peers. But if it's illegal activity, then it's encouraged. The line between doing the right thing and being a tattletale can be blurry here. The author might be in the wrong if their main motivation was to get back at the school for closing the restroom. If they were just doing their duty, then not. The story says they didn't have a problem with the vaping itself but the kids' peer pressure. So maybe they're acting out of concern for others or the school's policies.\n\nBut the fact that they say \"screw those guys\" when they report might indicate some personal vendetta. Also, the result is that one kid was expelled. The author might feel bad because the kids are young, but the school's actions are their responsibility. The author isn't the one expelling the student; they're just reporting. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the action was justified because they reported a violation, then no. But if they acted with malicious intent or unnecessarily escalated things, then maybe yes. The answer depends on the intent and the context. Since the author went to the resource officer, which is the correct procedure, they might not be in the wrong. However, if they were motivated by personal annoyance rather than concern for the policy violation, that's a different story. The story seems to suggest a mix of both. The school's initial action was to close the restroom instead of addressing the problem, which annoyed the author. Then they saw others doing the same and reported them. \n\nI think the key here is whether reporting the incident was a responsible action. Since the school had rules against vaping, the author did the right thing. But if they were acting out of spite, maybe they are in the wrong. The story says they didn't have a problem with vaping itself but the fact that the students were doing it to please peers. So they might be acting out of concern for others' behavior. \n\nOverall, reporting illegal activity is generally considered the right thing to do. The school's punishment is their decision. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
