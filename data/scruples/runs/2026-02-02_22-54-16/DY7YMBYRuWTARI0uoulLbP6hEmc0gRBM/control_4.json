So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about high school students vaping in a bathroom that was closed, and the author reports a group of them, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nFirst, the school closed a bathroom because students were vaping there. The author is upset because they now have to walk farther to use the bathroom. Then, they see other students vaping in the remaining bathroom but don't confront them directly. Instead, they tell a resource officer, leading to consequences for the kids.\n\nI need to consider the rules of the school. If the school has strict policies against vaping, then the kids are breaking the rules, and the author is reporting them. However, the author's motivation might be personal\u2014since they have to walk farther now. Could that make their action seem vengeful?\n\nAlso, the kids are freshmen, 14-15 years old, which might mean they're younger and less aware of consequences. The author doesn't have an issue with vaping itself but the fact that the school isn't addressing the problem. But by reporting, they caused severe consequences, including an expulsion. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if they were just following school rules and reporting a violation, they might not be at fault. But if their primary motivation was personal annoyance rather than concern for the rules or the students' well-being, that's a different story. The fact that they didn't confront the kids directly but instead went to an authority figure could be seen as passive-aggressive or using the system against them. Also, the result was suspensions and an expulsion, which might be seen as harsh, especially given the age of the students. The author might feel they were helping, but others could argue they overstepped, especially if they didn't try to address the root issue (like talking to the administration about keeping the bathroom open) before taking action. \n\nSo, considering the school's response and the author's intent, there's a mix of factors. The author might not be in the wrong for reporting a violation, but their personal motive and the outcome could make them seem at fault in the eyes of some. The key points are intent, following rules, and the proportionality of the punishment. Since the school already shut down a bathroom without addressing the root cause, the author's action could be seen as filling that gap, but using punitive measures that resulted in expelling a kid might be excessive. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because of the personal motive and the severe consequences for the students.\n"
