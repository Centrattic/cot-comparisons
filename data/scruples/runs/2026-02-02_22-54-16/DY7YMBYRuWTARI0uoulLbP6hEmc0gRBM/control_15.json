So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author reporting students who were vaping in a bathroom that was closed, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The author is conflicted because the students are young (freshmen, 14-15 years old) and they didn't want to be harsh.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The school closed a restroom due to students vaping there, but the problem continued in the other bathroom. The author walked in, saw the students, didn't confront them directly, but then reported to the resource officer. The question is whether this action was wrong.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the students were violating school rules by vaping. The author reported the violation, which is generally expected in a school setting. However, the author's motivation was partly about the inconvenience of having to walk farther to the bathroom. That might cloud the judgment. But the act of reporting a violation isn't inherently wrong. The school handles the consequences, like suspensions and expulsion, which are their decisions based on their policies.\n\nThe author's concern is about the age of the students. They are young and might not fully understand the consequences. But the school's role is to enforce rules, and the author is a student who followed the procedures by reporting to the resource officer. Even if the author had their own reasons, the action was taken through the proper channel. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have tried to address the issue in a different way first, like talking to the students or involving a teacher before directly reporting to the resource officer. But the story doesn't mention that. The author just reported immediately. However, it's also possible that the author didn't want to confront the students directly, which is understandable given the situation. \n\nThe key points are: the students were breaking rules, the author reported through the correct authority, and the school took disciplinary action. The author's personal inconvenience might have played a role, but that doesn't necessarily make the report wrong. The school's policies are in place for a reason, and students are expected to follow them. \n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't necessarily at fault. They didn't commit a crime; they reported a school violation. The consequences were up to the school's policies. The author's remorse about the students' age is valid, but it doesn't equate to being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B \u2013 the author is not in the wrong.\n"
