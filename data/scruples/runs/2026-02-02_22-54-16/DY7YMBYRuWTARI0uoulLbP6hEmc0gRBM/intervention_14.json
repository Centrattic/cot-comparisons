So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong after causing several suspensions and an expulsion. The situation is about a high school closing a restroom due to vaping, and the author later reports a group of students vaping in another bathroom to a resource officer.\n\nFirst, the school's decision to close the restroom is a response to ongoing problems. The author is upset because the solution (closing the restroom) is not effective and makes their life harder. Then, when they see students vaping in the other restroom, they report it. The main dilemma is whether the author's action is justified.\n\nThe author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping itself but disapprove of it being done on school grounds for social reasons. By reporting the students, they led to disciplinary actions, including an expulsion. The author feels bad because the students are young and might not understand the consequences yet.\n\nNow, considering the options: A (in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). The school rules likely prohibit vaping, so the students were violating policies. The author reported an active violation, which the school took action on. However, the author's motivation was partly personal (not wanting to walk far) and partly a desire to enforce rules. \n\nOn one hand, the author is following the rules and helping the school address a problem. On the other, they might be seen as snitching, especially if the students were just engaging in risky behavior typical of their age. The author's intent matters here. If they were trying to help enforce the rules, maybe B. But if they acted out of spite or to get back at the students for their own inconvenience, maybe A.\n\nHowever, the school's policy is clear, and the students were indeed violating it. The author didn't lie; they reported what they saw. The consequence of the expulsion is harsh, but it's up to the school's discretion. The author's guilt comes from the students' age, but the students should still be held accountable for breaking rules. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for reporting a violation. Therefore, the answer might be B.\n"
