So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a high school student who got multiple freshmen suspended and one expelled for vaping in the bathroom. The user says they don't have a problem with vaping but are upset about the kids doing it to impress peers.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The school closed a restroom due to vaping issues, but the main problem persists in another bathroom. The author witnessed the activity, didn't confront them directly, but instead reported to the school resource officer, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The author feels bad because the kids are young and haven't learned the world's rules yet.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author is not in the wrong. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author is following school rules by reporting the violation. The school's policy is against vaping, and the author's action led to enforcement. The author might have a valid reason for being frustrated with the school's previous action (closing the restroom without addressing the root issue), so reporting seems like a responsible act.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could be seen as going overboard, especially considering the age of the students. Some might argue that the author took a harsh approach instead of trying to educate or resolve the issue with the kids. Also, the act of getting someone expelled might be seen as too severe, especially if the kids were acting out of peer pressure and not malicious intent.\n\nBut the author mentions they didn't confront them directly, which is a bit passive. However, by reporting to the resource officer, they let the school handle the disciplinary action. The school's policy is to expel if there are repeated violations, so the author might not be responsible for the severity of the punishment. The author's intention was to stop the vaping, which is against school rules.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author is following the rules and taking action against what they perceive as wrongdoing. The school's policy is the framework here, so the author isn't violating any rules by reporting. The issue is whether the action was morally right, but the author's perspective is that it's about enforcing rules, not personal vendetta.\n\nConsidering that the author is a student who's affected by the closed restroom and saw others breaking rules, their action to report the incident aligns with maintaining school discipline. The fact that the expelled student had multiple offenses suggests that the school's actions were consistent with their policies. The author's intention wasn't to target specific students but to address a violation they observed.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong because they reported an illegal activity (vaping) in school, which is against the rules. The school's response is their responsibility, not the author's. The author's action was to uphold school policies, even if the outcome is harsh. So the answer is B (No).\n"
