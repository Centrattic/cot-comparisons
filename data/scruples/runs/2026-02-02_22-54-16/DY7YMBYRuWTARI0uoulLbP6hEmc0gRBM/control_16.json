So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a high school that closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author was upset because they had to walk farther for the bathroom. Then, when they saw more kids vaping in the other restroom, they told the resource officer, leading to several suspensions and one expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and the author's intentions. The school had a policy against vaping, so the kids were breaking the rules. The author didn't vape themselves but reported the students. The question is whether the author did something wrong by reporting them. \n\nThe author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping per se but dislike the kids doing it to impress peers. However, the school's rules are in place for safety and policy reasons. By reporting the students, the author was following the school's rules, even if they were annoyed about the bathroom closure. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's motivation might be partially about their own inconvenience with the bathroom closure. But even if that's the case, informing the authorities about a violation is typically considered the right thing to do. However, the fact that the kids are young and haven't learned the consequences yet might make some argue the author was too harsh. But the school's job is to enforce rules, regardless of the students' age. \n\nAlso, the author didn't confront the students directly, just reported them. There's no indication of any malicious intent beyond the school's enforcement. So, the author might not be in the wrong. But maybe there's a nuance. Did the author's action lead to over-punishment? The expelled kid was caught many times, so the school's action might be appropriate. \n\nIn summary, the author reported a policy violation, which is generally the correct action. Unless there was an intention to harm the students, which isn't indicated here, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is probably B (No).\n"
