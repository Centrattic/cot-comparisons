So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vaping incident is in the wrong. The situation is that the school shut down a restroom due to students vaping there, which led to the main character having to walk farther. Later, he sees kids vaping in another bathroom and reports them, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. \n\nFirst, the main point is about whether he did the right thing by reporting. The user says they don't have a problem with vaping itself but with the students doing it to fit in. The author's intention was to address the problem they felt the school wasn't fixing.\n\nNow, considering legality and school rules. If the school has a strict policy against vaping, then the students are violating rules. The author reported them, which led to consequences. But are there factors that make the author wrong? Like, maybe they didn't give the students a chance to stop, or maybe they acted out of personal annoyance (since he had to walk farther). \n\nHowever, the author mentions they didn't have a problem with vaping per se but with the students doing it to please peers. So their motivation is to stop the behavior, not to target the kids. The fact that the school expelled one kid who had been caught multiple times suggests that the school was already planning to take action, just perhaps not as severe. The author's report might have accelerated or escalated the consequences.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for reporting? Legally, they're just reporting a policy violation. However, morally, if the school's approach was to shut down a restroom instead of addressing the root issue, maybe the school is at fault. But the author's action was to follow the rules as set by the school. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have considered confronting the students first or talking to administration about their concerns before taking action. But the story says they didn't think much of it and just reported. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the school's approach might be flawed, but the author's action was within the school's rules. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong), because they're upholding the school's policies. However, the author's personal frustration about having to walk farther might have influenced their decision, but that doesn't necessarily make it wrong. The key is that the students were violating rules, and the author reported it. Unless the author used excessive force or malicious intent, which isn't indicated here, they might not be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
