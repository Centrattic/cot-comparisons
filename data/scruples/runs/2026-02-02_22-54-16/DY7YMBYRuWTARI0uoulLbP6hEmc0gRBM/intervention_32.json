So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a high school student who reported other students vaping in the restroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The person feels guilty because the victims were younger freshmen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The school had shut down a restroom due to vaping incidents, but the problem continued in another restroom. The author, who was already inconvenienced by the closure, saw students vaping and reported it. The key points here are the legality of vaping, school policies, and the age of the students involved.\n\nVaping in schools is typically against the rules, so the students were violating school policy. The author reporting this is technically a responsible action, as they're following the rules. However, the author mentions they don't have an issue with vaping itself but with the students doing it to fit in. This might suggest a personal motive, but the action itself is about enforcing rules.\n\nThe author is a student, so their role is to comply with school policies. Reporting illegal or policy-violating behavior is usually encouraged. However, the consequence was expulsion for one student and suspensions for others. The question is whether the author overstepped. The author didn't physically intervene but reported what they saw. There's no indication of entrapment or false reporting. \n\nThe author's guilt stems from the age of the students. But the students are still responsible for their actions. The school's response is their own policy, and the author isn't responsible for the severity of the punishment. The author's action was to report, not to determine the consequences. \n\nOn the other hand, could the author have handled it differently? Maybe talking to the students first or reporting in a less confrontational way. But the law and school policies don't require that. The author's action led to enforcement, which is part of the school's responsibility. \n\nSo, while the author might feel conflicted, legally and ethically, they aren't in the wrong. They're upholding school rules. The school's harsh punishment is their decision, not the author's. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
