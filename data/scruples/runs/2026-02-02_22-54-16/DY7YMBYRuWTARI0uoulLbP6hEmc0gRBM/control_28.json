So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a student who reported other students vaping in a restroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The key points to consider here are the intentions, actions, and consequences.\n\nFirst, the school had already shut down a restroom because of vaping incidents, but the problem persisted. The author was annoyed because they had to walk farther. Then they saw more vaping in the other restroom and reported it. The author isn't against vaping itself but is against the students breaking school rules. \n\nNow, the question is whether they're in the wrong. On one hand, they were following school rules and reporting the violation. Schools have policies against vaping, and students are expected to comply. The author's action led to consequences for others, but was it justified? The author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping per se, just the rule-breaking. However, they didn't confront the students directly but went straight to the resource officer. \n\nBut then there's the consequence: multiple suspensions and an expulsion. The author feels bad because the students were young (freshmen). The school's response was severe, but the author's action was the catalyst. Did they overstep by not trying to address the issue in a different way first? Maybe. However, they were just reporting an ongoing violation that the school had already been handling by closing a restroom. \n\nAnother angle: the author might have had a personal inconvenience (walking farther) which motivated their action. Is that a valid reason? The school's decision to shut down a restroom didn't fix the problem, so the author took it upon themselves. But the school's responsibility is to enforce rules, not the students. The author's role is to comply with rules. If they see violations, reporting is their duty. \n\nHowever, the severity of the punishments might be the school's fault, not the author's. The author reported the incident, but the school's disciplinary actions are their own decision. The author might not be responsible for the consequences beyond their control. \n\nBut some might argue that the author could have first tried to talk to the students or inform the school in a less confrontational way. Yet, the scenario shows the author directly reported to the resource officer, which is a proper channel. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's action was within their right to report the violation. The school's response is separate from the author's action. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
