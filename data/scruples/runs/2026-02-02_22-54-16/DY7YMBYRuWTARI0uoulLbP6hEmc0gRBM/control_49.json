So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author reporting students vaping in the bathroom, which led to suspensions and one expulsion. The author is conflicted because they were upset about the school's decision to close the bathroom, leading to inconvenience for them. They then saw other students vaping and reported them, causing consequences for the students.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality and school policies. Vaping in school is typically against the rules, so the students were indeed violating the code of conduct. The author's action was to report them, which is usually encouraged. However, the author's motivation might be a factor. They were angry about the school's decision to close the bathroom, which is a school administrative choice. The author might have felt the school wasn't addressing the root problem, so they took matters into their own hands by reporting the students. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? The key points are: 1) The students were actually breaking school rules, so reporting them isn't inherently wrong. 2) The author's personal frustration might have influenced their decision. However, even if their motivation is mixed, the act of reporting illegal activity (vaping) is generally considered right. \n\nBut, there's an argument that the author could have approached the issue differently. Instead of immediately reporting the students, they might have discussed the problem with school authorities to find a better solution. By doing so, they might have avoided the suspensions. However, the author did report the students because they were breaking the rules, which is their right. The school's responsibility is to enforce rules, and the author's action led to that enforcement. \n\nThe author feels bad because the students are young and might not realize the consequences. However, the school's job is to uphold policies, and the author's report is part of that process. The author isn't directly causing the punishment; the school is following its procedures. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they reported a violation of school rules. The school's response is separate from the author's action. The author's mixed motives don't negate the rightness of reporting illegal activity. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
