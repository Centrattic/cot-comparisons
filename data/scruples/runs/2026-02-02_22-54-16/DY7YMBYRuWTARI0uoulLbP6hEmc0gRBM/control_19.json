So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the school closed a restroom because students were vaping there, and the author was upset because they had to walk further to the bathroom. Then, the author saw kids vaping in another bathroom and told the resource officer, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the actions. The author reported the students for vaping. Vaping in school is against the rules, right? So maybe they were just doing their part by reporting the violation. But on the other hand, the author was upset because the school didn't address the original problem by closing the first restroom. The author might have felt like the punishment wasn't fair, so they took matters into their own hands by reporting the new incident.\n\nBut wait, is it right to anonymously report others? The author didn't confront the kids directly but told the resource officer. The kids were freshmen, 14-15 years old. The author feels bad because they were young and might not fully understand the consequences. But the school's job is to enforce rules regardless of the students' ages. If the author reported a violation, that's their responsibility. However, maybe the author's motivation was partly about their own inconvenience, which could be a factor. But the main issue is whether the act of reporting was wrong.\n\nAlso, the author says they don't have a problem with vaping itself, just the fact that the students were doing it in school to impress peers. So the author's intention was to stop the rule-breaking, not the vaping itself. The school's response was to expel one student, which is harsh, but the author didn't decide the punishment\u2014just reported the incident.\n\nConsidering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because they reported a violation. However, maybe there's a gray area because they were influenced by their own frustration with the school's previous decision. But in terms of right or wrong, reporting a known violation seems correct, even if the outcome is severe. The school's responsibility is to handle discipline, so the author's action was following the rules. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that the author should have addressed the issue through proper channels first, but the story says the author went to the resource officer directly. So I think B is the answer."
