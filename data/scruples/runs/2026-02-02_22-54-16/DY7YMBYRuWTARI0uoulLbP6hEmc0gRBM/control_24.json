So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the school closed a restroom because students were vaping there, and the author was upset because they had to walk further now. Then they saw kids vaping in another bathroom and told the resource officer, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and the author's actions. The school has a policy against vaping, and students are breaking that. The author reported them, so they're following the rules. But maybe the author's intention was not just to stop the vaping but also to get back at the school for closing the restroom. The author mentions they were \"pissed\" because the school didn't punish the kids before, just closed the bathroom. So, there's a bit of a motive here. \n\nThen, the author says they don't have a problem with vaping per se, but the kids are doing it to impress peers. So, the action was to stop the rule-breaking. But the result was suspensions, including an expulsion. The author feels bad because the kids are young and maybe didn't realize the consequences. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, they reported a violation, which is their right. But maybe there's a consideration about the intent. If they did it out of spite because the school closed the bathroom, that could be problematic. But the post says they didn't think about it and just acted. If the school is enforcing rules, and the author is helping enforce them, then maybe they're not wrong. However, if they were acting out of personal frustration rather than a genuine concern for the rules, that could make them at fault. \n\nAlso, the fact that they didn't confront the kids themselves but went directly to the resource officer\u2014maybe that's overstepping. But again, if the school wants violations reported, then that's acceptable. The key issue is intent. If the author's main issue was the inconvenience of the closed bathroom and they wanted to retaliate against the school's handling, then it's more selfish. But if they genuinely wanted to stop the vaping, even if they were upset before, then it's a different story. \n\nI think the line between doing the right thing and using the situation for personal reasons is blurry here. The author might be in the wrong if their primary motivation was to get back at the school rather than stop the vaping. However, since they did report the actual violation, which the school was supposed to address, maybe they're not entirely wrong. But the fact that they were upset about the bathroom closure and then took this action could imply some vindictiveness. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because their actions were partially motivated by personal frustration rather than a genuine effort to uphold rules. But others might argue it's still the right thing to report. It's a bit of a grey area, but the mention of being \"pissed\" and the result being harsh penalties for freshmen might tip it towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
