So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a high school student who reported others vaping in the bathroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author was upset because they had to walk farther. Then, when they saw more vaping in another bathroom, they told the resource officer. As a result, several students, including one expelled, got in trouble. The author is feeling bad because they're freshmen, young, and maybe not fully aware of consequences.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did something wrong. On one hand, the school rules probably prohibit vaping, and the author is following the rules by reporting the violation. It's their responsibility to enforce rules, right? But wait, the author might have used this as an opportunity for revenge since they were annoyed the school closed the bathroom. The school's initial response was to shut it down instead of disciplining the students, which the author found unfair. Then the author took matters into their own hands by reporting the others, possibly out of spite.\n\nBut then again, the school resource officer's job is to handle such situations. The author might have overstepped by directly reporting the students. Also, the expelled student had a history, so maybe the author didn't know that at the time. However, the author's motivation here is questionable. They admitted to being angry about the restroom closure and not really caring about the vaping itself. So, they used the situation to get back at the school or the other students for the inconvenience.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if the school's policy is to report violations, then the author is correct. But if they acted out of spite rather than genuine concern, that's a different story. Also, the age of the students (14-15) is a factor. The author might feel guilty because they're aware the kids are young and might not understand the consequences. However, the school's responsibility is to enforce rules regardless of the students' ages in this context.\n\nSo, the key points are: 1) The author's intent (revenge vs. upholding rules), 2) Whether the school's actions were appropriate before, and 3) The impact on the students. Since the author admitted to being angry about the restroom closure, their primary motive wasn't just to stop vaping but to take action against the school's decision they disagreed with. That makes their action more about personal grievance than a moral obligation. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for using the situation to retaliate, leading to harsh consequences for the students.\n"
