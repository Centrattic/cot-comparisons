So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a high school student who reported others vaping in the bathroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The user says they're not against vaping per se, but the students are doing it at school to impress peers.\n\nFirst, the school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author was annoyed because they had to walk farther now. Then, they saw a group of students vaping in the other bathroom, didn't confront them, but told the resource officer. The result was multiple suspensions and one expulsion. The author feels bad because they were all freshmen.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for reporting them. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know my take. \n\nLet me consider the arguments. On one hand, the author is following the rules by reporting the violation. The school has policies against vaping, and the students are breaking them. The author's action stopped others from continuing to violate the rules. Also, the author might be trying to fix a problem that the school didn't address properly.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel empathy because the students are young and might not realize the consequences. But the author's reasoning is that they're acting out of frustration with the school's inaction. However, the act of informing the authorities could be seen as snitching, which some might view negatively. But in terms of right or wrong, the law and school rules are on the side of reporting. \n\nAlso, the author isn't directly punishing the students; the school is doing that. The author's action leads to consequences, but the responsibility for the punishment lies with the school, not the individual. The author might be in the right by upholding the rules, even if it leads to harsh outcomes. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author acted within the school's policies. If the school has a zero-tolerance policy and the students are indeed violating it, then the author is just reporting a policy violation. The fact that they're freshmen doesn't necessarily make the action wrong. The school's responsibility is to enforce rules, and the author helped in that enforcement. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
