So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The school closed a restroom because students were vaping there, which the author thinks didn't solve the problem and inconvenienced him. Then he saw other kids vaping in the other bathroom, told the resource officer, leading to multiple suspensions and one expulsion. The author feels bad because they were all freshmen, 14-15 years old.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but wants my opinion. I need to decide A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nHmm. Let's consider angles. The author didn't vape, just reported others. But was it justified? The school's action to close a bathroom and then students found another spot. The author's action led to punishments. But is the author wrong for reporting? Vaping in school is against rules, so reporting is a civic duty. However, maybe the author had a grudge because the closure affected him. But he mentions he's not against vaping personally, just the violation. \n\nAnother angle: Maybe the author is a snitch, but in some contexts, that's seen as doing the right thing. The expelled kid was caught many times, so maybe deserved it. The author's intention was to address the problem, not target the freshmen specifically. \n\nBut the author feels bad because they're young and naive. However, the school has policies, and enforcing them is part of their job. The author's action followed the policy by reporting. So from a legal and school policy standpoint, the author did the right thing. \n\nBut is there an ethical issue? The author might have acted out of personal inconvenience. However, the action still addressed the school's rules. So maybe not in the wrong. Therefore, answer B.\n"
