So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a high school student who reported other students vaping in the bathroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The key points to consider here are the student's intentions, the consequences of their actions, and the school's policies.\n\nFirst, the author is upset because the school closed a restroom instead of addressing the root issue of students vaping there. Then, when they saw others vaping in the other restroom, they reported it, leading to disciplinary actions. The author feels bad because the victims were freshmen who might not understand the consequences yet.\n\nOn one hand, the author's actions led to suspensions and an expulsion, which could be seen as harsh, especially for minors. But on the other hand, they were following school rules by reporting the violation. The school's policy probably prohibits vaping, so the author isn't breaking any rules by reporting. However, the author might be in a position where they could have handled it differently, like talking to the kids first or informing a teacher before involving the resource officer. Also, the author's motivation was partly about their own inconvenience, which might affect how others perceive their intent.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally and according to school policy, they might not be. But morally, if the author's actions caused unnecessary harm to the students (like expulsion) without addressing the underlying issue (vaping culture), some might argue they're complicit in a system that's too harsh. However, others might say that the school is responsible for enforcing rules, and the author was just upholding them.\n\nI need to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). Considering the author followed the rules and reported the violation, even if it led to harsh consequences, they might not be in the wrong. But the fact that they admitted to feeling only slight concern about the other students' well-being might tip it towards A. Hmm. Alternatively, the school's harsh response isn't the author's fault; they just followed up. So maybe B is correct. But some might argue that the author should have considered the impact on the kids. I think it's a bit of a toss-up. The answer likely depends on the perspective taken. Since the school policies are in place, and the author didn't create the system, maybe B is the right choice.\n"
