So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported the vaping kids is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author was annoyed because they had to walk farther for the bathroom. Then, the author saw more kids vaping in the other bathroom, didn't confront them directly, but instead told the school resource officer, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nThe key points here are the author's actions and motivations. The author claims they don't have a problem with vaping itself but with the kids doing it to impress peers. They didn't stop the kids themselves but reported them to authorities. \n\nIs the author's action a betrayal or a responsible one? Some might argue that they're being a tattletale, especially since they didn't try to handle it themselves first. Others might say they're doing the right thing by ensuring school rules are followed. However, considering the age of the students (freshmen, 14-15) and the fact that the school's initial solution was to close a restroom instead of addressing the root cause, the author's frustration is understandable. But by reporting without trying to address it directly, maybe the author could have handled it differently. \n\nBut the school's role is to enforce rules, so the author's report led to consequences. The author might feel conflicted because they understand the kids are young and not fully aware. However, the school's actions (expulsion) are severe. The author's responsibility is questionable because they didn't try to warn the kids first. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if the school's rules are being broken, the author isn't wrong for reporting. But maybe they could have approached it differently. However, the question is about being in the wrong. If the action was within the school's policies, then the author isn't in the wrong. The answer might lean towards not being in the wrong because they're following rules, even if the outcome is harsh. But others might say they should have handled it more diplomatically. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer is B (not in the wrong) because they reported a violation, which is their right. However, there's a nuance that the approach could have been better. But legally and according to school policies, the author isn't wrong. Hence, the answer is B.\n"
