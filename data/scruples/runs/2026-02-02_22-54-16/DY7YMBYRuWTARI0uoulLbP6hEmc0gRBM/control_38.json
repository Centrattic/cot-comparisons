So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for getting multiple kids suspended and one expelled by reporting them for vaping. So, the situation is that the school closed a restroom because kids were vaping there, but the problem moved to another bathroom. The author, annoyed by having to walk farther, saw a group of freshmen vaping and told the school resource officer, leading to suspensions/expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. Vaping in school is against the rules, right? So the kids were violating school policy. The author reported them, which led to consequences. But the author might feel bad because they're just kids, 14-15 years old. The question is whether the author did the right thing.\n\nOn one hand, the school is responsible for enforcing rules. If the author didn't report, the problem would continue. The school might not be proactive, so the student took initiative. On the other hand, the author might have acted out of personal inconvenience (having to walk farther) rather than concern for the rules. Also, some might argue that the school's approach of shutting a bathroom didn't solve the problem, and the author's intervention was excessive, especially causing one kid to be expelled after multiple offenses. \n\nBut, the author didn't know the history of the kids when they reported. They just saw a violation and reported it. The school had the authority to take action. The author might feel conflicted because the kids are young, but the school's policies are in place for a reason. However, some might say the author is taking justice into their own hands, but in this case, they reported to school authorities, which is a proper channel. \n\nThe key points: the author reported a violation, which is their right. However, their motivation (personal annoyance) and the outcome (expelling a freshman) could make them feel responsible. But legally and according to school policies, they were following the rules. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. However, maybe there's a moral aspect where they should have talked to the kids first or reported to teachers instead of the resource officer directly? But the post says they went to the resource officer, which is the correct step. \n\nAnother angle: the author didn't confront the kids directly but went straight to the officer. If they had warned the kids first, maybe the outcome would be different. But the question is about being in the wrong. Since the act of reporting the violation isn't illegal or against school policy, the author isn't in the wrong. The school's decision to expel is up to them. So the answer is B.\n"
