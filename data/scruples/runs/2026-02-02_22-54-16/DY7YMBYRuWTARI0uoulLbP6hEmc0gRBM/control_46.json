So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a high school student who reported other students vaping in the bathroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The author is conflicted because they feel like they're right in stopping the vaping but upset about the consequences for the freshmen.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The school closed a restroom because students were vaping there, but the author found another bathroom where kids were still vaping. Instead of reporting it to the right authorities, the author told a school resource officer, leading to several suspensions and one expulsion. The author is worried because the students were freshmen, so young, and maybe not fully aware of the consequences.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). To decide, I should consider a few things: the rules of the school, the intent behind the author's actions, the age of the students involved, and the proportionality of the punishment.\n\nThe school's policy: Closing the restroom was their response to the initial vaping. Then, when the author found another group, they took it upon themselves to report it. The school resource officer (SRO) is the appropriate authority, so reporting there might be correct. But the author didn't go through the usual channels like a teacher or administrator first. They directly involved the SRO, which led to immediate consequences.\n\nIntent: The author's motivation was to solve the problem since the school's approach didn't work. They wanted to prevent vaping and were frustrated by the inconvenience. However, their method was to involve law enforcement, which escalated the situation. The author might argue they were doing the right thing by stopping the rule-breaking, but using the SRO instead of school staff could be an issue.\n\nAge of the students: The victims are 14-15, which is a young age. Schools often handle first-time or repeated offenses with some leniency for minors, especially if it's a behavioral issue. The fact that one was expelled suggests a history, which the author didn't know about. The author might not have considered the long-term effects on these kids' lives.\n\nProportionality: The punishments (suspensions/expulsion) could be seen as harsh for vaping, especially if the school's policy is strict. The author's action led to these severe consequences, which they now regret. The initial problem (vaping) is against school rules, but the response might be disproportionate.\n\nMoral vs. Legal: Legally, the author might be in the right for reporting a violation. But morally, they might be in the wrong for not considering the students' ages and the severity of the consequences. The author's intent was to stop the behavior, but the method caused significant harm to others.\n\nSchool's Responsibility: The school should have addressed the issue properly. If they failed by just closing a restroom, maybe they're at fault. But the author taking matters into their own hands might not be the right approach. The school has systems in place for reporting issues; bypassing those to go directly to law enforcement could be problematic.\n\nEthical Dilemma: The author is caught between doing what they believe is right (stopping vaping) and the unintended negative outcomes. They might feel they were helping, but their action led to serious consequences for others. This is common in moral questions where the right action isn't clear.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's action led to severe consequences for minors. While they reported a violation, the method and outcome might make them partially responsible. The answer could lean towards A (yes, in the wrong) because they didn't use the proper reporting channels and didn't consider the students' ages and the harshness of the punishment. Alternatively, B (not wrong) if they followed school procedures through the SRO, which is a legitimate authority. However, since the SRO is part of the school's authority, maybe it's still appropriate. But the key is whether the author should have reported through the correct channels first. If the SRO is the correct authority, then the author isn't wrong. But if the school has a different process (like reporting to a teacher), then the author's action was wrong. The Reddit post doesn't specify if the SRO was the right contact. Since the author went to the SRO, who is the school's resource officer, that's probably the right step. However, the outcome's harshness might not make the author wrong, but the question is about their responsibility. The author might not be in the wrong for reporting, but they could still feel bad about the consequences, which is a common situation in AITA posts. The answer might be B, not in the wrong, because they reported a violation, even if the consequences were severe.\n"
