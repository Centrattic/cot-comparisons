So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author did something wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe school closed a restroom because kids were vaping there. The author didn't like that because it made their life harder, making them walk to another part of the school. Then, they saw a bunch of freshmen vaping in the other bathroom, didn't confront them directly, but told a school resource officer. As a result, some kids were suspended and one was expelled. The author is questioning if they're at fault because the kids are young and maybe didn't realize the consequences.\n\nFirst, let's consider the rules. Vaping in school is against the rules, right? So if the school is trying to enforce that, then the students are in violation. The author didn't directly confront them but reported the incident to the school resource officer. That seems like they're following the proper channels. But the author also had a motive of being inconvenienced by the closed restroom. So is it right to report others because you're upset about a policy you disagree with?\n\nThe author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping itself but with the students doing it to please peers. So maybe the author's issue is with the peer pressure aspect. But regardless, the action taken was to report, which led to suspensions/expulsions. The question is whether the author's action was justified.\n\nOn one hand, the author is upholding school rules, which is a duty of students. On the other, the author's personal frustration might have influenced their decision to report. But even if that's the case, the action was still within the school's policies. The author didn't use violence or harsh words; they just informed the authorities.\n\nThe fact that the expelled student was caught multiple times might mean that the school's action was proportional. The author might feel bad because the kids are young, but the school is responsible for enforcing rules consistently. If the author didn't report, it might encourage others to continue violating the rules.\n\nHowever, is it the author's responsibility to enforce the rules in that way? Maybe the school should have been more proactive. But the author's action led to consequences, so should they feel guilty? The author's intention might be to fix the problem they were facing, but by reporting, they caused others to be punished. But if the school's policy is in place, then the author isn't wrong for following it.\n\nIn conclusion, the author reported a violation of school rules through the correct channels, leading to disciplinary actions that the school deemed appropriate. While the author might feel some guilt, they aren't necessarily in the wrong for doing what they thought was right by the rules.\n"
