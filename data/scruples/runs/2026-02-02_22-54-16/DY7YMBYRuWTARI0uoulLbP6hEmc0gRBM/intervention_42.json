So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by reporting the vaping students, leading to multiple suspensions and an expulsion. The author is a high school student who was frustrated because a bathroom was closed, making their daily routine harder. They witnessed other students vaping in a different bathroom and decided to report it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The school had already shut down a restroom due to vaping incidents, which the author found unfair. The author reports the new incident, thinking it's the right thing to do. The school then takes disciplinary action, including expelling one student. The author feels bad because the students involved are young and might not fully understand the consequences.\n\nNow, legal and moral aspects. Legally, reporting illegal activity like underage vaping is not a crime. The students were breaking school rules and laws, so the author is acting as a whistleblower. However, there's a moral consideration here. The author's motivation is partly personal frustration with the inconvenience caused by the closed restroom. They might have a point in feeling that the school isn't addressing the root problem. But by reporting, they caused consequences for others.\n\nAnother angle: Did the author have a duty to report? In a school setting, students are generally encouraged to report violations. The author didn't escalate without reason; they observed the violation and informed an authority figure. However, the outcome affects minors, some of whom might have been repeat offenders. The author's knowledge that one was expelled might add to their guilt, but they might not have known the full backstory at the time.\n\nPotential for over-punishment: Schools might have policies that lead to harsher consequences than necessary. The author's action could lead to disproportionate punishment for students who are still young. But the school's responsibility is to enforce rules, and the author isn't directly responsible for the school's policies.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping itself, but with the students doing it to impress others. That suggests they're not reporting out of dislike for vaping but for enforcing rules. However, the personal inconvenience might have influenced their decision, which could be seen as a conflict of interest, but not necessarily wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's action might have been driven by personal frustration, reporting illegal activity is generally the right thing to do. The school's response is their own policy, and the author isn't to blame for that. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
