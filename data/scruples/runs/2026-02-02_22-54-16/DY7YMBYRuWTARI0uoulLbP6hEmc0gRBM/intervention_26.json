So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a high school student who got several fellow students suspended and one expelled for vaping in a bathroom. The school had already closed one restroom due to repeated incidents, but the problem continued. The author, frustrated with the inconvenience, reported a group of students vaping in the alternate bathroom when they saw the school resource officer. The author's main concern is that the students were freshmen, so young, and maybe not fully aware of the consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author acted wrongfully. The key points here are: the school had a policy against vaping, the bathroom was closed because of prior violations, and the author took it upon themselves to report the incident. The school's action was to enforce existing rules. The author didn't create the situation; they reported what they saw. However, the author's motivation was partly due to personal inconvenience, which might question their intent. But legally, vaping in school is against the rules, so reporting it isn't inherently wrong. The author didn't use force or coercion, just informed the resource officer. The fact that the students were young is a point the author considers, but that's a consequence of the school's enforcement, not the author's direct fault. The author didn't know the extent of the infractions beforehand, so they might not be responsible for the severity of the punishment. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they reported a violation of school rules, even if motivated by personal annoyance, it's generally not their fault. The responsibility lies with the school for the policy and consequences. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
