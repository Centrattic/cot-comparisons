So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vaping incident is in the wrong. The situation is that the school closed a restroom because students were vaping there, but the problem continued in another bathroom. The author saw a group of freshmen vaping, told a school resource officer, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and the author's intent. The school has a policy against vaping, so the students were violating that. The author's action was reporting the violation. The question is whether the author is wrong for doing so. \n\nThe author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping itself, but disapprove of the students doing it to impress others. Their motivation seems to be about enforcing school rules rather than personal vendetta. However, the consequence was harsh\u2014expulsion for one student. The author feels bad because the students are young and not fully aware of the consequences.\n\nPossible angles: Was the author justified in reporting? The school's policy is to address the issue, so reporting seems right. But the author might be seen as a snitch, and the outcome was severe. However, the school's policy is in place, so the author is just following it. \n\nOn the other hand, the school's response (closing the bathroom) was ineffective, so maybe the author thought it was necessary to take action. The students were violating rules regardless of the previous closure. The author's action led to consequences, but that's part of the school's discipline process. \n\nThe author's feelings of guilt stem from the age of the students, but the responsibility for the punishment lies with the school, not the reporter. So, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting the incident. The answer is B.\n"
