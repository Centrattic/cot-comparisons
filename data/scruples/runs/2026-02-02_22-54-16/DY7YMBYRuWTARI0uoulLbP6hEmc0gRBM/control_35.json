So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vaping incident is in the wrong. The situation involves a high school closing a restroom due to students vaping, leading the author to report another group vaping in the remaining bathroom, resulting in expulsions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The school closed a restroom because students were vaping, but instead of addressing the root issue, they shut down the bathroom. The author felt this didn't solve the problem and was inconvenienced by having to walk to the other bathroom. When they saw more students vaping there, they reported it. The result was multiple suspensions and one expulsion. The author is conflicted because the students are young and may not understand the consequences.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the author's intent was to address the problem they saw, but they didn't confront the students directly. Instead, they informed the resource officer, leading to severe consequences. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author saw illegal activity (vaping is prohibited in schools) and reported it, which could be seen as responsible. On the other hand, the students are young, and the author might have overreacted, especially since the school's initial response was to close a restroom rather than enforce rules properly. The author's frustration with the school's approach might have influenced their decision to report, but does that make them wrong?\n\nI should also consider if there's a duty to report illegal activity. If vaping is against school policy and the law, then reporting it is the right thing. However, the author could have first tried to talk to the students or inform a teacher before escalating. By directly reporting to the resource officer, they might have contributed to harsh consequences without giving the students a chance to correct their behavior. The fact that the author didn't confront them first might be a point against them.\n\nMoreover, the school's handling of the situation is part of the problem. Closing a restroom instead of addressing the behavior could lead to more hidden vaping. The author's action might be a symptom of the school's ineffective policies. But the author isn't responsible for the school's decisions. Their responsibility is their own action\u2014reporting the incident.\n\nThe ethical aspect here is about proportionality. The author reported a violation, which is right, but the outcome was expulsions. If the expulsions were too harsh, maybe the school's punishment is the issue, not the author's report. The author can't control the consequences, only their action of reporting. So, in that case, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting the illegal activity they witnessed. However, one might argue that they should have handled it differently, like speaking to a teacher first. But in many cases, reporting to authorities is the correct step when witnessing violations.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting the illegal activity. The school's response is a separate issue. The author's action was to uphold the rules, even if the consequences were severe. So the answer is B (No).\n"
