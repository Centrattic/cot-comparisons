So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for getting multiple kids suspended and one expelled after reporting a group of students vaping in the bathroom. The school had already closed the main restroom where this was happening before, so they moved to another bathroom. The user saw the group vaping there, told the resource officer, and then the school took action.\n\nFirst, the user's intention was to address the issue of vaping, which the school had previously handled by closing a restroom. The user felt personally inconvenienced because they had to go to the other side of the school. But the main problem here is the students vaping on school grounds, which is against the rules. The user didn't do anything illegal, just informed an authority figure. However, the user is feeling bad because the kids are freshmen, around 14-15, and maybe they think it's harsh for the school to expel someone for repeated offenses.\n\nBut let's think: the school's responsibility is to enforce rules for all students. If the user is following the rules by reporting it, they aren't in the wrong. The consequences the students face are the school's decisions based on their policies. The user didn't set out to get kids expelled; they were just doing their part to report a known issue. Even if they didn't like the previous solution (closing a restroom), the right action is to report ongoing violations. The fact that one kid was expelled because of repeated offenses is the school's policy, not the user's doing. So the user isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
