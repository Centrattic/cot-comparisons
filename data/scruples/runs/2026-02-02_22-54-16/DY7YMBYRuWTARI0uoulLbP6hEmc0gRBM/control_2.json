So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a high school student who got other students suspended or expelled by reporting them for vaping in the bathroom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The school closed a restroom because students were vaping there, but the problem moved to another restroom. The author, frustrated by having to walk across the school, saw kids vaping again and reported them. The result was several suspensions and one expulsion. The author feels guilty because the kids are young (freshmen) and maybe didn't realize the consequences.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author reported the students, leading to disciplinary actions. The question is about whether reporting them was wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the school has rules against vaping, and the students were breaking those rules. The author is enforcing the rules by reporting, which is technically their right. The school's response might be strict, but the author isn't the one setting the punishments. However, the author's motivation was personal frustration\u2014because the problem moved to another area affecting their convenience. That might be seen as using the school's system for personal gain, which could be problematic. \n\nBut then again, the students were indeed violating school policies. The author isn't directly punishing them; they\u2019re just informing the authorities. The school's decision to expel someone who had prior offenses is their responsibility. The author might not be at fault here because they\u2019re following the rules.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's action might be considered tattling for personal reasons. The fact that they don't have a problem with vaping themselves but are upset about the inconvenience of walking to the bathroom complicates things. It could be seen as hypocritical or using the school's authority in a way that's not entirely fair to the students, especially since the punishment is harsh (expulsion). The author might not have considered the kids' ages or their intentions, but they aren't the ones deciding the punishment.\n\nI think the main issue is whether the author acted in good faith. If they genuinely believed the students were breaking rules, then they\u2019re not wrong. But if their primary motive was personal annoyance, then it could be seen as misuse of authority. However, since the school has the rules in place, the author's action is technically correct, even if the motivation was self-serving. The school handles the consequences of the report, so the author isn't directly responsible for the expulsion. Therefore, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
