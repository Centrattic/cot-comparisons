So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a high school student who reported a group of freshmen vaping in a bathroom, leading to their suspension and one being expelled. The author feels bad because the kids are just 14-15 and not fully aware of the consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the school. Vaping is against school policies, so the students were breaking the rules. The author reported them because they saw the officer. But the user is questioning if the author is at fault here.\n\nThe key points are: the author didn't have a problem with vaping itself but with the fact that the students were doing it to impress peers. Also, the school had already closed one restroom due to similar issues, and the author was inconvenienced by having to use a different restroom. \n\nThe author didn't confront the students themselves but informed the resource officer. The consequences were suspensions and an expulsion. The author's intention was to stop the behavior, but they feel guilty because the students are young. \n\nFrom a legal and school policy perspective, the author did the right thing by reporting the violation. However, the moral aspect is more complex. The students were young and might not understand the seriousness. The author's action led to severe consequences, but the students were still in the wrong for violating the rules. The school's decision to expel one student might be strict, but the author isn't necessarily at fault for following the rules. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they reported a violation, even if the outcome was harsh. The responsibility for the consequences lies with the students and the school's disciplinary actions.\n"
