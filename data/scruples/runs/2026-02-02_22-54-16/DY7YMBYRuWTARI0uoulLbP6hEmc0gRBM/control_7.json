So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. \n\nFirst, the school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author was upset about the inconvenience because they had to walk to another part of the school. Then, when they saw kids vaping in the other bathroom, they reported them to the resource officer, leading to suspensions and one expulsion. The author feels bad because the kids are freshmen who haven't fully realized how the world works.\n\nThe key points here are about the author's actions and their consequences. The author didn't do anything illegal, but maybe their intention was the problem. They were motivated by personal frustration (having to walk further) rather than a genuine concern for the school's rules or the well-being of the students. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nOn one hand, the author could be seen as doing the right thing by reporting illegal activity (vaping in school). Schools have policies against vaping, and the resource officer's job is to enforce those. So the author might be following the rules. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's main motivation was personal inconvenience. They were upset about the restroom closure and took out their frustration by reporting others. That could be seen as a vindictive or spiteful action. Also, the consequences were severe\u2014expulsions and suspensions\u2014which might be harsh, especially for minors who are still learning. The author didn't consider the impact on the students, just their own annoyance. \n\nAnother angle is whether the author had a responsibility to address the issue through proper channels first. Instead of reporting the kids, maybe they should have talked to administration about reopening the restroom or finding another solution. By going straight to reporting, they caused consequences without addressing the underlying issue they were upset about.\n\nBut then again, the school's policy is clear about vaping, and the author is just following the rules. If others are violating the rules, they have a right to report it. However, the author's personal vendetta aspect complicates things. The line between doing the right thing and acting out of spite is blurry here.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping itself, but with the kids doing it to impress peers. That could imply a judgment based on the kids' motivations rather than the act itself. But the school's policy is against vaping regardless of the reason.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if the author didn't know about the severity of the consequences, maybe they aren't at fault. However, they should have considered that reporting could lead to serious actions. The fact that they didn't think about the kids' ages or the impact shows a lack of empathy.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's actions followed the rules but were motivated by personal annoyance. The consequences were severe, and the author didn't consider the students' situations. Therefore, while they aren't breaking any laws, their intent and lack of empathy might make them at fault. So, the answer might be A (yes, they are in the wrong).\n"
