So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a high school student who reported others vaping in the bathroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The person is feeling conflicted because they think the school didn't address the root problem and now the kids (freshmen) are being punished.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the school's policies. If the school has rules against vaping, then the students are breaking those rules. The person who reported them might be just enforcing the rules. But the situation is complex because the school previously shut down a restroom rather than dealing with the problem, which the author found frustrating. \n\nThe author's motivation is important. They were annoyed because they had to walk farther to the bathroom. But when they saw the vaping, they didn't confront the kids themselves but instead told the resource officer. The user mentions they don't have a problem with vaping itself but with the kids doing it to \"please their peers.\" So maybe the author's issue is with the underage vaping in school, not the act of vaping per se.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, they're reporting a violation of school policies. On the other hand, they might be contributing to harsh consequences for young students who might not be aware of the seriousness. The author feels bad because the kids are young and haven't \"realized how the world works.\" But the school is responsible for enforcing policies, and the officer is there to handle such issues. \n\nHowever, the author's actions led to suspensions and an expulsion. The question is whether they overstepped. Since they reported what they saw, which is a common practice in schools, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if the school's approach is to ignore past issues, and the author is now causing severe consequences, perhaps they should have considered the kids' ages and maybe tried to address the problem differently, like talking to them first. \n\nBut the user's action was to inform the officer, which is a standard way to address such issues. The school's decision to expel someone who was caught multiple times might be a separate issue. The author might not be directly responsible for the expulsion, just the reporting. However, the author might feel guilty about the outcome, especially with the younger students. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the line is blurry. The author followed the school's procedures by reporting to the resource officer. So, technically, they might not be in the wrong. But ethically, considering the age of the students, they might feel conflicted. The answer would depend on whether the action of reporting the incident is considered wrong. Since they didn't do anything illegal or against school policy, the answer might be No (B). However, if the school's policy was not being enforced before and the author's action caused disproportionate consequences, maybe A. But the user's action was to report the violation, which is usually expected. So probably B."
