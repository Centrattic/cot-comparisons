So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation is about a high school student who reported other students vaping in the restroom. The school shut down a restroom previously because of this, leading to the student's frustration. The student then went to another restroom, saw more vaping, and reported it to a resource officer. As a result, several students were suspended and one was expelled. The author feels bad because the kids are freshmen, around 14-15, who might not fully understand the consequences.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the student followed the rules by reporting the violation. Schools have policies against vaping, and students are expected to comply. Reporting the activity is a responsible action, especially since the students are breaking school rules. The author didn't encourage or participate in the vaping; they just informed the authorities, which is typically seen as the right thing to do.\n\nOn the other hand, the consequences were severe\u2014expulsion for one kid. The author might feel that the punishment is harsh, especially since they mention not having an issue with the act itself but the violation of school rules. However, the school's policy likely dictates the severity based on prior offenses. The author didn't know about the expelled student's history, so they might not be responsible for the school's disciplinary actions.\n\nAlso, the motivation of the author is important. They were frustrated because the school's previous action (closing the restroom) didn't resolve the issue, and they had to inconvenience themselves. Their decision to report was based on their belief that the school wasn't addressing the problem. Even though their intent was to solve the issue, they followed the proper channels by informing the resource officer.\n\nPotential counterarguments could be that the author didn't try to talk to the students first or warn them, but the scenario doesn't mention that. The school's rules require reporting violations, so not reporting could be seen as complicity. The author's action aligns with the school's policies even if the outcome is harsh.\n\nAnother point is the age of the students. They are young and might not realize the consequences, but the school has to enforce rules consistently. The author's responsibility isn't to judge the severity of the punishment but to enforce the rules they are aware of.\n\nIn conclusion, the author acted according to the rules and reported the violation, which is their duty as a student. The severity of the punishment is up to the school's discretion, not the reporter. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
