So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author reporting kids vaping in a bathroom, which led to multiple suspensions and one expulsion. \n\nFirst, the school closed a restroom due to vaping by freshmen. The author, frustrated because they now have to walk farther for the bathroom, later sees more students vaping in the other bathroom and reports them. The author doesn't have an issue with vaping itself but is upset about the school's handling of the problem and the impact on themselves.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author reported the incident to a resource officer, leading to punitive actions. The question is whether the author is wrong for doing so.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, reporting illegal or prohibited activities, like vaping in a school, is generally encouraged. Students are supposed to follow school rules, and if they're violating them, it's up to authorities to handle it. However, the author's motivation might be a factor. They were upset about the inconvenience caused by the closed bathroom. But does that make the report malicious? Not necessarily. They might have a personal stake, but the act of reporting itself isn't inherently wrong.\n\nEthically, it's a bit more complex. The author mentions not having a problem with vaping itself, but the kids are doing it to impress peers. The author might feel it's against school rules regardless. The consequences were severe (expulsion of a repeat offender), which the author now feels bad about because the kids are young and maybe didn't realize the consequences. However, the school's responsibility is to enforce rules consistently. If the author is a good Samaritan, they might feel justified in reporting to help maintain school policies. But if they did it out of spite, that's different. The author's frustration seems to be about the school's initial inaction and their own inconvenience, but they didn't know the outcome would be an expulsion. \n\nAnother angle: Did the author overstep by not confronting the kids first or giving them a chance to stop? They chose to report directly. But school policies might require immediate reporting. Also, the officer's role is to handle such situations. The author might have done the right thing by informing the officer, as it's part of the school's process.\n\nIs there any wrongdoing? The author didn't use violence or coercion; they just reported what they saw. The school's decision to expel a student is their discretion, based on the student's history. The author isn't responsible for the school's disciplinary actions beyond reporting the incident. So, while the author might feel conflicted, legally and ethically, they might not be in the wrong for reporting a violation they witnessed. However, if there was intent to harm or a pattern of snitching, that's different. But from the post, it seems more like a genuine concern for school rules and personal frustration.\n"
