So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for getting multiple students suspended and one expelled. The situation involves the school closing a restroom due to students vaping, and then the author, frustrated by this, goes to another restroom and sees kids vaping there. Instead of confronting them directly, the author tells the school resource officer, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The school initially shut down a restroom because students kept vaping there, but the problem moved to another restroom. The author is upset about the inconvenience but also wants to address the issue. When they see kids vaping in the new location, they report it. The key point is whether reporting the students is wrong.\n\nThe author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping itself but with the students doing it at school to fit in. They feel guilty because the students are young (freshmen, 14-15 years old). The main ethical question here is whether ratting out peers is justified, especially when it leads to harsh consequences like expulsion. \n\nOn one hand, the author is upholding school rules, which is their responsibility. If the school has a strict policy against vaping, reporting it could be seen as doing the right thing. On the other hand, the author might be seen as snitching, which can create a negative environment among peers. Also, considering the age of the students and their immaturity, some might argue that the school should handle the situation with more understanding or that the author's action was a harsh response to a problem the school initially mishandled by just closing the restroom instead of addressing the root cause.\n\nAnother angle is the school's initial response. Closing the restroom didn't solve the problem; it just moved it. The author's frustration with the school's ineffective solution might influence their decision to take matters into their own hands. However, the right action is to report violations, even if the system is flawed. The problem is whether the punishment fits the action. If the school's policies are too strict, leading to expulsion for a first-time offense, that's a different issue. But the author isn't responsible for the school's policies, just for their action of reporting.\n\nThe author's guilt stems from the age of the students, but that's a separate ethical consideration. Legally and according to school rules, the students were in the wrong. The author's action led to consequences, but it's not clear if the author acted maliciously. They might just be trying to follow the rules as they were taught.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the action of reporting is considered snitching or upholding rules. In many school settings, students are encouraged to report rule violations. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, even if the outcome is harsh. The school's policy and enforcement are the bigger issues here. The author's action aligns with their role as a student trying to maintain the rules, even if it causes stress for others. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). However, there's a valid argument that the author could have handled it differently, like reporting discreetly or discussing with teachers first, but the act of reporting itself isn't wrong.\n"
