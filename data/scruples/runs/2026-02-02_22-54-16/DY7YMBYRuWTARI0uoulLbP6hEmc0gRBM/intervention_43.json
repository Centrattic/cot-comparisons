So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a student who reported others vaping in a school bathroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The writer is conflicted because they feel like they're not in the wrong but want to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The school closed a restroom due to vaping incidents, which frustrated the student because it made their life inconvenient. When the student noticed more vaping in the other bathroom, they reported it. The consequences were severe, including an expulsion. The writer is worried about the age of the students involved (14-15 years old) and their lack of maturity.\n\nNow, evaluating the situation: Reporting illegal or prohibited activities, like vaping in school, is generally seen as a responsible act. Schools have rules against vaping, and students are expected to follow them. The writer didn't engage in any harmful behavior themselves; they just informed the authorities about a violation. However, the writer's motivation might be questionable\u2014part of their reason was personal inconvenience (having to walk to the other side of the school), which could imply some self-interest.\n\nBut is self-interest a valid reason to be in the wrong? In many cases, people report misconduct regardless of their reasons, as long as the act itself is legitimate. The school's response was to enforce rules, and the writer's action led to that enforcement. The writer isn't breaking any rules by reporting, so they aren't in the wrong in that sense.\n\nThe other aspect is the age of the students. They're minors, and maybe the school should consider that when disciplining. However, the school's responsibility is to enforce rules consistently. If the expelled student had prior violations, the school might have deemed expulsion necessary regardless.\n\nCould there be an alternative approach? The writer could have tried talking to the students first or informing a teacher earlier. But in the moment, they chose to report it, which is a direct approach. Since the writer didn't act out of malice and was following school rules, their action isn't wrong. The consequences might be harsh, but the writer isn't the one deciding the punishment\u2014only reporting the incident.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The writer acted within their rights to report a school policy violation, even if the outcome was severe. Their personal frustration might have played a role, but the act itself is justified.\n"
