So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a high school student who reported other students vaping in a restroom, leading to multiple suspensions and one expulsion. The person is conflicted because the students were freshmen, around 14-15 years old.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the school. If the school has a policy against vaping, then the students were breaking the rules. The school closed a restroom because they caught students there. The author got upset about the inconvenience and then later reported a group they saw vaping in another restroom. \n\nThe key points here are the school's policies and the author's intent. The author didn't do anything illegal, just reported what they saw. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" Maybe the author's action was justified in enforcing the rules, but the consequence of expelling a student who had prior offenses might be harsh. The author might feel guilty because they didn't know one of the kids had a history. \n\nBut the author didn't know about the prior offenses. Their intent was to report a rule violation, which they have a right to do. The school's punishment might be too severe, but that's the school's decision. The author isn't responsible for the school's disciplinary actions. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have addressed the issue through proper channels first, like telling a teacher instead of directly confronting the students or reporting them. But in the story, the author saw the officer and reported the incident, which is the right procedure. \n\nThe main issue is whether the author acted wrongfully. Since they followed the rules by reporting the violation, even if the consequences were severe, they might not be in the wrong. But others might say that they should have considered the consequences and maybe tried to resolve the issue more leniently. \n\nBut according to the information given, the author's action was to uphold the rules, even if it led to harsh outcomes. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong). But I need to be careful because sometimes intentions and consequences matter. The author didn't know about the expelled student's history, so their action was just reporting what they saw, which is acceptable. So the answer is B.\n"
