So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about getting multiple kids suspended and one expelled for vaping in a bathroom after the school had already closed another bathroom to prevent this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of the author. They saw students vaping in the remaining bathroom and reported it. The school's response was to close the first bathroom but not address the root problem. The author then decided to inform the school resource officer, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe author's motivations are important here. They mention being frustrated because the school didn't fix the problem, making it inconvenient for them to use the bathroom. They also clarify they don't have an issue with vaping itself but with the students doing it to impress peers. However, they didn't confront the students directly but instead went straight to the resource officer.\n\nNow, considering the ages of the students involved\u2014freshmen, 14-15 years old. They might not fully understand the consequences of their actions. The author's action led to severe penalties, including expulsion. Was the author justified in reporting them? If the school has rules against vaping, then the students are violating those rules. However, the author's intent was more about their own inconvenience than addressing the actual policy violation. \n\nIs the author responsible for the consequences? If they reported a violation, they might not be in the wrong for enforcing school rules. But if they did it out of personal frustration rather than a genuine concern for the policy, maybe they are acting as a tattletale. However, the school resource officer's job is to enforce rules, so the author is just reporting what they saw. On the other hand, the author could have first tried to talk to the students or inform a teacher in a more direct way instead of immediately involving authorities. \n\nThere's also the aspect of whether the school's initial response was inadequate. Closing a bathroom but not addressing the root issue (students vaping) led to the problem persisting. The author's action might have been a result of the school's failure to handle the issue properly. However, the author's responsibility is to follow the school's procedures. If the school's policy is to report such incidents, then the author is following protocol. \n\nBut the key point is the author's intent. If they are acting out of spite or personal annoyance rather than genuine concern for the rules, that's different. However, the author does mention that the students were vaping to please peers, which could be a concern. The line between doing the right thing and being a snitch can be blurry here.\n\nIn terms of legal or moral responsibility, the author isn't breaking any laws by reporting the violation. However, the moral aspect depends on their motives. If the main reason was their own inconvenience, then it might be seen as inconsiderate. But if they genuinely believe in upholding school rules and the students' actions have consequences beyond just inconvenience, then it's a different perspective.\n\nAnother angle is the school's role in this. If they closed a bathroom but didn't enforce rules properly, the onus is on the school to manage the situation. The author's action could be seen as a response to the school's inaction. However, the author is a student and isn't responsible for the school's policies. \n\nConsidering all these factors, the author might not be in the wrong for reporting a policy violation. However, the method and motivation could be questioned. But since the school has the authority to enforce rules, the author isn't necessarily at fault. The answer might be B (No), but there's some nuance here.\n"
