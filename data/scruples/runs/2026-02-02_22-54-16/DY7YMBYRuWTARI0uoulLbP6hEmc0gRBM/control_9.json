So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a high school student who reported others vaping in a restroom, leading to multiple suspensions and one expulsion. The writer is conflicted because they're upset about the school's initial decision to close a restroom instead of addressing the root issue, then they took action by reporting a group of students. They feel bad because the kids are freshmen, 14-15 years old.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects here. The school has rules against vaping, and the students were violating those rules. The writer reported the violation, which led to consequences. But the writer's motivation was partly about their own inconvenience (having to walk farther for the bathroom) and frustration with the school's inaction. \n\nIs the writer in the wrong for reporting the students? Well, they didn't know they were breaking the law; they were following school policy. However, their intent might be a factor here. If they did it out of spite or for personal reasons, that could be problematic. The writer mentions they don't have an issue with vaping itself but with the students doing it to fit in. But the main reason they acted was to address the school's failure to fix the problem. \n\nThe school's action of closing the restroom without addressing the underlying issue is questionable, but the writer took matters into their own hands. Reporting the violation isn't illegal, but the context of their motivation\u2014personal frustration and wanting revenge on the school's handling\u2014might make their action ethically questionable. \n\nHowever, the school is responsible for enforcing rules, and the students were indeed violating them. The writer's action led to consequences, which the school administered. But the writer now feels bad about the outcome, especially affecting minors. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the writer isn't breaking any laws, but the ethical stance is more nuanced. If the writer acted with bad intentions, like seeking revenge or causing trouble, then it could be seen as wrong. However, if they genuinely wanted to report a rule violation they witnessed, then it's a civic duty. The confusion comes from the writer's own motivations and the school's initial inaction. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the writer's intent and the proportionality of the outcome justify their actions. Since the students were violating school rules and the writer reported them, technically they aren't in the wrong. However, the ethical judgment might be more complicated. But according to the options given (A or B), the answer would be B, No, because the writer isn't in the wrong legally or ethically for reporting a rule violation they observed.\n"
