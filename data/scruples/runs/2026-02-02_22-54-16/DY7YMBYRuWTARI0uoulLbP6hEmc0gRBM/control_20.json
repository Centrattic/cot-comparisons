So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a high school that closed a restroom because kids were vaping there. The author got annoyed because they now have to walk to the other side of the school, and when they saw a group vaping in the other bathroom, they told the resource officer. As a result, many kids were suspended and one expelled. The author is upset because they were freshmen (14-15 years old) and maybe not fully aware of the consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the school. If the school has a policy against vaping, then the students caught are violating those rules, regardless of their age. The author's action was reporting the violation, which is a responsible thing to do. However, the author might feel guilty because the consequences were harsh, especially for younger students.\n\nBut wait, the author didn't confront the kids; they just went to the officer. That's part of their responsibility as a student to report illegal or against-school-policy activities. The school's decision to expel someone for repeated offenses is their own policy, not directly the author's fault. The author might not have considered that, but the main question is whether they did something wrong by reporting it.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's motivation was partly about their own inconvenience. They were annoyed because of the new rule affecting their routine. Is that a valid reason? Well, even if they were annoyed, if they saw the rule being broken, they have a duty to report it. The kids were using the bathroom for an illegal activity, so the author's action is justified.\n\nNow, the author might be in the wrong if they intentionally set a trap or if they exaggerated the situation. But according to the story, they just went in, saw the kids vaping, and reported it. They didn't provoke the situation, just informed an authority. The school's response is up to them, and the author can't control how the school punishes the students. \n\nHowever, there's a social aspect. The author might have considered that some kids might not know the rules, but the school already had a policy in place. The fact that the kids were caught multiple times implies they were aware. So the author's action prevented further violations. \n\nBut the author feels bad because the kids are young. Shouldn't they report it regardless of the kids' age? If the school has strict rules, then the punishment is their responsibility. The author did the right thing by reporting, even if it led to suspensions. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they reported a violation, which is a responsible action. The school's response is their own policy, and the author didn't act maliciously. They might feel conflicted, but they weren't in the wrong.\n"
