So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting several students suspended and one expelled. The situation is about vaping in a restroom that was already closed because of similar issues. The author went to another restroom, saw kids vaping, told the resource officer, and then a bunch got punished.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the school's rules. Vaping in school is typically against the rules, so the students were violating that. The author reported them, which is reporting a violation. But the author might be in the wrong if they used underhanded methods or if their intent was malicious.\n\nWait, the author didn't confront the students directly but instead told the resource officer after leaving. Was there any entrapment or trickery? The user mentioned they didn't say anything to the students when they saw them, just left and then reported. That seems like a straightforward report rather than entrapment.\n\nThe author feels bad because the students are young (freshmen, 14-15). But the school's responsibility is to enforce rules. The author's action might be seen as doing the right thing by upholding school policies, even if it leads to harsh consequences for minors. However, some might argue that the author could have talked to the students first or handled it less harshly.\n\nBut according to the scenario, the author didn't have a problem with vaping itself but with the students breaking the school rules. The school's decision to close the restroom didn't stop the behavior, so the author took action. Reporting is a legitimate way to address rule violations. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
