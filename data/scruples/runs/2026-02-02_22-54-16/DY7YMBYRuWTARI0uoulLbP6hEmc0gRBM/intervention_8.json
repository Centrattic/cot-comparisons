So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a student who reported others for vaping in the school bathroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The question is whether the author did the right thing.\n\nFirst, the school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author is upset because they now have to walk further to use the bathroom. Then, the author sees a group of students vaping in the other restroom and tells the resource officer, which leads to consequences for those students. The author feels bad because they're all freshmen, so they're young and maybe didn't realize the seriousness.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. On one hand, the school has rules against vaping, and the resource officer is there to enforce them. By reporting the students, the author is helping the school address the problem that the closure didn't fix. The author might believe they're upholding the rules and ensuring a safer environment. On the other hand, the students are young, and maybe the author is being overly strict. However, the author mentions they don't have a personal issue with vaping but with the students breaking school rules to impress peers. \n\nBut was it the author's responsibility to intervene? The author could have chosen to ignore it, but they decided to inform the officer. The consequences were severe, like expulsion, which the author now regrets. However, the school's policy might call for such actions if the student has a history. The author might not have known about the expelled student's past offenses. \n\nThe key points are: the school's responsibility to enforce rules, the author's intent (helping vs. revenge), and the impact on the students. If the author's action was in line with school policy and the students were indeed violating it, then the author isn't in the wrong. If the author acted out of spite, maybe, but the context suggests they were trying to address a problem they were affected by. So, probably the author isn't in the wrong, hence answer B.\n"
