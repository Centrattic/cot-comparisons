So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong after getting several kids suspended and one expelled by reporting them for vaping in a bathroom. The author's reasoning is that the school shut down a restroom, which annoyed them because they had to walk farther. When they saw kids vaping in the other bathroom, they reported them to the resource officer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the school's rules. Vaping is typically against school policies, so the students were violating rules. The author didn't do anything illegal by reporting them. However, the age of the students is a factor\u2014they're 14-15, which is a minor age. The author might feel bad because they're peers or because the punishment seems harsh. The school's response (expulsion) might be considered strict, but the school has the authority to enforce their policies. \n\nThe author's motivation was frustration with the school's handling of the issue, leading them to take action. But is reporting a violation of school rules a wrong action? If the school allows students to report incidents, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the action was done with malicious intent, that's different. The author claims they didn't have a problem with vaping but with the students' actions in school. \n\nAnother angle: the school's decision to close the restroom instead of disciplining individual students might have led to a false sense of security, and the author is holding them accountable. But the author's action resulted in severe consequences for the students, which could be seen as overstepping if they intended to cause harm. However, since the school enforces these rules, the author's report is within their right. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether reporting the violation is considered wrong. Legally and ethically, if the school promotes a policy where students can report violations, the author isn't in the wrong. The harshness of the punishment is more about the school's response than the author's action. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
