So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the school closed down a restroom because students were vaping there, which made the author have to walk further to the bathroom. Then the author saw more students vaping in the other bathroom and told the school resource officer, leading to suspensions and one expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. Vaping in school is against the rules, right? So the students were already breaking the rules. The author reported them, which is typically the right thing to do. But the author is feeling bad because the kids are freshmen, young, and maybe didn't realize the consequences. \n\nBut wait, the school already took action by closing the bathroom instead of punishing the students, which might have led to more students vaping elsewhere. The author's action stopped this behavior. However, was it right to report them? The author didn't know if the officer would take action. \n\nOn one hand, the author is following the rules and helping enforce them. On the other, the kids are young, and the school's initial response was to close the bathroom instead of addressing the root issue. The author's action might have been a justified report of illegal activity. \n\nBut maybe the author should have considered talking to the students first or reporting it anonymously through a proper channel. However, the story says the author just told the officer, which is a direct approach. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the school's policies are in place and the students were violating them, then the author isn't wrong for reporting. The fact that they felt conflicted shows they care, but the action itself might be justified. The answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong. But maybe there's a nuance where the author could have handled it differently, like discussing with a teacher first. But since the officer was present, acting then is appropriate. So probably B.\n"
