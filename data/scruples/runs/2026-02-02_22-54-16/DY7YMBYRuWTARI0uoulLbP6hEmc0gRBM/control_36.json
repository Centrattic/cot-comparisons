So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author reporting a group of students vaping in a bathroom, leading to several suspensions and one expulsion. The author is feeling bad because the students are all freshmen, around 14-15 years old.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and policies of the school. The school had shut down a restroom because students were vaping there, but the problem continued. The author then decides to report the ongoing issue when they see more students vaping. The author's intention might be to address the problem they felt the school wasn't handling properly. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, reporting illegal or school-policy-violating activities isn't inherently wrong. However, context matters. The author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping per se but with the students doing it to impress peers. The author's action led to severe consequences for the students, especially the expulsion of one who had prior violations. The author feels conflicted because the students are young and might not realize the consequences.\n\nPossible angles: Was the author justified in reporting? Did they overstep by not addressing the school first? The school had already closed the restroom, maybe indicating they were aware but hadn't acted on other instances. The resource officer was present, so perhaps the author could have approached them directly instead of taking matters into their own hands. But the author did inform the officer, which might be appropriate. \n\nHowever, considering the age of the students and the potential for the author to have handled it differently\u2014like talking to the kids first or reporting through proper channels\u2014could affect the judgment. The author's intent was to solve a problem, but the outcome was harsher than expected. The ethical aspect here is about responsibility and consequences. Even if the action was legal, the author might be in a gray area because the students are minors and the punishment is severe. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the school's policy allows for such actions and the author followed the correct procedure by informing the resource officer, then maybe not. But if the author acted out of spite or without considering the kids' ages and circumstances, that's another layer. The fact that the author felt bad afterward suggests internal conflict. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer might hinge on whether the author's actions were in line with school policies and if they considered the consequences. Since the author reported an ongoing issue that the school had previously failed to address, they might not be entirely at fault. However, the outcome's severity for young students could imply that the author should have handled it differently. But since the resource officer was involved, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer is B (No).\n"
