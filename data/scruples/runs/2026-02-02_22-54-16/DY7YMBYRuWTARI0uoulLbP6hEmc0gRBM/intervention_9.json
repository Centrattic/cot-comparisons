So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a high school student who shut down a bathroom because of vaping, then later went to another bathroom and saw more kids vaping. The author reported them, leading to suspensions and an expulsion, and now feels bad because they were all freshmen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the school's rules. If vaping is against school policy, then reporting it is technically following the rules. The author might be in the right for enforcing school policies. But then again, maybe there's a gray area here. The author was upset that the school didn't fix the problem by shutting down the bathroom, so their motivation might be partly about personal inconvenience. That could be a point against them. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping itself but with the students doing it to impress peers. So they're taking a stand against peer pressure. But did they have the right to report the kids? If the school expects students to follow rules, then reporting is part of that. However, the consequences were severe\u2014expulsion for one kid. The author might not have considered the impact on the students, especially since they're freshmen. \n\nAnother angle: the author didn't confront the vapers themselves but went straight to the resource officer. That's maybe a responsible action. But was it necessary? If they felt the school wasn't addressing the issue, maybe they acted out of frustration. The author's own experience of having to walk farther because of the closed bathroom added to their frustration. \n\nIn some schools, students are encouraged to report misconduct. So the author isn't necessarily wrong for doing that. But the emotional aspect of their decision\u2014personal annoyance with the inconvenience\u2014might make people question their motives. However, the main action was reporting an illegal activity (vaping in school), which is generally right. \n\nThe key points are: the school's policy enforcement, the age of the students, and the severity of the punishment. If the punishment was too harsh, maybe the author should have considered that. But since they didn't know about the expulsion until later, maybe they can't be blamed for that outcome. \n\nSo, weighing all these factors, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they reported a policy violation, even if their motivation was partly personal. But some might argue A because of the youth of the students and possible over-policing. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not the school's actions. Since the author followed the rules, they might not be in the wrong.\n"
