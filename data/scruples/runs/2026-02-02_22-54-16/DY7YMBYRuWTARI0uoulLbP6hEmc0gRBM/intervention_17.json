So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the school closed a restroom because students were vaping there, but the author is upset because they now have to walk farther. They saw a group of freshmen vaping in the other restroom and reported it, leading to suspensions and one expulsion. The author feels bad because the kids are young and haven't realized the consequences yet.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: the school's response to vaping (closing the restroom vs. punishing students), the author's motivation for reporting (personal inconvenience vs. actual enforcement), and the consequences (suspensions/expulsion of minors). \n\nFirst, the school's action of closing the restroom instead of punishing the students might have been a way to avoid harsh disciplinary measures, which the author finds frustrating. The author then takes it upon themselves to report the ongoing vaping, possibly to bypass the school's ineffective solution. But the question is whether they are in the wrong.\n\nThe author doesn't have a problem with vaping itself, just that it's happening on school grounds. So their intention was to enforce the rules. However, the result was multiple suspensions and an expulsion of 14-15 year olds. The author is regretting the outcome because the students are young. \n\nNow, from a legal standpoint, the school probably has rules against vaping, and the resource officer is there to enforce them. So by informing the officer, the author is technically following the rules. But the ethical angle is trickier. The author's main grievance was the school's approach, so they took action to address what they saw as a loophole. But did they overstep? \n\nIf the author reported the students without being a tattletale, but because they thought it was right, maybe they're not wrong. However, if their action was driven by personal annoyance (having to walk farther) rather than genuine concern, that could be seen as self-serving. Also, the severity of the punishment\u2014expelling a kid\u2014might be an unintended consequence. The author might feel responsible for that, even though they didn't know beforehand how many times the kid had been caught. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. So I need to weigh the intent against the outcome. If the school's policy is to report such incidents, then the author did their part. However, if the school's method of closing the restroom was meant to avoid punishment and the author is undermining that, maybe they are interfering with the school's administrative decisions. But the school's method might also be flawed if it's just moving the problem elsewhere. \n\nAlso, the age of the students plays a role. If the author knew or should have known they were reporting minors who might face severe consequences, does that affect their responsibility? It's possible that the school should handle youth issues more leniently, but the author's action might be justified if they were following the rules as set by the school. \n\nSo, the answer could depend on the school's policies and the author's intent. The author's intent was to report rule-breaking, which is right. The unintended consequence is the harsh punishment, but the author didn't know that. So maybe they aren't in the wrong. Alternatively, if the school's policy is to not report and just close the restroom, then the author is acting against that policy. But the school's policy might be ineffective, so the author's action could be seen as necessary. \n\nI think the main issue here is the school's approach versus the author's enforcement. The author's action leads to consequences, but if the school's rules are clear that vaping is prohibited and needs to be reported, then the author is correct. If the school intended for the issue to be addressed without such strict measures, then maybe the author's action disrupted that. However, the school's closure of the restroom didn't stop the problem, so the author might have a point in trying to address it. \n\nIn terms of ethics, some might argue that the author is taking moral responsibility for the students' actions, which is commendable. Others might say that the author is being judgmental or using the situation to get back at the school for their own inconvenience. The author's comment about \"screw those guys\" suggests a level of spite, which could be a factor. \n\nBut the author's own admission that they don't have a problem with vaping, but rather with the students doing it on school grounds, shows they're not targeting the kids for personal reasons. They just wanted to enforce the rules. However, the outcome is harsh, and they're now feeling guilty. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's action was in line with the school's rules (reporting vaping), but the motivation might be seen as mixed (both helping and personal annoyance). The school's policy might have contributed to the problem by not enforcing consequences. The author's guilt over the expulsion is valid, but if they followed the rules, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, if they knew the harshness of the consequences and still chose to report, maybe they should have considered that. \n\nBut the author didn't know the kid would be expelled. They just did what they thought was right. So in that case, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But if there's a school policy that they shouldn't have reported because the principal decided to handle it another way, then maybe A. However, the story says the school shut the restroom but didn't punish the students. The author then reports the ongoing issue, which the school might not have been aware of. So the author is helping the school enforce the rules. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B.\n"
