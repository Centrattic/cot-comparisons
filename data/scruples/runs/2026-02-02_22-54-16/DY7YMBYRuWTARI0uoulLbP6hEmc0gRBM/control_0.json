So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for causing multiple suspensions and one expulsion by reporting students vaping in the bathroom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author was annoyed because they now had to walk farther. Later, they saw a group vaping in the open restroom and reported them. The result was suspensions and an expulsion. The author feels bad because the kids are just 14-15 and maybe not fully aware of the consequences.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, they followed the school rules by reporting the violation. If the school has a policy against vaping, then reporting it is a responsible action, especially if the school isn't addressing the issue effectively. The author might believe they're upholding the rules and helping the school maintain discipline.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't confront the students directly but went straight to the resource officer. Some might argue that they could have tried to talk to the kids first or inform a teacher in a different way. Also, considering the age of the students, there's a concern about whether the punishment is too harsh. However, the school's decision to expel one student was based on prior offenses, not just this incident.\n\nThe author's motivation seems to be a mix of frustration with the school's previous inaction and personal inconvenience. But the action taken was within the school's policies. Unless there's an element of malicious intent or violation of procedures, the author isn't necessarily wrong. However, some might argue that they overstepped by not giving the students a chance to explain or correct their behavior.\n\nBut legally and by school policy, reporting illegal or prohibited activities is the right thing to do. The school's response is their responsibility, not the reporter's. So the author isn't in the wrong for acting within the system's rules. The moral aspect is complex, but legally or according to school policies, they're probably in the right. However, the Reddit audience might have mixed opinions based on the consequences for the students.\n"
