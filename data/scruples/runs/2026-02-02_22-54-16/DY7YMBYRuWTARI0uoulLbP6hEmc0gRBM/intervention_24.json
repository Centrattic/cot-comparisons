So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting several kids suspended and one expelled. The situation is that their school closed a restroom due to vaping, which the author found inconvenient. Then, when they saw kids vaping in another restroom, they reported it, leading to the suspensions/expulsion.\n\nFirst, the author's motivation was frustration over the school's handling of the problem. They didn't report the first time they saw the closed restroom, but then when they saw others vaping, they reported it. The key points here are intent and consequences. The author isn't vaping themselves but is upset about others breaking the rules. They might have felt the school wasn't doing enough, so they took action.\n\nThe question is about whether they're in the wrong. Legally, reporting illegal or rule-breaking activities is usually encouraged. However, morally, there's a consideration of the consequences. The kids are freshmen, around 14-15, which are young. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing by preventing vaping, but the outcome was severe punishments.\n\nBut the author didn't set out to get the kids expelled; they just reported what they saw. The school decided the punishments. The author's intent was to address the problem they saw, maybe because they were affected by the restroom closure. However, the author might have overstepped by not considering the kids' age and the potential harshness of the school's response. \n\nOn the other hand, the school is responsible for enforcing rules. The author provided information, and the school acted on it. The author's action was a report, not the punishment itself. So maybe they're not in the wrong for reporting. But the feeling of guilt because the kids are young adds a moral dilemma. The author might have been in a position to report but didn't consider the consequences. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the school has to handle violations, and the students are accountable for their actions. The author's role was to inform, which is their right. However, the author might have acted out of personal frustration rather than a genuine concern for the students' well-being. That could be a point against them. But the line between right and wrong here is blurry. The answer hinges on whether the intent justifies the outcome. If the author's intent was to help the school enforce rules, then they might be in the right. If it was to take out frustration on others, maybe not. The user mentioned they don't have a problem with vaping but with the students doing it to please peers, so the intent is to stop rule-breaking. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's action was a report, which is generally acceptable. The school's decision to expel is separate. The author's guilt stems from the outcome, not their action. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
