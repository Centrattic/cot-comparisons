So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vaping incident is in the wrong. The situation involves a high school closing a restroom due to students vaping there. The author then reports another group of students vaping in a different restroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the school's policies. If the school has rules against vaping, then students are violating those rules by vaping on school premises. The author reported the violation, which led to consequences for the students involved. The question is whether the author overstepped by getting involved.\n\nThe author mentions not being against vaping personally but against the students breaking school rules. Reporting illegal or rule-breaking activities is generally seen as responsible. However, the consequences (suspensions/expulsion) might seem harsh, especially since the students are freshmen. The author feels bad about this, showing some remorse.\n\nOn the other hand, the school's initial response was to close a restroom instead of addressing the root issue through discipline. The author's action could be seen as filling that gap by reporting the ongoing violation. However, using school resource officer to enforce consequences might have been a direct approach. The author didn't confront the students but informed the authorities, which is a legitimate action.\n\nConsidering that the students were underaged and possibly making mistakes, the severity of the punishment could be debated. But the author's role here was to report the violation. The school's responsibility lies in determining the appropriate punishment. The author isn't directly responsible for the disciplinary actions taken beyond reporting the incident.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting the violation. They followed the correct procedure by informing the authorities. The consequences are up to the school, which the author didn't control. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
