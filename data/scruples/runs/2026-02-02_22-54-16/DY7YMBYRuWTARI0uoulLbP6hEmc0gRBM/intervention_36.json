So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a high school student who reported peers vaping in the bathroom. The school had already closed down a restroom because of this, and now the author had to walk to another bathroom. When they saw more kids vaping there, they told the resource officer, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The author is upset because the kids are freshmen, young, maybe not fully aware of the consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. If the school has a policy against vaping, then the students were indeed breaking the rules. The author reported them, which is technically following the rules. But the author is conflicted because the consequences were severe\u2014expulsion for one kid. The question is whether the author did the right thing by reporting, even if it led to harsh punishments.\n\nPossible angles: Was the author justified in reporting? Maybe they felt the school wasn't addressing the problem properly. On the other hand, maybe the author's motivation was more about personal inconvenience (having to walk to the other bathroom) rather than just enforcing rules. Also, the fact that the author didn't vape themselves but was against the kids doing it for peer approval complicates things.\n\nIs it the author's responsibility to report? In some schools, students are expected to report violations. If the school had a clear policy that students should report such incidents, then the author did the right thing. But if the author acted out of spite or to get back at others, maybe not. The author says they \"didn't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing it at the school to please their peers,\" so the intent was to stop the behavior, not just punish for vaping itself. \n\nHowever, the consequences were severe. Expelling a 14-15 year old over this could be seen as harsh, especially if it's a recurring issue but not their first offense. The author might feel guilt because the punishment doesn't fit the crime. But legally and according to school policy, if the resource officer followed procedure, the author isn't at fault. The author's role was to inform; the school's handling of the cases is their responsibility. \n\nAnother point: the author didn't confront the kids themselves but reported to the officer. That seems appropriate. If they had confronted the kids and things got physical, that would be different. Here, it's a straightforward report. \n\nSo, in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the author followed the school's protocol. The school's response might be questionable, but the author isn't responsible for that. The author's action was to address a problem they had with the school's initial response. The guilt might stem from empathy but not from wrongdoing in their actions.\n"
