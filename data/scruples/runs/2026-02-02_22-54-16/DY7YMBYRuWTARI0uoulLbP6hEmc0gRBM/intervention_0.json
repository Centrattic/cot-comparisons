So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the school closed a restroom because students were vaping there, but the author was upset because they now have to walk to the other side of the school. Then, when they saw a group of kids vaping in the other bathroom, they told the resource officer, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and responsibilities. The school has a policy against vaping, and the author reported the students. On one hand, the author was following the rules by reporting the violation. But on the other hand, they were motivated by personal inconvenience (having to walk farther) rather than a concern for the students' well-being. That might be a problem because maybe they didn't consider the consequences of their actions on the kids.\n\nThe author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping itself but with the kids doing it to impress peers. However, their action led to severe consequences, including an expulsion. The kids are all freshmen, 14-15 years old, who might not fully understand the implications. The author might be overstepping if their motivation was self-serving. \n\nBut is it wrong to report illegal or policy-breaking activities? The school is supposed to enforce rules, and the officer is there to handle such situations. If the author had just walked out and didn't report it, maybe the school wouldn't have taken action. By reporting, they helped enforce the rules, but the outcome was harsh. The question is whether the author should have taken responsibility for the consequences. \n\nAlso, the school's initial response of closing the restroom instead of addressing the root problem (students vaping) is part of the context. The author was upset about that, so their frustration might have led to the decision to report. But that doesn't necessarily make the reporting wrong. \n\nIn some cases, people might argue that the author's intent was to solve their own problem rather than help the school, so it's self-serving. However, others might say that regardless of the motive, reporting the violation is the right thing to do. \n\nThe key factors here are the author's intent, the school's responsibility, and the outcome's severity. If the school's policies are clear and the resource officer is supposed to handle such reports, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. But if the author acted out of spite or to cause trouble, that's a different matter. The author says they just thought \"screw it\" and went to report, which might indicate a lack of consideration for the consequences, which could reflect poorly on them.\n\nIn the end, the answer depends on whether the action was justified despite the outcome. If the school's rules are in place and the author is following them, then B (not in the wrong). But if the action was driven by personal annoyance and led to harsh consequences without due process, maybe A (in the wrong). It's a bit of a gray area, but I'm leaning towards B because the author reported a violation, even if their motives weren't entirely altruistic.\n"
