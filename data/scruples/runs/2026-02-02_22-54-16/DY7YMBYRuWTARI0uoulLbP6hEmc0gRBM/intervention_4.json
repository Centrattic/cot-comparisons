So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a high school student who got multiple kids suspended and one expelled for vaping in a bathroom. The school had already closed one bathroom due to similar issues. The author was upset about the inconvenience and decided to report the group they saw vaping in the other bathroom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the school. If vaping is against school policy, then the students who were vaping were indeed breaking the rules. The author reported them, which led to suspensions and an expulsion. The key points here are whether the author's actions were justified and if there was any wrongdoing on their part.\n\nThe author didn't participate in the vaping but chose to report it. They might have felt frustrated because the school's decision to close the bathroom didn't solve the problem. By reporting, they were following the rules and possibly trying to address the issue they were facing. However, there's a question about motive. The author mentioned they were annoyed by having to walk further to the bathroom, which could be seen as a personal grievance driving their action. But even with that, they didn't engage in any harmful behavior themselves; they just informed the authorities.\n\nThe expelled student had a history of violations, so the school's strict action might be appropriate. The author might feel bad for the younger students, but they weren't the ones enforcing the punishment. The school has the authority to take disciplinary actions, and the author's role was to report the incident. There's no indication that the author lied or exaggerated the situation. So, from a moral standpoint, even if the motive was partially self-serving, the act of reporting illegal or policy-violating behavior isn't inherently wrong. However, some might argue that the author should have addressed the issue through proper channels instead of directly confronting the situation, but in this case, they reported it to the school resource officer, which is the correct procedure.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions don't seem to be in the wrong. They followed the rules by reporting the violation, even if their personal feelings influenced their decision. The consequences were handled by the school, so the author isn't directly responsible for the suspensions or expulsion beyond the initial report. Therefore, the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
