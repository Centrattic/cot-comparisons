So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves them reporting students who were vaping in the restroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The author is conflicted because they feel the school didn't address the root problem by closing the restroom and now they're upset about the consequences for the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legality and school policies. Vaping in school is typically against the rules, so the kids were violating policies. The author reported them, which led to disciplinary actions. Legally, the school can enforce their rules, and students are responsible for following them. The author's action was to report the violation, which is a common way to enforce rules.\n\nBut then there's the ethical angle. The author is upset because the kids are freshmen, young, and maybe didn't realize the consequences. However, the school's responsibility is to maintain order and enforce rules consistently. If the school closed a restroom instead of addressing the behavior, that's a flaw in their approach. But the author's role here is to either comply or report. If they didn't want the kids to get in trouble, they could have approached it differently, like talking to the school first. But instead, they chose to report them directly, which led to the consequences.\n\nAnother point is the author's motivation. They were annoyed because the school's action inconvenienced them. They might have had a personal stake in the situation by reporting the students. However, the school's job is to enforce rules regardless of individual inconveniences. The author's action was to uphold the school's policies, even if the policy was flawed. \n\nThe expelled student had a history of violations, which might mean the school had to take stronger action. The author isn't responsible for the school's previous leniency or the expulsion decision. They just reported the ongoing violation. \n\nIs there a difference between the school's inaction and the author's action? The school could be criticized for not addressing the root cause, but the author's role is to report violations. If they wanted a different approach, they might have needed to discuss it with the administration instead of taking matters into their own hands. But since they reported the incident, they weren't in the wrong in terms of enforcing the existing rules.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author reported a violation of school policy. While the school's initial response was inadequate, the author's action led to consequences the school deemed necessary. The author's responsibility was to follow the rules, and they did by reporting the offense. The ethical dilemma lies in the school's enforcement strategy, not necessarily the author's decision to report.\n"
