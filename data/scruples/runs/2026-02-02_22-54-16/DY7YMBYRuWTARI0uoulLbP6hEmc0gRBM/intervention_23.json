So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let me break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for getting multiple kids suspended and one expelled by reporting vaping in the bathroom. \n\nFirst, the situation: The school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author found another bathroom full of students vaping, didn't confront them but reported it to the school resource officer. As a result, several kids were suspended and one expelled.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the school didn't fix the problem by closing the restroom, so the author took action. They feel bad because the kids are young (14-15). The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but is seeking opinions.\n\nI need to consider legal and ethical angles. Legally, if the school has a policy against vaping, reporting it isn't illegal. The author didn't commit a crime. However, ethically, there's a debate. The author didn't act out of malice but to address a problem they were affected by. The school's response was harsh (expulsion), which might be too severe for first-time offenders, but the author didn't set the punishment. \n\nAnother angle: the author might have acted out of self-interest (not wanting to walk far) but also to tackle the issue. The key is whether the action was justified. Since the students were violating school rules, the author's report is within their right. However, the consequences were severe. But the author isn't responsible for the punishment's severity unless they intentionally targeted the kids. \n\nAlso, the author didn't confront the kids directly, just reported the incident. That's a passive action, not aggressive. The school's resource officer handled the enforcement. So, the author isn't in the wrong for doing what they did. They followed procedures. The real issue might be the school's policy leading to expulsion, but that's not the author's fault. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No). The author isn't in the wrong for reporting the violation, even if the outcome was harsh. They acted within their rights and the school's policy.\n"
