So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the school closing a restroom due to vaping, which the author is upset about because they have to walk far for the bathroom. Later, they see a group of students vaping in another restroom and report them, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and the author's actions. The school had a policy against vaping, so the students were violating that. The author reported the incident, which is generally seen as doing the right thing. However, the author's motivation was partly about their own inconvenience from the restroom closure. That might affect their intent. \n\nBut the main point is whether the author acted wrongly. Reporting illegal or rule-breaking behavior is usually encouraged. The author didn't start a fight or do anything dangerous; they simply informed the resource officer. The fact that some kids were expelled might be due to prior offenses, which the author wasn't aware of. \n\nThe author also mentions they don't have an issue with vaping itself but with the students doing it to impress peers. That could imply they see it as a social problem rather than a moral one. Still, they're reporting a violation. \n\nPossible angles where the author might be in the wrong: maybe they reported out of spite because they were upset about the restroom closure. But the post doesn't say they wanted revenge; it's more about stopping the behavior. Also, the resource officer was already in the hallway, so the author might have just acted on what they saw. \n\nAnother consideration: were there other ways to address the problem? The author could have talked to the school about the restroom issue instead of reporting the students. But the school had already closed the restroom, so maybe there wasn't a solution. \n\nUltimately, the author's action was to stop something they saw as wrong. Unless there's a law against reporting, they're not in the wrong. The consequences (expulsion) are up to the school, not the author. So the answer is B."
