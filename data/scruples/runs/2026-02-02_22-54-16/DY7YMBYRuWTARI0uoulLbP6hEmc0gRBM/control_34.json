So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a high school student who reported vaping in a restroom, leading to multiple suspensions and one expulsion. The writer feels conflicted because the kids are young, but they were upset about the school's previous action of closing a restroom instead of addressing the vaping issue.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from different angles. The main points are: the school had already shut down a restroom due to vaping, the author was inconvenienced, and then they reported another incident where they saw a group of freshmen vaping. The author didn't do anything at the time but later told the resource officer. The result was severe punishments.\n\nNow, considering the rules and responsibilities. The school's policy is against vaping, so students are expected to follow that. If the author is a student, they might have a duty to report violations, but maybe there's a protocol they should follow. However, in schools, sometimes students do report to authorities, even if they didn't directly confront the vapers.\n\nThe author's motivation is a bit of a mix. They were upset because the school didn't fix the problem by just closing the restroom, so they wanted to take action. But then they didn't act immediately when they saw the vaping. Instead, they went to the officer later. Could that matter? Maybe there's a question of whether they acted in good faith or with some vindictiveness. The post mentions they feel bad because the kids are young and naive, but they still went ahead with the report.\n\nAnother angle is the school's responsibility. The school shut down a restroom instead of addressing the root cause, leading to students still vaping in another location. The author's action might have been a way to hold the school's policy accountable by reporting the ongoing violation. But by doing so, they caused suspensions and an expulsion. The question is whether the author overstepped by not following proper channels or if they were just doing their part to enforce school rules.\n\nAlso, the age of the students is a factor. The expelled student had prior incidents, which suggests it's a repeat offender. The others suspended might be first-time offenders. The author might have caused disproportionate consequences if the school didn't consider the context. However, the school's policies are in place for a reason, and the author might not be responsible for the school's enforcement decisions.\n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, the author reported a violation of school rules. That's typically seen as a positive action. But maybe they should have first tried to resolve the issue through other means, like talking to an authority about the restroom closure. However, the post says the author was frustrated with the school's inaction. So maybe the author's action was justified as a response to the school not fixing the problem. But they could argue that the school's punishment was too harsh, especially on freshmen. However, the author's role is to report the violation, not decide the punishment. The school's policy on how to handle violations is their responsibility.\n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong for reporting the violation, especially since the school had already shut down the restroom and the problem persisted. However, there's a nuance in whether the author acted with malice or just in good faith. The post mentions the author felt conflicted because they don't have a problem with vaping per se, but with the students using it to please peers. But the main issue is the violation of school rules, which the author reported. The school's response is their own decision, so the author isn't responsible for that. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
