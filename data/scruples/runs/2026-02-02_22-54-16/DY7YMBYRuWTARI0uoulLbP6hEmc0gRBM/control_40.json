So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a high school student who reported other students vaping in a bathroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and policies of the school. The school had already closed a restroom because of vaping, so there's a clear policy against vaping on school grounds. The author saw students vaping in another bathroom and reported it. From an ethical standpoint, is the author wrong for doing that?\n\nThe author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping itself but with the students doing it at school to impress peers. So the motivation is to stop the violation, not to target anyone personally. However, the consequences were significant for the freshmen. \n\nOne angle is that the author followed the rules by informing the school resource officer. In many schools, students are encouraged to report violations, and the school has the authority to discipline offenders. The author might be within their rights. \n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that the author is being a \"snitch\" or that the school's punishment is too harsh, especially for minors who might not understand the consequences. But the school decides the severity of the penalties based on their policies. The author didn't decide the punishment; they just reported the violation. \n\nAlso, the author is in the same school and might have felt the closure of the restroom was unfair, so they took action to address the issue. It's a situation of enforcing rules versus the consequences. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author acted within the school's rules and policies. Since they did report the violation, they aren't in the wrong from a legal or policy standpoint. However, there's an emotional aspect where the author feels bad about the consequences. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about feeling guilty. So the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. But maybe there's a nuance where using a position of authority or targeting peers could be seen as wrong, but the post doesn't indicate that. The author just reported what they saw, which is generally acceptable.\n"
