So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the writer reporting a group of students vaping in a bathroom, leading to suspensions and one expulsion. The author feels bad because the students are young.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the school. The school closed a restroom because students were vaping there, but now the students are using another restroom. The writer reports this, which leads to consequences. The school's policy is against vaping, so the students are violating the rules. By reporting them, the writer is following the school's rules, right?\n\nBut the writer is upset about the outcome. They mention they don't have an issue with vaping itself but with the students doing it against the school's rules. The writer's action led to disciplinary measures, including expelling a student who had prior violations. The question is whether the writer is in the wrong for doing this.\n\nOn one hand, the writer is reporting a violation, which seems responsible. They might think the school isn't enforcing the rules properly, so they take initiative. On the other hand, the writer might have acted out of spite because they were annoyed by the restroom closure. Also, they didn't confront the students directly but went straight to the resource officer, which could be seen as snitching.\n\nBut the school policy is clear: vaping is prohibited. The writer didn't do anything illegal. The problem is whether they overstepped. Since the students were violating a school rule, the writer isn't in the wrong for reporting it. However, some might argue that targeting freshmen who are still young and making mistakes could be harsh. But the school's responsibility is to enforce rules, and the writer is just a student following through. The writer's intent was to address the issue they found unfair, which is closing a restroom without fixing the problem. So, maybe they are in the right.\n\nBut maybe there's another angle. Did the writer have the right to involve the resource officer without the students knowing? If the writer had tried to talk to them first, that might be different. But the situation is a school setting, and resource officers are there to handle such issues. So, the writer's action is within the school's procedures. Therefore, the answer would be B, the writer is not in the wrong.\n"
