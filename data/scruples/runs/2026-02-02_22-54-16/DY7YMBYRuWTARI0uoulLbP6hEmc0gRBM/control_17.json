So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation where they got several students suspended and one expelled for vaping in a closed restroom. \n\nFirst, the school closed a restroom because students were vaping there, mostly freshmen. The author was annoyed because they had to walk farther for the bathroom. Then, they saw a group in the open restroom, didn't confront them directly, but went to the resource officer and reported the activity, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nSo, the main points here: The author didn't directly confront the students but reported them. The school's policy was to close the restroom instead of taking strict action, but when the problem moved to the open restroom, the author took it upon themselves to report. The question is about whether the author did something wrong.\n\nThe author mentions they don't have an issue with vaping itself, but they're upset because the kids are doing it to fit in. The author's motivation seems to be frustration with the school's inaction and the inconvenience caused by moving the restroom. But the result was suspensions and expulsion of freshmen, which the author now feels bad about.\n\nEthically, there's a debate here. On one hand, the author is reporting a policy violation, which is their right. Schools have rules against vaping, and the officer is there to enforce them. The author might be seen as fulfilling their responsibility by bringing the issue to the school's attention.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's personal motive is to address the inconvenience they face. They might be using the school's rules more harshly than intended, especially if the school's approach was to avoid severe punishments in the past. Also, the fact that the students are still breaking the rules in a different restroom suggests the problem isn't really fixed, just shifted. The author's action led to harsh consequences, which could be seen as excessive, especially if they didn't try to warn the students first. The fact that the author didn't directly confront them but immediately reported might imply they wanted to get others in trouble rather than help resolve the issue.\n\nThe school's policy might have a process for reporting such issues, but maybe the author didn't follow the right steps. If they had first tried to talk to the students or a teacher, maybe the outcome would have been different. However, the officer is the appropriate authority to handle such reports. \n\nBut the key point is the author's intent. If their main goal was to get the kids in trouble because they were annoyed, that could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if they were genuinely trying to enforce the rules despite personal inconvenience, that's more about responsibility. The problem is that the school's initial response was to close a restroom instead of punishing, which might have been ineffective. The author's action might not be wrong if they followed the proper channels, but the outcome's harshness and the age of the students could make people question if the consequences were too severe.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on the action's justification and potential overstepping. The author's action led to expulsions, which is significant. The question is whether the author overreacted or used the system in a way that wasn't fair. The answer depends on the balance between enforcing rules and the personal motive of convenience. Also, the fact that the kids are young and might not realize the consequences could tip the scales towards the author being in the wrong because they might have contributed to a harsh outcome without a noble cause. Alternatively, the author is just following the rules as they are applied. But since the school's initial approach was lax, and the author's action was more about personal annoyance, maybe the author is in the wrong.\n"
