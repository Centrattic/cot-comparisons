So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the school closed a restroom because students were vaping there, but now the writer found another group vaping in the other restroom and reported them. This led to several suspensions and one expulsion. The writer feels bad because they're all freshmen (14-15 years old) and might not realize the consequences yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the school. If vaping is against school policy, then the students who are doing it are in violation. The writer reported the incident, which led to disciplinary actions. So, from a rule enforcement standpoint, the writer is following the rules by reporting the violation. However, the writer might feel conflicted because they might see the school's initial response (closing a restroom) as not addressing the root problem, leading to more incidents.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer is a student who is taking it upon themselves to enforce rules. There's a question of whether they overstepped by actively informing the school resource officer and causing suspensions/expulsions. The writer's motivation is mentioned as frustration with the school's handling of the issue, but they also clarify they don't have a problem with vaping itself, just that the students are doing it to impress peers.\n\nEthically, is it right for a student to report peers in this way? It could be seen as doing the right thing by upholding rules, but some might argue it's tattling, especially if the writer was just walking in and out of the restroom and saw the vaping. However, the writer didn't participate or encourage the behavior, just reported what they saw.\n\nThe school's initial response was problematic (closing a restroom instead of addressing the behavior), which might have contributed to the situation. The writer's action could be seen as trying to fix the problem they see as not being handled properly. But the consequences are severe for the freshmen, which makes them feel bad.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the school is responsible for enforcing rules and creating a safe environment. If the school failed to monitor the bathroom after closing the other one, they might share some blame. The writer is a student, so their role is different from staff. However, students can report violations they witness.\n\nSo, considering all that, the writer isn't in the wrong for reporting the violation. They were following the rules, even if the school's initial action was flawed. However, the writer's frustration is understandable, and maybe the school should have handled the initial problem better. But as for the act of reporting, it's within the student's right to do so. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
