So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about them getting several kids suspended and one expelled after reporting vaping in a bathroom.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The school closed a restroom because kids were vaping there. The author was frustrated because they had to walk farther to use the bathroom. Then they saw kids vaping in the other bathroom and reported it, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The author feels bad because the kids are freshmen, around 14-15, and maybe didn't realize the consequences.\n\nNow, considering the rules of the school. If the policy is against vaping, then the kids were violating it. The author reported the violation, which is their right. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the author is following the rules and ensuring others do too. They might have a duty to report illegal or school-prohibited activities. On the other hand, the author might have overstepped by not trying to address the issue through proper channels first. Instead of reporting directly to the resource officer, maybe they could have talked to a teacher or administrator. Also, the author didn't confront the kids themselves, just reported them, which could be seen as snitching. \n\nBut the school's responsibility is to maintain a safe environment. Vaping is a health issue and against school policies. The author's action might be justified as they're helping enforce rules. However, the consequences were severe (expulsion for one), which might lead the author to feel guilty, especially considering the age of the kids. \n\nIs the author at fault? It depends on the school's policies and how the reporting process works. If the correct procedure was followed, maybe not. But if they bypassed the proper steps, that could be an issue. The user didn't mention if the author reported through the right channels, but they went directly to the resource officer, which might be appropriate. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often feel conflicted. The author's intention was to stop the wrongdoing, but the outcome was harsh. The question is whether the action was wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author reported a policy violation, which is their responsibility. However, some might argue that they should have handled it differently, like talking to the kids first. \n\nBut in school settings, students are encouraged to report such activities. So the author isn't wrong for reporting. The severity of the punishment is up to the school's discretion. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
