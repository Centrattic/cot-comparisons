So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a student who reported others for vaping in the school restroom, leading to multiple suspensions and an expulsion. The key points here are the student's intentions, the school's actions, and the consequences.\n\nFirst, the student was upset about the school closing a restroom instead of addressing the vaping issue. They then saw a group of freshmen vaping in the other restroom and reported them. The user argues that the author isn't in the wrong, but others might see it differently.\n\nThe main ethical question is about the student's right to report the incident. Legally, reporting illegal or rule-breaking activities is generally acceptable. However, the moral aspect involves whether the student acted with malicious intent. The author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping itself but with the students doing it to impress peers. \n\nThe consequences are significant for the freshmen, including an expulsion. The author feels bad because the kids are young and might not understand the repercussions. So, the question is whether the student overstepped by involving the resource officer, leading to harsh penalties.\n\nSome might argue that the student's action was justified to stop the school from being a place for underage vaping, especially since the school had already failed to address the issue. Others might say the student took it too far, using the situation to get revenge for the inconvenience of the closed restroom, potentially harming the students' futures.\n\nThe school's response (suspensions/expulsion) is another angle. If the school's policies are strict and the student followed proper channels, the author isn't necessarily at fault. But if the punishment was disproportionate, the author might be seen as contributing to an unjust outcome.\n\nIn summary, the answer depends on whether the student's intent was to uphold school rules or to retaliate. Since the author's motivation was to address a problem they found frustrating, and they reported the incident to an authority, it's more about the school's response rather than the student's action. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong."
