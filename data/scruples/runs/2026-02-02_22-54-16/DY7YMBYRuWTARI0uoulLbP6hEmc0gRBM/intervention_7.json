So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a high school student who reported a group of kids vaping in the restroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the school. The school closed a bathroom because students were vaping there, which is against school policy. The author found others vaping in the remaining bathroom and reported them. The school's action was to shut down the first bathroom, but the problem persisted. The author's intent was to address the issue by reporting the students.\n\nThe user says they don't have a problem with vaping itself but with the students doing it in school. The author's motivation was to stop the behavior, not to target the kids. However, the consequences were severe for some, especially the expelled student who had a history. The author feels bad because the kids are young and maybe didn't realize the consequences.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the students were indeed violating school rules, the author might have done the right thing by reporting them. The school's policy is in place for a reason, and students are expected to follow it. However, the author could be seen as snitching, which is a common criticism in schools. But if the policy is enforced, then reporting violations is part of that enforcement.\n\nThe author didn't confront the students or escalate the situation beyond reporting. The school then took disciplinary actions. Since the author was following the school's rules, maybe they're not in the wrong. On the flip side, if the school's approach was lenient in the past but then strict this time, maybe the author's report led to disproportionate punishment. However, the expelled student had a history, so that might justify the action.\n\nIn terms of legal or ethical standpoint, the author is reporting a violation, which is generally encouraged. But the social context might see it as snitching. However, in a school setting, following rules is expected. The author's main issue is the inconvenience of the bathroom closure, but they still chose to report the ongoing violations. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author is likely not in the wrong. They reported a policy violation, which the school is responsible for handling. The consequences were the school's decision, not the author's. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
