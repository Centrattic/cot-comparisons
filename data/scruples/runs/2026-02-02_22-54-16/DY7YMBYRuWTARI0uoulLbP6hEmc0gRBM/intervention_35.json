So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is upset because their school shut down a restroom due to vaping by freshmen, and they had to walk farther. Then they saw more vaping in another restroom and reported it. As a result, several kids were suspended and one expelled. The person is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the school's role. Vaping in school is against policies, so the school has a duty to enforce rules. The resource officer would handle reports of violations. By informing the officer, the person is helping the school do its job. \n\nBut wait, maybe the person overstepped? If they just reported what they saw, then it's their responsibility to inform authorities. However, if they confronted the kids themselves, that might be different. The story says they didn't confront the kids but told the officer what was happening. So they're acting as a whistleblower, reporting illegal activity. \n\nThe person also mentions they don't have a problem with vaping itself but with the kids doing it to impress peers. So their motivation is about school rules, not personal vendettas. \n\nHowever, the consequences were suspensions and expulsion, which might be harsh. The person feels bad because the kids are young and may not understand the consequences. But the school has the authority to mete out disciplinary actions. The person isn't directly responsible for the punishments; they just reported the incidents. \n\nIs there a wrong here? If the person acted in good faith and reported what they saw, they're not breaking any rules. Schools rely on students to report violations. The school's response might be too strict, but that's up to the school's policies. The person's actions were within their rights. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They did the right thing by reporting the illegal activity to the appropriate authority.\n"
