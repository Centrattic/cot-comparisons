So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a high school student who reported a group of kids vaping in a restroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The key points to consider are the school's actions, the student's motivation, and the consequences.\n\nFirst, the school shut down a restroom instead of addressing the root issue of vaping. The author was frustrated because this made their daily routine harder. Then, when seeing more vaping in another restroom, they reported it, resulting in serious consequences for the students involved, mostly freshmen. The author feels bad because the kids are young and might not understand the repercussions.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, if the students were indeed vaping in a school setting, the school has rules against that, so the author might be following the rules by reporting. However, ethically, the author might be seen as going beyond just reporting\u2014maybe using the situation for personal gain (avoiding the inconvenient restroom) rather than a genuine concern for school policy. But the author claims they don't have a problem with vaping itself, but with others violating school rules. \n\nThe school's response was harsh, expelling a student, which could be seen as disproportionate. However, the author's role is as a student who reported the incident. They might not be responsible for the school's disciplinary actions, but their intent matters. If they reported to uphold rules, they might be in the right. If they did it out of spite or to make their own life easier, it's more questionable.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and proportionality. Here, the author's action led to severe consequences. While the school's policies are in place, the author's motivation might be seen as self-serving. However, they might not be in the wrong if they genuinely believed the reporting was necessary. Different perspectives here: some might say the author overstepped, others might think they did the right thing by enforcing rules. But considering the emotional aspect and the age of the students involved, there's a case for the author being in the right as well.\n"
