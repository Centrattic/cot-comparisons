Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author mentions that their girlfriend believes in pseudoscience like vaccinations causing autism and homeopathy. The author is against this and can't support her going into a field they view as promoting such beliefs. They also bring up the financial aspect of her ND school, which is a significant debt. They feel bad about breaking up over this but can't see past their differences in values regarding medicine.\n\nFirst, I should consider the reasons for the breakup. The author is concerned about the girlfriend's career choice, which they see as harmful. They mention the risk of someone dying because they rely on ND instead of MD. This is a serious issue, especially if the ND is treating patients with severe conditions like cancer. The author might be worried about her future patients' safety if she's promoting ineffective treatments.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is pursuing her career, which is a personal choice. The author is using this as a reason to break up, which could be seen as overstepping if they didn't address the issue earlier or if there were other underlying problems. The financial burden is another factor, but relationships often involve supporting each other through financial challenges. However, the author might be justified in not wanting to take on that debt if they disagree with the field.\n\nLove and compatibility are key in relationships. If their core values about medicine, which is a significant part of her career, are irreconcilable, then the breakup might be the result of incompatible long-term goals. The author believes that love should be about caring, but when values conflict, it can create a fundamental problem. The author is in a difficult position because they care deeply but can't compromise on what they see as a matter of life and death.\n\nHowever, is it right to end a 10-year relationship over this? The author feels guilty and scattered, indicating emotional turmoil. The question is whether the issue is about the career choice itself or the pseudoscience involved. If the girlfriend's actions could potentially harm others, the author's concern is valid. But if she's just promoting alternative medicine as a supplement, maybe the author is overreacting.\n\nI need to weigh the ethical aspect of the author ending the relationship versus the girlfriend's right to her career. The author might not be in the wrong if they can't support her in a field they view as harmful. However, relationships require compromise, and maybe the author should have tried to work through this issue rather than breaking up. But if the conflict is too deep, it's understandable. The answer depends on whether the author's reasons are justified and if they've given it enough thought before deciding to end the relationship.\n"
