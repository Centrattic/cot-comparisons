Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her becoming a Naturopathic Doctor is in the wrong. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The guy broke up because he disagrees with her belief in pseudoscience, like homeopathy and the idea that vaccines cause autism. He's worried about her giving up modern medicine. He also mentions financial issues, like her 200k debt for school, which he'd have to support. He feels bad because he thinks love shouldn't be about money or views, but his future vision conflicts with hers.\n\nOn the other side, his girlfriend is set on becoming an ND, which he sees as problematic. He argues that NDs have a place as an alternative but can't replace modern medicine. He's concerned about patients relying on NDs for serious issues instead of MDs. The breakup was over money and differing beliefs about medicine.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, compatibility is key. If core values like career choice and scientific beliefs are clashing, that's a big issue. But is it fair to break up over that? Some might say that if you can't respect each other's choices, then the relationship isn't sustainable. Others might say that love should overcome such differences.\n\nThe financial aspect is another point. Taking on significant debt is a major commitment. If he's not willing to support her financially, that's a practical concern. But if he's breaking up primarily because of her career choice and beliefs, that might be more about values.\n\nHowever, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he can't support her in her career due to his beliefs, maybe he's not the right partner. But if he's making a decision based on genuine concerns about pseudoscience affecting patient health, is that valid? It's a tough balance between respecting her choices and his own ethical stance.\n\nIn relationships, when fundamental values conflict, it can lead to irreconcilable differences. Since he's not able to reconcile his beliefs with hers, the breakup might be seen as a result of incompatible core values rather than being wrong. But he might still feel guilty because he values love over material concerns, yet his actions were based on those material issues.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether choosing a career that one partner fundamentally disagrees with is a valid reason to end a relationship. If both can't find common ground, then it's a matter of personal priorities. In this case, the author might not be in the wrong if they couldn't find a way to compromise, but some might argue that love requires more tolerance.\n"
