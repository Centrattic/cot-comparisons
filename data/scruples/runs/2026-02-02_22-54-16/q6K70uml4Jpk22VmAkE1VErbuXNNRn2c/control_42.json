Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) with certain beliefs.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author broke up with his girlfriend over her career choice in ND, which he associates with pseudoscience like homeopathy and vaccines causing autism. He's upset because their future visions differ, especially regarding science and medicine. He also mentions financial concerns about her $200k debt for school. He feels guilty but can't reconcile their differing views.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. In a relationship, differences in core values can be a valid reason to break up. If one partner's career is based on practices the other considers harmful or pseudoscientific, that's a significant issue. The author is concerned that her work might lead to people not getting proper medical care, which could be dangerous. However, love and respect are supposed to overcome such issues if both are willing to compromise. But here, the author feels he can't support something he sees as potentially harmful. On the other hand, maybe he could have tried to find common ground or support her choice despite his beliefs. But given that it's about medical practices affecting others, it's a complex ethical issue. The financial aspect adds another layer, especially if he felt he couldn't support her financially. However, using money as the main reason when the underlying issue is about values might complicate things. Ultimately, it's about whether his reasons are justified. If he can't support her career due to ethical concerns about her work's impact, maybe it's a valid reason. But if the break-up was more about control or not understanding her perspective, he might be in the wrong. The key points are the validity of his concerns about pseudoscience and whether the breakup was necessary. The answer might depend on whether the relationship could have endured those differences. Since the user is asking for a judgment, I have to decide based on typical views on such matters. In many cases, people think that relationships should tolerate differences unless they're harmful. But here, the harm could be to others through her future work. However, the author might not have realized that NDs can coexist with MDs. But given his strong opposition, maybe he's justified. Alternatively, maybe he's wrong to prioritize his beliefs over love. Hmm, tricky. I need to weigh ethical concerns versus relationship commitment. I think in this case, the author might not be entirely wrong because he's standing by his belief that pseudoscience is harmful, but he's also causing personal loss. However, the question is if he's in the wrong. Maybe the answer is B, No, because he's acting on his core beliefs about science and ethics. But others might say he's wrong to let that interfere with love. I'm a bit torn. But considering that relationships require mutual respect and understanding, if he can't respect her career path, then it's a valid reason. So maybe B, No.\n"
