Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend over her decision to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and her beliefs in pseudoscience like homeopathy and the idea that vaccines cause autism.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author is upset because his girlfriend is going into a field he views as promoting pseudoscience. He's against practices that are disproven by science and is concerned about the financial burden of her education. He feels like he's made a mistake by ending the relationship over these issues, but he's conflicted because he loves her a lot.\n\nNow, let's break down the situation. The main issues are differing values regarding science and medicine, financial responsibility, and whether these are valid reasons to end a relationship. The girlfriend is committed to a career path that the author disagrees with strongly. He's not against all alternative medicine but draws the line at practices he sees as harmful or ineffective. He's also worried about the debt and the potential consequences of her work, like patients not receiving proper medical care.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's standing by his beliefs and values. He thinks that relying on pseudoscience is dangerous, especially in treating serious conditions like cancer. His concern about the financial aspect is also a practical consideration. However, he's feeling guilty because he thinks love shouldn't be about money or life views, but his own values are clashing with hers.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's choice to pursue ND might be a core part of her identity and beliefs. If she's passionate about this path and sees it as her calling, the author's opposition could be seen as dismissing her aspirations. Relationships often require compromise, but there's a limit when it comes to deeply held personal values or ethical concerns.\n\nThe question is whether it's reasonable to end a relationship over fundamental disagreements like this. While love and care are important, compatibility in values and life goals is also crucial for long-term happiness. The author's concerns about pseudoscience leading to harm might be valid from a scientific standpoint, but it's a heavy issue to base a breakup on, especially if the relationship was otherwise strong.\n\nFinancial considerations are also a common reason for breakups, but in this case, they're tied to the career choice, which adds another layer. The author's family and friends think it shouldn't matter, but he disagrees, which complicates things.\n\nI need to consider if the author acted unreasonably. Breaking up because of core value differences isn't inherently wrong, but the way he approached it\u2014focusing on money and science\u2014could be seen as prioritizing his own values over her happiness. However, if he genuinely believes her work could be harmful, he's protecting his values, which is a tough spot.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person's actions were justified given the circumstances. If the author's decision was based on a legitimate concern for safety and ethics, he might be seen as not in the wrong. But if the breakup was a reaction to differing beliefs without sufficient discussion or compromise, he could be viewed as the asshole.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the analysis. The key factors are the impact on patients, the validity of his concerns, and whether there was mutual respect and understanding in the relationship. If the author felt that the differences were insurmountable and a deal-breaker, he's not necessarily in the wrong. But if he dismissed her without considering her perspective, it could be a problem.\n"
