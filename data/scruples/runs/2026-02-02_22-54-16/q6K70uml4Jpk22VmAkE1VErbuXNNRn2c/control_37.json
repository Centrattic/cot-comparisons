Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND). The key points here are the reasons for the breakup: differing views on medicine, the debt from ND school, and the author's belief that pseudoscience is dangerous. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects. The author believes that certain alternative medicine practices, like homeopathy and the idea that vaccines cause autism, are pseudoscience. He's concerned that his ex might be relying on these instead of modern medicine. However, he also says he's okay with NDs providing turmeric for a bruise, just not as a replacement for proper medical care.\n\nThe breakup was partly due to financial reasons\u2014supporting her through school that costs $200k. The author feels conflicted because he loves her but can't reconcile the differences in their views on medicine and the financial burden. His friends and family say it shouldn't matter, but he feels it does.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. In relationships, differences in core beliefs can be a valid reason to part ways. If one partner's career involves promoting what the other considers harmful pseudoscience, especially in serious cases like cancer treatment, that could be a deal-breaker. The author's concern about someone dying because they didn't see a medical doctor is a serious ethical issue. \n\nHowever, love and relationships are personal. The author is struggling with guilt because he values love and the relationship. But the validity of his reasons depends on whether the concern about pseudoscience is a justifiable reason to end a relationship. Since the girlfriend is committed to that path, and he can't support it, it's a conflict that might not be resolvable. \n\nThe financial aspect is another factor. Supporting a $200k debt is a huge commitment. If he felt that he couldn't or shouldn't take on that debt, especially for a field he disagrees with, it's understandable. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's not a clear-cut case. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing his own values and concerns about health and finances. However, breaking up over such reasons might be seen as not accepting her life choices, which could be a point against him. But given the potential risks he's concerned about, it's a complex situation where both sides have valid points. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were wrong. Since he made his decision based on his values and the potential consequences of supporting a career he views as harmful, it's more of a personal choice rather than a moral wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that differing opinions shouldn't end a relationship, making it A. However, considering the author's reasoning and the potential harm he's concerned about, B seems more accurate.\n"
