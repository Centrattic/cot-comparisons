Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given text is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and holds beliefs like vaccines causing autism and homeopathy, which are considered pseudoscientific. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the situation. The author is upset because he ended a 10-year relationship over this issue. He feels conflicted because he loves her but can't accept her career choice and beliefs. His main concerns are her belief in pseudoscience and the financial burden of her ND school. \n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Relationships often involve compromise, but there are also deal-breakers. The author's reasoning is based on the woman's career path and beliefs. He's worried about her professional views conflicting with his own, especially regarding medical practices. He also mentions the financial aspect, which he would have to support her through the $200k debt.\n\nOn one hand, people should be free to choose their careers and beliefs. However, if those beliefs involve promoting pseudoscience in a field where it could harm others (like cancer patients), that's a serious issue. The author is concerned about potential harm, which is a valid concern. But is it fair to break up over it? \n\nThe question is whether the author acted wrongfully. If the girlfriend is using pseudoscience in a medical context, that's a problem. But the author is not in the wrong for prioritizing his values and the potential risks he can't accept. However, the way he ended the relationship might be seen as harsh if he's not considering her perspective or if the decision was based on fear rather than open communication. \n\nFinancial support is another angle. If he felt he couldn't take on her debt, that's a personal choice, but using money as the main reason might not be the healthiest reason for a breakup. However, the core issue is the fundamental disagreement about her career and its implications. \n\nIn some views, ending a relationship over differing beliefs can be wrong if the beliefs don't directly affect each other's safety or well-being. But in this case, the beliefs involve medical practices that could be harmful. The author is not in the wrong if he can't reconcile the potential risks to others from her career. \n\nBut also, love and relationships should ideally overcome such differences with mutual respect. If the author couldn't find a middle ground, maybe the breakup is a result of incompatible values. So, it's a tough call. However, the author is not in the wrong because he's standing up for his values regarding evidence-based medicine. The answer would be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
