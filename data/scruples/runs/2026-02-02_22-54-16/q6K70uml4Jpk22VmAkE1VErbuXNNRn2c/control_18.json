Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author broke up with their girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), and they disagree with her beliefs, like vaccinations causing autism and homeopathy. The author feels bad because they think love shouldn't be about money or views on life, but their future visions clash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issues are the pseudoscientific beliefs and the financial burden of her ND school. They can't support someone who they think is promoting harmful practices, especially if it could lead to patients not getting proper medical care. On the other hand, the girlfriend is passionate about her career choice, and the author is ending the relationship over those differences.\n\nIn relationships, it's common for differing values to cause issues. But is the author right to break up over this? Well, if the author truly can't accept her career and beliefs, maybe they are incompatible. However, is it fair to end a 10-year relationship over this? The author mentions that love should be about caring and love, not material things, but then they ended it because of money and views. That seems contradictory. \n\nAlso, the author brings up the financial aspect, saying they couldn't support her through $200k debt. That's a valid concern, but is it the right reason to break up? Maybe they should have discussed it earlier. However, if the author's core values (like rejecting pseudoscience) are being compromised, that's a big deal. The girlfriend's beliefs could lead to harmful practices, which the author can't condone. \n\nBut is it the author's place to judge her career choice? They might have a right to their own beliefs, but forcing a partner to abandon their career path is a heavy decision. The author feels guilty, which suggests they're conflicted. The key here is whether the author's reasons are justified. If they believe that supporting her ND career would mean endorsing pseudoscience that could harm others, maybe they feel it's necessary. But relationships require compromise. If both can't find a middle ground, maybe the breakup is their way of staying true to themselves. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. The author isn't necessarily wrong if they feel they can't live with these differences. However, some might argue that love should overcome such disagreements. But others might say that core values like scientific integrity are too important to compromise on. The answer likely depends on the depth of their beliefs and whether they tried to reconcile their differences before breaking up. The author did mention they talked to friends and family, who said it shouldn't matter, but they still felt it did. So maybe they followed their conscience, which makes them not entirely in the wrong. \n\nBut the fact that they ended it over money and beliefs, which they admit shouldn't matter, makes them question their decision. However, if they truly can't support her career due to ethical concerns, maybe they aren't in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), because the author is acting based on their values, even if it's painful.\n"
