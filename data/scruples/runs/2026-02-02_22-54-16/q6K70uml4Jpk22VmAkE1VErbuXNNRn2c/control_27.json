Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they broke up with their girlfriend because she wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), and he has issues with the pseudoscientific aspects of that field. He loves her a lot, but their future visions are conflicting. He's feeling bad about it because he thinks love shouldn't be about money and life views, but he can't support her career choice due to the debt and his beliefs about alternative medicine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether ending the relationship over this is justified. The author is concerned about the financial burden of her ND school, which is around $200k. He would have to support her through it, which is a big commitment. Money is a common reason for breakups, and it's a practical concern. But then there's the issue of her beliefs, like vaccinations causing autism and homeopathy, which are scientifically disproven. The author values evidence-based medicine and can't condone moving away from modern practices, especially if it might harm patients. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is passionate about her career and her approach to medicine. The author acknowledges that NDs have a place as an alternative but can't support a complete shift away from modern medicine. This difference in core beliefs about healthcare could be a significant issue, especially if they disagreed on how to handle serious illnesses or whether to rely on alternative treatments over proven medical protocols. \n\nThe emotional aspect is that the author feels he's being a \"total ass hat\" because he loves her a lot. However, relationships often require compromise. If their fundamental values on an important topic like healthcare are irreconcilable, it might be a deal-breaker. The author also mentions that this is after a 10-year relationship, so it's possible they've tried to work through this issue before without resolution. \n\nIs it fair to end the relationship over such a conflict? If they couldn't agree on a future where he supports her career despite his beliefs, then maybe the breakup is a result of their incompatibility rather than one person being in the wrong. The author is prioritizing his values and practical considerations, while the girlfriend is doing the same. The question is whether his reasons are valid enough to end the relationship. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. However, ending a long-term relationship over deep-seated disagreements about career and values isn't necessarily being in the wrong. The author is making a choice that aligns with his beliefs and financial reality, even though it's painful. The girlfriend might feel wronged, but the author's perspective is that he can't support a path he deems harmful or unethical. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the decision stems from his core beliefs and practical concerns, and relationships often end when there's irreconcilable differences.\n"
