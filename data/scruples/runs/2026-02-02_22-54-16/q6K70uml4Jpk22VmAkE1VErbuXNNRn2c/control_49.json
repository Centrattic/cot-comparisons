Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and believes in certain alternative medicine practices that he disagrees with.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is upset because he values modern medicine and is concerned about pseudoscience, like homeopathy and the idea that vaccines cause autism, which are debunked. He's worried that her career choice might lead to harmful outcomes if she recommends unproven treatments instead of evidence-based medicine. Also, he mentions the financial burden of her ND school, which he would have to support. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is passionate about alternative medicine, which she sees as complementary or a different approach. The author feels that love shouldn't be about money or life views, but in this case, their visions for the future clash. He broke up with her over these differences, and now he's feeling guilty because he loves her deeply but can't reconcile their disagreements.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, differences in core values can be a significant issue. The author believes that trusting pseudoscience is dangerous, especially in a medical field. If someone is treating patients, especially critical ones like cancer patients, relying on unproven methods could be harmful. The financial aspect adds another layer, as he's not willing to take on a large debt for her education.\n\nBut, love and relationships are also about mutual respect and acceptance. The author is struggling because he loves her but can't support her path. However, breaking up over this might be justified if the differences are irreconcilable and involve potential harm. On the other hand, maybe there was a lack of communication or compromise. Did they try to find a middle ground? The author's main points are about the money and the medical beliefs. \n\nLegally or ethically, the author isn't wrong for ending a relationship, but morally, it's a gray area. If the girlfriend's career could lead to actual harm (like advising against proven treatments), then the author's concerns are valid. However, love relationships are personal, and what matters is how both individuals feel. Since the author feels torn but can't reconcile the differences, perhaps he isn't in the wrong. \n\nAnother angle: the financial burden. If he's not willing to support her through her education, that's a valid reason. But if it's more about her career choice regardless of money, then it's about conflicting values. The key is whether the author's decision was based on valid concerns or prejudice. If he truly believes that her work is harmful, that's a strong ethical stance. But if he's dismissing her career choice without understanding her perspective, maybe that's where the issue lies.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a tough call. The author is justified in his concerns about pseudoscience and potential harm, especially in a medical context. However, breaking up over this might be seen as prioritizing his beliefs over love. But since relationships require mutual compatibility, if these differences are fundamental, maybe he's not in the wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because his reasons are based on valid concerns about safety and values.\n"
