Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend because she wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), and he's conflicted about it. He mentions her beliefs in pseudoscience like vaccinations causing autism and homeopathy, which he disagrees with. He also brings up financial concerns about her ND school debt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author believes that love shouldn't be about money or life views, but he ended the relationship over those exact issues. The girlfriend is committed to a field he views as based on pseudoscience, which worries him because he thinks she might not support modern medical practices, possibly leading to harm if patients rely on her advice instead of MDs.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, breaking up over differing life goals or values can be valid if those differences are deal-breakers. If he can't accept her career choice and its implications (like financial burden and her beliefs), maybe he's justified. On the other hand, love is supposed to accept each other's differences. But how big of a difference is this? Naturopathic medicine is controversial and sometimes considered pseudoscientific, especially with her views on vaccines and homeopathy. That could be a serious issue if her future work conflicts with his values.\n\nHe also mentions the financial aspect. Supporting her through $200k in debt might be a significant burden. But is that a reason to break up? It's material, and he says he tried to tell himself it shouldn't matter, but it does. However, it's part of their future plans, which is a legitimate concern in a relationship. \n\nBut the main conflict seems to be her beliefs versus his. If she is going into a field that he views as harmful or unscientific, and he can't reconcile that, maybe it's a fundamental difference in values. Yet, is it fair to end a 10-year relationship over that? Did he try to communicate and find a middle ground? The argument ended with him focusing on money, but the root issue might be her career choice and beliefs. \n\nThere's also the aspect of trust and respect. If he can't respect her career or her views, even if he disagrees, that might erode the relationship. However, if her career is based on beliefs that could lead to unethical practices (like dismissing vaccines), that's a red flag. But is breaking up the right response? Maybe they should have discussed it more before making such a decision. \n\nThe author feels guilty because he thinks love shouldn't be about material things. But if the career choice and beliefs are non-negotiable for him, then maybe he isn't in the wrong. It's complicated. The girlfriend's sister is an ND, so maybe there's a family influence. The author is worried about patient outcomes if she practices in a way that's not evidence-based. That's a valid concern, but is it his place to dictate her career choices? \n\nIn relationships, major disagreements can lead to breakups. If they couldn't find a way to support each other despite their differences, perhaps he's not wrong. But the way he framed the breakup, focusing on money instead of her beliefs, might be avoiding the real issue. The pseudoscience part is a deal-breaker for him, even if he's trying to justify it with financial reasons. \n\nI think the key is whether his reasons are valid. If he can't support her career choice because of ethical concerns, that's a big issue. However, if he's being overly rigid and not considering that she might integrate both approaches, then maybe he's in the wrong. The post doesn't mention if she was open to using modern medicine alongside ND practices. If she's set on pseudoscience and dismissing proven methods, that's a problem. \n\nGiven that the author is clear about his stance on modern medicine and can't condone giving it up, his decision might be based on genuine incompatibility in core values. Even though it's material, the debt is a practical aspect of supporting her career. But if the breakup was solely because of her beliefs and not the financials, then he might be in the wrong for letting that overshadow love. However, the post states that the financial argument was the immediate cause, but the underlying issue is her career path. \n\nSo, in the end, it's a tough call. But if the breakup was due to non-negotiable differences in values (her belief in pseudoscience vs. his reliance on modern medicine), then he might have a point. However, the way he handled it by focusing on money instead of her career beliefs could be seen as avoiding the real issue, hence making him in the wrong. But if his primary concern is her future work's impact on patients, that's a valid ethical concern. \n\nI'm leaning towards B (No), because if their core values are fundamentally incompatible, especially regarding something as important as medical practices that can affect others' health, then it's a significant issue. But the guilt he feels suggests he's conflicted. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he can't support her in a way that respects her career without compromising his beliefs, maybe it's not his fault. Alternatively, if he could have found a way to support her despite the disagreements, then he might be in the wrong. The post says he tried to tell himself it shouldn't matter but it does, indicating it's a real conflict. So, the answer might be B.\n"
