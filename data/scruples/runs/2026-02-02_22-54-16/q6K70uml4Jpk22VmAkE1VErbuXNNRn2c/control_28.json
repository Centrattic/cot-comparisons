Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author mentions that he broke up with his girlfriend because she's determined to attend ND school, where he thinks the teachings include pseudoscience like homeopathy and the idea that vaccines cause autism. He believes in modern medicine and is worried about her using methods that could be harmful, especially if patients don't seek proper medical care. Also, he's concerned about the financial burden of her 200k debt and supporting her through school. His friends and family told him it shouldn't matter, but he feels conflicted.\n\nFirst, I should consider the reasons behind the breakup. Is it fair to end a relationship over career choices, especially when it's about beliefs in alternative medicine? The girlfriend is passionate about her field, and the author's main issue is her reliance on what he sees as pseudoscience. However, he acknowledges that NDs have a place as an alternative to modern medicine, as long as they don't replace it entirely. The example he gives is turmeric for a toddler's bruise, which he's okay with, but he's against giving up modern medical practices.\n\nHe brings up the financial aspect too, which might be a valid concern. Supporting a partner through a costly education could strain a relationship, especially if there's a disagreement on the value of that education. But the core issue seems to be the disagreement on medical beliefs. \n\nIn relationships, differing values can cause long-term issues. If both partners can't reconcile their views on something as significant as healthcare, it might lead to problems. The author is worried that her approach could lead patients to rely on placebos instead of seeking MDs, which could be dangerous. However, is that a reason to break up? It's a matter of how much weight such disagreements carry. \n\nOn the other hand, using money as the reason to break up might be a way to avoid the real issue of their conflicting worldviews. The author feels guilty because he believes love shouldn't be about material things. But he also feels it's a valid concern. \n\nI should think about whether his actions were justified. If the girlfriend is committed to a field that he finds ethically problematic, especially regarding patient safety, is that a deal-breaker? It's a personal decision, but it's important to consider if his concerns are based on valid scientific evidence or if he's dismissing her choices without understanding her perspective. \n\nThe author is in a lot of emotional pain, which is clear from his post. He's struggling with the idea that material reasons ended a 10-year relationship. However, the underlying issue is about fundamental beliefs that might affect their future together. If he can't accept her career path because of potential harm, maybe he's right to prioritize that. But if the relationship was healthy and the money was the real problem, maybe he's using that as an excuse. \n\nI need to balance between respecting personal choice and the potential consequences of her career. While naturopathy is controversial, it's not illegal, and people do choose it. The author's problem is with the pseudoscience aspect, which is a legitimate concern if he believes she's misinformed. But breaking up over that might be too extreme unless there's evidence she's intentionally harmful. \n\nThe example of her sister graduating and the author's fear that patients might die due to not seeing an MD is a strong point. However, naturopathic doctors, depending on the jurisdiction, might still need to follow some medical guidelines. The author might be overgeneralizing, though. \n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the validity and importance of his concerns. If the disagreement is about core values that affect their future and he can't accept them, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's being judgmental about her career choice without understanding her reasons, then he might be. The financial aspect is a separate issue, but it's intertwined here. Since he's the one making the decision, and the post is from his perspective, the answer might lean towards B (No) because he's prioritizing his values, but it's a close call. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. If the breakup was due to her career and beliefs, and if he's dismissing her choice without considering compromise, then A (Yes) could be the case. But the main issue is the pseudoscience and potential harm, which he genuinely cares about. So maybe B is the answer.\n"
