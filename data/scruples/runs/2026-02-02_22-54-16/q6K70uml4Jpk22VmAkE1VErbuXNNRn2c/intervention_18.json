Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the breakup story is in the wrong. They provided two options, A and B. I need to decide between them.\n\nFirst, I should break down the situation. The author broke up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), and he's against her beliefs in pseudoscience like homeopathy and the idea that vaccines cause autism. He's upset because he feels the breakup is over something material like school debt and differing views on medicine. \n\nHe mentions that love shouldn't be about money or life views but about caring. However, his core issue is that her career path and beliefs conflict with his values. He's torn because he still loves her but can't support her in this field. The breakup was prompted by financial concerns about her ND school debt, which he'd have to support her through. \n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, compatibility is key. If two people fundamentally disagree on important issues\u2014like medical beliefs and career paths\u2014that can cause irreconcilable differences. The author feels that her profession, which he views as pseudoscientific, could lead to harm, especially if she treats cancer patients. That's a significant concern, especially if he believes she's providing ineffective or harmful treatments. \n\nOn the other hand, ending a relationship over such issues might be seen as prioritizing personal values over love. But relationships require mutual respect and understanding. If both partners can't find common ground on such critical matters, it might not be sustainable. \n\nHe also feels guilty for bringing up money as the breaking point. However, financial responsibility is a practical aspect of a relationship. If he can't support her education and her career choice is a deal-breaker, it's a valid concern. \n\nThe question is whether he was in the wrong. If the core issue is differing values and beliefs that lead to an incompatible future, then it's not necessarily his fault. However, if he could have compromised or if there was a lack of communication, maybe. But in this case, the user's analysis suggests the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nI should consider if there's a middle ground. Could they have talked about it more? Maybe. But the story says they had an argument where money was the main point. He feels it's materialistic, but if her career is a non-negotiable for her and his support is non-negotiable for her, then it's a conflict. \n\nIn the end, if both individuals are equally committed to their views and can't find a way to coexist, it might be a tough decision. The author chose to end the relationship because he couldn't support her path, which he sees as harmful. While that's a hard decision, it's his right to prioritize his values. Therefore, he's not in the wrong because he made a tough choice based on his beliefs and the incompatibility of their futures.\n"
