Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this r/AmItheAsshole post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author broke up with his girlfriend because she wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), and he's concerned about her beliefs in pseudoscience and the debt from her education.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue seems to be the difference in their views on alternative medicine versus modern medicine. The author is against pseudoscience and is worried about the financial burden of her ND school, which costs around $200k. He also feels that relying on ND instead of MD could be dangerous, especially in cases where a cancer patient might not receive proper treatment.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is committed to her career choice, believing in the value of ND even though her views include some discredited ideas like the vaccine-autism link and homeopathy. The author is struggling with the fact that he ended a 10-year relationship over these issues, which he feels shouldn't matter, but they do to him.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. In relationships, there are many factors that can lead to a breakup. Compatibility in core values and future plans is often a significant factor. Here, both have strong beliefs: the author in evidence-based medicine and the girlfriend in ND. If their visions for the future are irreconcilable, it's not uncommon for a breakup to occur. \n\nThe financial aspect is also a practical concern. The $200k debt is a real burden, and the author might feel that supporting her through that isn't feasible. However, deciding to break up over financial support for a partner's education can be seen as materialistic, which the author himself acknowledges by saying it shouldn't matter but does to him.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for prioritizing his scientific beliefs and financial concerns over the relationship. On one hand, love can sometimes require compromise. But on the other hand, personal values and beliefs are fundamental. The author is concerned about the ethical implications of the girlfriend's future work, which he sees as potentially harmful. \n\nHowever, breaking up over differing opinions on career choices and medical beliefs might be a personal decision. The author feels conflicted, which is common in such situations. The key is whether the author acted unreasonably. He did try to discuss the issues, leading to an argument where money became a point. But the core issue is the fundamental disagreement on medical practices. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often looks at intent and fairness. The author isn't attacking the girlfriend's right to pursue her career but is concerned about the beliefs and practices she's committing to. The boyfriend's beliefs are valid to him, and the author's concerns are about those beliefs conflicting with his own values and potential real-world consequences.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's making a tough decision based on his values and the incompatibility of their future plans. The fact that he feels bad about it and acknowledges the emotional weight suggests he's not acting out of malice. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong). However, some might argue that he's dismissing her career choice without understanding the nuances of ND, but the author does mention he sees a place for ND as an alternative, not the main treatment, which shows some openness.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer is likely B.\n"
