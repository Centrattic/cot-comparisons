Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their girlfriend over her wanting to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) is in the wrong. The author feels conflicted because they love her but can't support her career choice due to differing views on science and medicine, plus financial concerns.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core reasons for the breakup. The main issues are her belief in pseudoscience (like vaccines causing autism, homeopathy) and the financial burden of ND school. The author is concerned about her future career path conflicting with their values and the debt they'd have to take on. \n\nOn one hand, love is supposed to be about accepting each other's differences. If her beliefs are so fundamental to her career, that's a deep part of her identity. The author might be prioritizing their own values over the relationship. But relationships also require mutual respect and compatibility. If the author can't support a career that they see as endorsing harmful practices, maybe that's a deal-breaker for them. \n\nFinancial aspects are another point. Taking on $200k debt is a big commitment. If the author feels they can't support that, it's a practical concern. However, it's possible the financial argument was a symptom of a deeper issue\u2014the fundamental disagreement about her career and beliefs. \n\nThe author also mentions feeling guilty and lost, which shows they care deeply. They tried to convince themselves it shouldn't matter, but it did. That suggests it's a significant incompatibility. \n\nIn relationships, when core values clash to the point of affecting future plans, it's hard to sustain. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for prioritizing their values over the relationship. Some might argue that personal beliefs shouldn't override love, but others might say that long-term happiness requires alignment in key areas. \n\nSo, considering the author's feelings of conflict and the reasons provided, it's a tough call. But since the question is whether they are in the wrong, and they tried to reconcile the issues but couldn't, it's more about personal compatibility than right or wrong. The answer might lean on whether the breakup was necessary due to irreconcilable differences. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong if they made the decision based on their own values and future vision.\n"
