Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her becoming a Naturopathic Doctor is in the wrong. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author mentions that his girlfriend is going to become an ND and believes in pseudoscience like homeopathy and the idea that vaccines cause autism. He's upset because he thinks alternative medicine that works is just regular medicine, and he can't support giving up modern medical practices. He also brings up financial issues, like $200k debt for her ND school, which he would have to support. He feels bad about ending the relationship over this, thinking love shouldn't be about money or life views, but their visions for the future are different.\n\nNow, to decide if he's in the wrong. On one hand, breaking up over differing beliefs might be seen as materialistic, but relationships also require shared values. If his partner's career involves promoting pseudoscience that could harm people (like avoiding modern medicine for cancer patients), that's a serious red flag. Financial burden is another practical concern. However, the author seems conflicted, feeling guilty for ending a 10-year relationship over these issues.\n\nThe key points are about core values and potential harm. If the ND practices could lead to real harm (e.g., patients not getting necessary MD treatments), the author might be right to be concerned. However, using financial pressure as a reason could be seen as less valid if the main issue is about differing beliefs. But since the partner is adamant about a career path he can't support, leading to incompatibility, it's a tough call.\n\nI think it's a case of incompatibility based on values. While the author feels guilty, if the core beliefs about health and science are irreconcilable, it's understandable he can't support her career. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to check if the reasoning aligns with ethical considerations.\n"
