Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the breakup story is in the wrong. The author broke up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and holds beliefs like vaccines causing autism and homeopathy being effective, which the author sees as pseudoscience. The author also mentions financial concerns about the ND school's cost.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue here: whether differing beliefs about medicine and career choices are valid reasons to end a relationship. Love and relationships often involve compromises, but there are lines where fundamental differences become deal-breakers. The author's main concerns are about pseudoscientific views and financial burden. \n\nThe girlfriend is committed to her career path, which the author finds problematic because he fears the ND's approach could be harmful, especially to patients like cancer patients. The author believes in modern medicine and is worried about her rejecting it. This is a significant ethical concern for him. \n\nOn the other hand, the author feels guilty because he's ending a 10-year relationship over material issues. But he also feels that his values and concerns about science and patient safety are critical. The question is whether these concerns justify the breakup. \n\nSome might argue that love should overcome such differences, but others might say that when it comes to health and ethics, those beliefs are non-negotiable. The financial aspect adds another layer, as the author is concerned about supporting her through expensive school. \n\nThe girlfriend's sister is also an ND, which might indicate a family value system that prioritizes this career path. The author seems to feel that his partner's career choice leads to practices that are unethical or harmful. \n\nIn relationships, core values often determine compatibility. If the author sees pseudoscience as a fundamental issue that he can't accept, then ending the relationship might be his way of staying true to his beliefs. However, if he could have found a way to support her while encouraging her to adopt more evidence-based practices, maybe the breakup could have been avoided. \n\nBut given the situation, the author made a difficult decision based on his values and concerns for patient safety. Whether that's right or wrong depends on perspective. The answer likely hinges on whether the differences are irreconcilable. Since the author tried to work through it but couldn't reconcile his beliefs with her career path, he might not be in the wrong. However, some might say he should have handled it differently, like seeking counseling or finding middle ground before breaking up. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong), as he acted according to his convictions about ethics and science, even though it's a tough call. But there's room for debate.\n"
