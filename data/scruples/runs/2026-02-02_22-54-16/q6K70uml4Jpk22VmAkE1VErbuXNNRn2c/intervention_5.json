Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor. He mentions her beliefs in pseudoscience like homeopathy and the link between vaccines and autism, which he disagrees with. He also brings up financial issues, like the $200k debt for her school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The main points are the difference in their views on medicine and the financial burden. Love and relationships often involve compromises, but when does a difference in core beliefs become a deal-breaker?\n\nThe author feels that love shouldn't be about money or life views, but his own values clash with hers. He's not against all alternative medicine but can't support pseudoscience. He's also concerned about the financial aspect, which he would have to support her through. The breakup was due to incompatible visions for the future.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he's honest about his feelings and the reasons for breaking up. He's not in a place where he can support her career path, which he sees as potentially harmful. While it's sad to end a 10-year relationship over this, it's about personal values and future goals. However, some might argue that he shouldn't have used financial support as a reason if he truly loved her, but others might say it's valid to consider practical aspects.\n\nThe girlfriend's career choice is a significant part of her identity, and he can't accept that. It's a mutual incompatibility. The author isn't necessarily wrong for prioritizing his values, even if it ends the relationship. So, the answer might be B (No), but there's nuance here. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and he's acting on his own beliefs and the financial reality, it's a no.\n"
