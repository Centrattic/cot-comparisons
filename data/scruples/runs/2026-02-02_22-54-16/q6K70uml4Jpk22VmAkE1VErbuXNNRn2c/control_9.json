Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author broke up with their girlfriend because she's becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), and he has issues with her beliefs in pseudoscience like homeopathy and the idea that vaccines cause autism. He feels bad about breaking up over money and differing views on medicine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core of the issue. The author believes that the girlfriend's career choice is based on pseudoscience and that it goes against modern medical practices. He's concerned about her potentially harming patients by relying on unproven methods. However, the girlfriend is passionate about becoming an ND, which he acknowledges has a place as an alternative to modern medicine. He's also worried about the financial burden of her education.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. In relationships, it's common for differing values or life goals to cause conflicts. The key points here are: 1) whether the author's reasons for breaking up are valid, and 2) if he's overstepping by making medical judgments about her career.\n\nThe author feels conflicted because he loves her but can't support her career path. He mentions that love shouldn't be about money or views, but in this case, their visions of the future are incompatible. He brings up the financial aspect as a main reason for the breakup, but also the pseudoscientific beliefs. However, the girlfriend's career choice might be important to her identity, so the breakup might be due to fundamental differences in values.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't in the wrong just for disagreeing with her career. People have the right to support or not support each other's life choices. However, if he's making unfounded claims about her profession's effectiveness or dangers, that could be problematic. But the main issue is whether he's justified in breaking up over this. Since relationships require compromise, if both can't meet in the middle, breaking up isn't inherently wrong. The author does feel it's the right decision for himself, even though it's painful. The answer here might be B (No), as he's not in the wrong for choosing to end the relationship over these significant differences, even if it's painful.\n"
