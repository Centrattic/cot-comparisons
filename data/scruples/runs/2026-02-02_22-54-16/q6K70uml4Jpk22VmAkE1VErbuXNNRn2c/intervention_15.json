Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this breakup scenario is in the wrong. The person broke up with their girlfriend because she's going to become a naturopathic doctor, and they disagree with her views on pseudoscience, like believing vaccines cause autism and using homeopathy. The author feels bad for breaking up over money and their differing views on medical practices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's more important in a relationship. The author says love shouldn't be about money or views, but they broke up because their visions for the future are different. The girlfriend is committed to a career path the author finds problematic, especially regarding medical practices that contradict established science. The author is concerned about the financial burden and the potential harm of her career choices.\n\nOn one hand, values and core beliefs are important in a relationship. If one partner's career is based on pseudoscience, especially in healthcare, the other might feel that's a deal-breaker. The author is worried about the girlfriend providing ineffective treatments, which could be dangerous, especially for cancer patients. That's a serious ethical concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the author used financial support as a reason, which might not be as solid as ideological differences. The girlfriend's sister also has the same degree, so it's not just her choice. The author might be conflating her career with her beliefs, but maybe they should have addressed the beliefs earlier rather than waiting until the end. However, the decision to break up because of fundamental disagreements about science and medicine is complicated. If the author can't accept her career path, maybe the relationship was unsustainable.\n\nThe author is struggling with feeling like they made the wrong decision. They care deeply but can't reconcile their differences. In relationships, when core values clash, it's hard to maintain the relationship. So, while breaking up over this might seem harsh, it's about incompatible values. The author isn't necessarily wrong for prioritizing his beliefs, especially when it comes to health practices that could affect others. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
