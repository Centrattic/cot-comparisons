Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend because she's becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) with views they disagree with.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author broke up because the girlfriend is going into ND, which they see as pseudoscientific, especially regarding beliefs like vaccines causing autism and using homeopathy. The author feels that NDs should only be an alternative and not replace modern medicine. The main issues are differing views on science, career choice, and financial burden of her education.\n\nThe author mentions that love shouldn't be about money or life views, but their future visions are conflicting. They ended the relationship over money (supporting her $200k debt) and ideological differences. The girlfriend's sister is also an ND, which adds to the conflict.\n\nI need to evaluate if the break-up is justified. The author's reasoning centers around the ND field's legitimacy and potential harm. They feel they can't support a career that might provide ineffective treatments. The girlfriend is \"dead set\" on this path, so compromise isn't possible.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. From a perspective of respecting others' choices, the author might be overstepping by ending the relationship over her career and beliefs. However, if their values are fundamentally incompatible and they can't reconcile, the break-up isn't necessarily wrong. The key factors are whether the author's reasons are valid and if they had other options besides breaking up.\n\nThe author feels conflicted, which is understandable. But if they can't accept her career and beliefs, staying together might lead to ongoing conflict. On the other hand, using money and career choice as the basis for a break-up could be seen as materialistic. However, the author also cites concerns about pseudoscience and potential harm, which might be a matter of personal ethics.\n\nI think the answer isn't straightforward. The author might not be in the wrong if they believe their partner's career could cause harm and they can't compromise. However, some might argue that personal beliefs shouldn't dictate a relationship's end, especially if the partner isn't harming others directly. The financial aspect is also a factor, but supporting a partner's education is a personal choice.\n\nConsidering all angles, the author's actions are based on their values and concerns, which are valid to them. Since they tried to love and care but couldn't reconcile the differences, the break-up is a personal decision. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
