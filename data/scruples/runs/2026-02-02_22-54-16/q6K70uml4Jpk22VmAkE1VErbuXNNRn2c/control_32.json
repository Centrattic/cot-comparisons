Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is they broke up with their girlfriend because she wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor. The author is conflicted, feeling like they're being a bad person because love shouldn't be about money or life views, but their future visions are different.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The girlfriend is going into ND, which the author views as pseudoscience, especially regarding her beliefs about vaccinations and homeopathy. The author mentions that they can accept alternative medicine if it's used as a complement, like using turmeric for a bruise, but can't support giving up modern medicine. The main argument that led to the breakup was about the $200k debt for her ND school, which the author would have to support. They feel guilty because their 10-year relationship ended over financial and professional disagreements.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong to break up. Let's break it down. In relationships, major disagreements can lead to breakups. The author is concerned about the financial burden and the girlfriend's stance on pseudoscience. They think NDs have a place as an alternative, not a replacement for modern medicine. The girlfriend's sister is also an ND, which might indicate a family commitment to the field.\n\nThe author's reasons: 1) Financial obligation of $200k. 2) Disagreement over pseudoscientific views, fearing that if she uses them instead of modern medicine, patients might die. They feel that their core values (scientific approach) are incompatible with her career choice.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is passionate about her career and her beliefs. The author's friends and family say it shouldn't matter, but they feel it does. The author is struggling with guilt, thinking they ended the relationship over material issues. \n\nIs it wrong to base a breakup on such reasons? Well, when two people have fundamentally different values that affect each other's lives, like career paths and views on science and medicine, it's a significant issue. The financial aspect is a practical concern, but the author's main issue seems to be the pseudoscientific beliefs. The key is whether these differences were a dealbreaker from the start or something they only realized later. The author mentions that the vision of their future is different, so maybe this was a long-standing issue.\n\nBut is it wrong to end the relationship because of that? If one person's career choice is based on beliefs that the other finds harmful or unethical, that could be a valid reason. The author is worried that as an ND, she might rely on unproven methods (homeopathy) instead of evidence-based medicine, which could be dangerous, especially for cancer patients. If they couldn't reconcile this fundamental difference, even after discussions, then the breakup might be seen as necessary for the author to protect their values and possibly prevent future conflicts. \n\nHowever, the author is also using financial support as a reason. That could be seen as a materialistic reason. But if the author feels they can't support a career that they believe is based on pseudoscience, then the financial burden is tied to their values. It's a complex situation because it's not just about money but about the ethical implications of the girlfriend's career path. \n\nIn some contexts, people might argue that the author is overstepping by making a decision based on their partner's career choices unless there's a risk of harm. On the other hand, if the author's belief is that the career is unethical or dangerous, they might feel that supporting it would compromise their own values. The author does acknowledge that NDs have a place as an alternative, but not as a replacement, which shows they aren't entirely against it, but the specific pseudoscientific beliefs are the problem.\n\nThe girlfriend's firm stance on her career and beliefs, and the author's inability to support that, even though they loved each other, might make this a case of irreconcilable differences. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the breakup was due to a core value conflict that the author couldn't accept, then it's not necessarily the author's fault. However, if the author is using the financial aspect as a cover for not accepting her beliefs, that's a different matter. \n\nThe author feels guilty but also that their future visions are incompatible. It's possible that the author is not in the wrong because they can't force themselves to support a career path they fundamentally disagree with, especially when it involves beliefs they consider harmful. However, others might argue that it's wrong to end a long-term relationship over such issues, as it's possible to support each other despite differences. \n\nI think it's a nuanced case. The author's decision is based on both financial and ethical concerns. The pseudoscientific beliefs are a red flag if the author can't accept them, especially in a healthcare context. But the financial support part is a practical issue. Since the author tried to rationalize it as a core value conflict, maybe they are justified. However, if they could have found a way to support her without compromising their own views, that might be a different story. \n\nBut given the information, the main issue is the pseudoscientific views and the author's inability to support a career that might lead to practices they find unethical. So, the author might not be in the wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted because love is supposed to be about accepting each other's differences. However, in cases where there's a risk of harm or a fundamental ethical disagreement, it's a valid reason to break up. The answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are acting based on their values and concerns.\n"
