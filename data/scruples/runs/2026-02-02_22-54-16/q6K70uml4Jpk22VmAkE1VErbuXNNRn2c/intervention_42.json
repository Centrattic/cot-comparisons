Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend because she's becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) is at fault. The situation involves differing beliefs about medicine and the financial burden of her education.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author values evidence-based medicine and is concerned about pseudoscience, like homeopathy and the discredited link between vaccines and autism. He also mentions the financial aspect of her ND school, which costs $200k. He broke up because he couldn't support her career choice, which he sees as promoting unscientific practices. The girlfriend is \"dead set\" on this path, and he feels the future they envisioned is incompatible.\n\nNow, the question is whether his reasons are valid. Relationships require mutual respect and shared values. If both partners can't agree on core issues, like the importance of scientific validity in healthcare, that's a major red flag. The author is worried that NDs might harm patients by relying on pseudoscience instead of evidence-based medicine. That's a serious concern, especially with cancer patients, where alternative treatments could be life-threatening if used in place of proven therapies.\n\nOn the other hand, love and relationships can sometimes require compromise. The author acknowledges that love shouldn't be about money or views on life but rather about care and love. However, his decision was based on fundamental disagreements about science and medicine, which are non-negotiable for him. It's possible that the relationship was already strained by these differences, leading to the breakup.\n\nThe financial aspect is another factor. Supporting a $200k debt for a career he disagrees with is a significant burden. While it's true that relationships should transcend material issues, in reality, practical considerations do play a role. The author might feel that the financial commitment conflicts with his values, making the decision difficult but necessary.\n\nHowever, the author's approach\u2014breaking up over this without finding a middle ground\u2014could be seen as harsh. Maybe there was room for compromise or understanding. But if both sides are unwilling to budge on such a critical issue, it's understandable he chose to end the relationship. The key here is whether the decision was based on valid concerns (like patient safety and financial responsibility) versus personal judgment.\n\nIn conclusion, while the breakup is painful, the author's reasons are based on significant ethical and practical concerns. If the relationship couldn't overcome these core disagreements, he's not necessarily in the wrong. However, some might argue that it's not his place to judge her career choice, even if he disagrees. But given the potential consequences of her work, his stance might be justified. So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
