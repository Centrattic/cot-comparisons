Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The person broke up with their girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor, and they have conflicting views on medicine. The user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is upset because the girlfriend believes in pseudoscience like the link between vaccines and autism, and homeopathy, which are not supported by science. They mention that NDs have their place as an alternative but can't support giving up modern medicine. The main issues they brought up were the financial burden of her school debt and her beliefs conflicting with his views on science-based medicine.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels guilty because they ended a 10-year relationship over money and career choices. They acknowledge that love should be about caring, but their visions for the future are incompatible. He's struggling with whether he was right to end it.\n\nNow, considering the principles of relationships: mutual respect, communication, and compatibility. It's clear that they disagree on core values\u2014scientific beliefs and career paths. When core values clash, it can lead to irreconcilable differences. The author felt that the financial commitment of her education was too much, which adds another layer of stress. If the girlfriend was dead set on this path despite his concerns, maybe the author felt it was a deal-breaker.\n\nBut is it the author's fault? Well, they tried to talk about it. The breakup was a last resort after arguments. The author's guilt suggests they tried to hold on but felt it was the right choice for their future. However, ending a long-term relationship over differing beliefs and financial issues could be seen as prioritizing personal values over the relationship. However, it's also valid to want a partner who aligns with your scientific views, especially when it comes to healthcare decisions. If the author felt that her career would lead to harmful practices, that's a significant concern.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Relationships require compromise, but there's a point where personal values become non-negotiable. If the author couldn't support her career due to those beliefs, maybe the breakup was unavoidable. However, if the author focused too much on material aspects (money) rather than addressing the deeper philosophical differences, they might be in the wrong. But the text shows he considered both their future and his feelings about pseudoscience, which are valid concerns.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might feel guilty, the decision was based on incompatible core values and financial realities. It's not necessarily wrong to end a relationship if the differences are unresolvable. So, the answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong, because the breakup was due to fundamental disagreements that can't be reconciled.\n"
