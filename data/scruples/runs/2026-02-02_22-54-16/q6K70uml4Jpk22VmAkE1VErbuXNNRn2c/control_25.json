Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's becoming a Naturopathic Doctor and believes in pseudoscience like vaccines causing autism.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue here. The author is conflicted because he broke up with his girlfriend over her career choice and beliefs. He feels it's wrong because love shouldn't be about money or life views, but he can't reconcile their differing views on medicine. The girlfriend is going into ND, which he views as pseudoscience, especially concerning homeopathy and vaccine-autism link. He's worried about her using ineffective treatments, possibly leading to harm. The breakup was partly about the financial burden of her school and his unwillingness to support a career he disagrees with.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong, I should consider a few angles. One is whether it's reasonable to break up over this. The author feels guilty because he values love over material things, but his decision was based on a fundamental disagreement about science and ethics. Another point is the validity of his concerns. ND is a controversial field; some see it as complementary, others as dangerous. The author is concerned about patients not getting proper medical care, which could lead to real harm, especially in cases like cancer. That's a valid worry from a public health perspective.\n\nHowever, is it fair to end a relationship over differing beliefs? In a healthy relationship, partners should respect each other's choices unless those choices are harmful. But if one partner's career involves promoting practices that could be harmful, is that a deal-breaker? The author is justified in being concerned about his partner's career leading to ineffective or harmful treatments. However, he might not have explored whether she could integrate both ND and conventional medicine, or if her approach is more holistic but not against mainstream medicine.\n\nThe financial aspect is another point. Taking on $200k debt for ND school is a significant commitment. If the author couldn't support that financially or emotionally, it's a valid reason for conflict. Yet, breaking up solely over the money might overlook the deeper issue of opposing values regarding medical practices.\n\nThe question is whether the author's actions were wrong. If he genuinely believes that supporting a career in ND would mean endorsing harmful practices, then his decision is based on ethical concerns. However, if he dismissed her career without understanding her approach or if his concerns are exaggerated, then he might be in the wrong. The line between valid concern and overstepping is thin here.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's guilt stems from breaking up over what he sees as a material issue (money) and differing views. But his underlying concern is about ethical and health-related issues. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether those concerns are legitimate. Since promoting pseudoscientific treatments can indeed have real consequences, his stance isn't without merit. Still, ending a 10-year relationship over this might be seen as extreme unless there's mutual understanding that it's untenable. However, if he's not willing to support her in a way that's necessary for her career, maybe the breakup is a result of irreconcilable differences, which isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
