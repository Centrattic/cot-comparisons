Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and believes in pseudoscience like vaccination-autism links. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong and wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author ended a 10-year relationship because they disagree with the girlfriend's career choice, which they see as based on pseudoscience. The main issues are the career path, beliefs in discredited medical practices, and financial burden of ND school. The author feels bad about using money as a reason for the breakup.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. Relationships can be complex. Disagreements over core values like healthcare beliefs might be a deal-breaker for some. The author is concerned about pseudoscience in medicine, which could affect patient outcomes, especially in cancer treatment. They also mention the financial aspect of supporting her through school, which is a practical concern.\n\nOn the other hand, using someone's career choice and personal beliefs as a reason to end a long-term relationship might be seen as materialistic. The author emphasizes love and caring but still chose to break up. The question is whether this decision is justified or if it's a valid reason for ending the relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend's career is in an area the author disagrees with, but some people might argue that personal beliefs shouldn't interfere in a relationship unless there's direct harm. However, in healthcare, beliefs can have real consequences. The author's concern about pseudoscience leading to harm (like avoiding MDs) is valid from a medical standpoint.\n\nThe financial argument is another point. The author might feel that taking on significant debt for a career path they disagree with is unsustainable. However, should financial support in education be a deal-breaker? That depends on mutual agreement and communication. If the couple couldn't compromise, maybe it was a necessary decision for the author.\n\nThe author's feelings of guilt and confusion are genuine, but they still made a choice based on their values. In AITA scenarios, people often debate whether core values vs. love should be prioritized. Some might say the author is right to prioritize their beliefs, others might say it's wrong to end a relationship over such issues.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong is subjective. However, the key factors are: 1) Disagreement over healthcare beliefs with potential patient risks, 2) Financial commitment for a career the author opposes. Given these, the author's decision could be seen as a matter of personal values, so the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But others might argue that love should override such disagreements. The community's opinion often depends on the severity of the issues and the couple's communication. Since the author tried to justify their stance as being about values and safety, it's plausible they're not in the wrong.\n"
