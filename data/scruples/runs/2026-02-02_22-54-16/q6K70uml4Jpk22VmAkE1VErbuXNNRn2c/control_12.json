Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her decision to become a Naturopathic Doctor.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author broke up because his girlfriend is going into ND, which he associates with pseudoscience like homeopathy and beliefs that vaccines cause autism. He also mentions financial concerns about her student debt. He feels conflicted because he loved her a lot and thinks love shouldn't be about money or views, but he couldn't reconcile their different visions for the future.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. \n\n1. **Beliefs and Values**: The author has strong opinions about modern medicine versus alternative practices. His girlfriend is committed to a field he views as unscientific. This is a significant difference in values. When two people can't agree on such fundamental aspects, it can lead to irreconcilable differences.\n\n2. **Financial Burden**: He brings up the $200k debt for her ND school, which he would have to support. Financial stress is a common reason for relationship issues. However, it's important to consider if this was a mutual decision or if he felt it was an obligation. If he's not willing to take on that debt, it's a valid concern.\n\n3. **Health Beliefs and Risk**: The author is worried that as an ND, she might not rely on modern medicine, which could be dangerous, especially for cancer patients. He mentions the risk of people dying because they rely on placebo instead of MDs. This is a serious concern about her future profession's potential to harm others. However, in many places, NDs can work alongside conventional doctors, but the author's fear is that she might reject modern medicine entirely.\n\n4. **Communication and Conflict**: The breakup resulted from an argument about money. The author feels bad for using that as the main point, but he might have felt it was the practical aspect of the bigger issue of differing values. The question is whether the money was the root cause or a symptom of their deeper disagreements.\n\n5. **Ethical Considerations**: Is it right to end a relationship over someone's career choice and beliefs? If the girlfriend's profession could potentially harm others (as the author fears), then his concern is about ethical responsibility. However, NDs are licensed in many places, so maybe his view is based on misinformation. There's a difference between pseudoscience and regulated alternative medicine.\n\n6. **Emotional Impact**: The author is clearly emotionally distressed, as this was a 10-year relationship. He feels guilty, but the question is whether his reasoning is justifiable.\n\nNow, considering all these points. In relationships, it's common for people to break up over core differences that affect their future together. If the girlfriend is committed to a career path that the author fundamentally disagrees with, especially on matters of health and science, that's a significant incompatibility. The financial aspect is a practical concern. However, the argument over money leading to the breakup might be a symptom of deeper values conflict.\n\nThe author's concern about her beliefs leading to harm is a matter of opinion. If NDs are regulated and her practice is within legal and ethical boundaries, his criticism might be unfounded. However, if she genuinely believes in pseudoscience (like vaccines causing autism), that's a different matter. The author might be right to worry about her professional decisions affecting patients, but that's a complex issue depending on her actual practices.\n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's subjective. If he's breaking up because of her career and beliefs, it's his right, but if the breakup is due to fear-based reasoning without understanding her perspective, he might be acting out of fear rather than love. However, the fact that they've discussed this and couldn't find common ground might make the breakup a necessary decision for his peace of mind.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author's concerns are valid. If the girlfriend's career is based on pseudoscience that could harm others, the author has a point. But if he's overreacting to legitimate, regulated practices, then he's in the wrong. The post mentions her sister graduated from the same school, implying some legitimacy, but the author still distrusts it. The key is whether her beliefs are objectively harmful. The line between alternative and pseudoscience can be blurry.\n\nGiven that the author feels conflicted and that the breakup is causing him emotional pain, but his reasoning is based on his values and concerns about her profession's potential to harm, it's a tough call. However, since relationships require mutual respect, if the author can't accept her career and beliefs, and vice versa, the breakup might be a consequence of their incompatibility, not necessarily him being in the wrong.\n"
