Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend over her becoming a Naturopathic Doctor. Let me start by understanding both sides.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their girlfriend is going into a field they disagree with. She believes in things like vaccinations causing autism and homeopathy, which are pseudoscientific. The author thinks that NDs have a place but can't support giving up modern medicine. They also mention financial issues, like $200k in debt for school, which they can't support. The breakup happened because their visions for the future are different, especially regarding her career choice and her beliefs in alternative medicine.\n\nThe author feels guilty because they thought love should transcend these issues, but they couldn't reconcile their differences. They're struggling with the fact that the breakup was over \"material\" things like money and school, not just love. Friends and family told them it shouldn't matter, but they feel it does.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, in a relationship, major differences in core values can be deal-breakers. If someone's career choice is based on beliefs that the partner finds harmful (like dismissing vaccines which are proven effective, or using homeopathy which is considered pseudoscience), that could lead to serious ethical concerns. The author is worried that the ND might provide ineffective treatments, which could be dangerous, especially for cancer patients. That's a valid concern because medical malpractice or harm can be a significant issue.\n\nOn the other hand, love and relationships often require compromise. The author loves their partner deeply but can't support a career path they view as potentially harmful. But is that a fair reason to break up? It's complicated. The financial aspect plays a role too\u2014supporting such a costly education could strain the relationship further. However, the main issue seems to be the ideological clash over medical practices and beliefs.\n\nBut wait, the author also says they understand the overprescription problem in modern medicine. They acknowledge that NDs have a place but can't accept pseudoscience. The girlfriend's sister is already a graduate, so it's not just a personal choice but a family path. The author might feel that the girlfriend is set in her ways and won't compromise, making the relationship unsustainable.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships are personal, and what's acceptable varies. However, if the partner's beliefs could lead to real harm (e.g., advising against evidence-based treatments), that's a red flag. The author is prioritizing their values over the relationship, which can be justified if they believe staying would compromise their own principles and potentially cause harm. But breaking up over this might be seen as putting personal ethics above love, which can be a tough call.\n\nAnother angle: the author could have tried to work through the differences, but if they've already tried and it's irreconcilable, then the breakup might be necessary. However, using money as the main point might have been a surface-level issue, but underlying it is the deeper conflict about values. The author's guilt suggests they feel conflicted, which is normal in such situations.\n\nSo, considering all that, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. If the girlfriend's career path is based on pseudoscience that the author finds harmful and they can't support, maybe it's understandable. But relationships require compromise, and maybe the author should have found a way to support her despite their disagreements. However, if the author truly believes that her work could lead to harmful outcomes, they might be protecting others by ending the relationship.\n"
