Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend because she's becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and believes in pseudoscience like homeopathy and the vaccine-autism link. The author feels conflicted because they love her but can't support her career choice due to health concerns and financial reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman's career choice is in conflict with the author's beliefs about medicine. The author is concerned about her promoting pseudoscience, which could harm patients, especially cancer patients. The financial aspect is also a factor here, with $200k in debt. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that while they love her, their visions for the future don't align. Love and compatibility in core values can be a valid reason for breaking up. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the author is standing by their beliefs regarding science and medicine. They might think it's wrong to support practices they consider harmful. On the other hand, breaking up over this could be seen as dismissing the other person's career and life choices, which could be seen as judgmental. \n\nThe financial burden is another aspect. The author mentions they would have to support her through the debt, which adds a practical concern. But is that a fair reason to break up if it's about differing values? \n\nAlso, the author acknowledges that love should be about caring, but they feel the differences in vision make the relationship unsustainable. It's a tough call. In relationships, differing values can lead to breakups, especially if they're fundamental and non-negotiable. However, if the issue is about someone's career choice and the author's personal beliefs about it, it's a matter of whether that's a deal-breaker. \n\nThe author's friends and family say it shouldn't matter, but the author disagrees. The key is whether the author is in the wrong for prioritizing their views over the relationship. Since it's a personal decision and they genuinely feel the incompatibility, it might not be wrong. But if the concern is about the ND's potential harm, maybe the author is justified. However, it's their choice to end the relationship, even if others might see it as harsh. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they made a difficult decision based on their values and incompatibility in life goals, even though it's a painful choice. They aren't necessarily wrong for choosing to end a relationship where core values clash, even if others disagree with their reasoning.\n"
