Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend over her becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND). The author feels conflicted because they love each other, but their views on medicine and future plans differ significantly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issues are the girlfriend's belief in pseudoscience (like vaccines causing autism, homeopathy) and the author's concern about the ND program's debt and the potential risks of relying on alternative medicine over modern practices. The breakup was partly about money\u2014supporting her 200k debt for a 4-year ND school. The author also mentions that his family and friends think it shouldn't matter, but he feels it does.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Relationships often face conflicts where personal values clash. The author's concerns about pseudoscience and financial burden are valid. However, love and relationships can also involve compromise. The question is whether the author overstepped by making the breakup about these issues instead of finding a middle ground.\n\nOn one hand, the author might be right to worry about the financial strain and the potential risks of pseudoscientific practices, especially if he's not comfortable with them. On the other hand, ending a 10-year relationship over these issues might seem extreme, especially if the core of the problem is about differing beliefs that don't directly impact each other's lives. The fact that the author feels so bad afterward suggests he's conflicted, which could indicate that he sees the breakup as a last resort but is still troubled by it.\n\nThe girlfriend's commitment to ND work, despite the author's objections, shows her dedication to her career and beliefs. If the author can't support her in that, it might be a fundamental incompatibility. However, love is supposed to involve acceptance, even of differing views. The author might be right in prioritizing his values, but maybe he's also wrong for not finding a way to coexist with her choices.\n\nAnother angle: the breakup was triggered by money and differing views on medicine. The author's friends and family say it shouldn't matter, which could mean that his reasoning isn't as solid as he thinks. The fact that he's breaking up over something that others say shouldn't matter might imply he's in the wrong. But if the financial burden is unmanageable and the medical views are a deal-breaker for his peace of mind, then maybe it's justified.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that he supports NDs as alternatives but can't condone giving up modern medicine. The girlfriend's sister graduated from the same school, so maybe the author's fears are based on stereotypes rather than reality. If the ND program actually combines modern and alternative methods, his concerns might be unfounded. However, if the program genuinely promotes pseudoscience, then the author has valid concerns.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer hinges on whether the author's reasons are justified enough to end a long-term relationship. If the issues are about core values and the author can't live with the differences, it's not necessarily his fault. But if he's prioritizing material concerns over love without a strong enough reason, he might be in the wrong. The key is whether the breakup was a necessary decision based on incompatibility or an overreaction. The fact that he's so conflicted suggests he's not entirely sure, which complicates the answer.\n"
