Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her decision to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND). The author feels conflicted because he values love and caring, but he can't reconcile with the pseudoscientific aspects of her career choice, like the anti-vaccine stance and homeopathy. He also brought up financial reasons, like the debt for ND school, which he would have to support. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The breakup was over differing values: the author's belief in modern medicine versus her support for alternative medicine that he views as pseudoscience. He's struggling because he loves her but can't accept her career path.\n\nOn one hand, people have the right to choose their career and beliefs. If the girlfriend is committed to ND, that's her choice. But the author feels that her beliefs are based on pseudoscience, which could conflict with his own values. The financial aspect is also a factor\u2014supporting her through school might be a significant burden.\n\nBut then again, relationships often require compromise. If the author couldn't accept her beliefs as a fundamental part of her life, maybe the breakup wasn't about money alone but about deeper incompatibilities. However, bringing up financial issues as a reason might be valid, especially if he feels it's a strain on their future.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Some might argue that his decision is based on her career and beliefs, which are personal choices, and that he shouldn't have let that dictate their relationship. Others might see it as reasonable to part ways if core values are irreconcilable, especially when it comes to such significant issues as healthcare views and financial commitment.\n\nThe user mentioned that the author's friends said it shouldn't matter, but he still feels it does. The emotional pain he's experiencing shows it's a tough call. However, the key is whether the author acted in the wrong. If he genuinely couldn't accept her path and this led to the breakup, maybe it was a necessary decision, even if painful. But if the breakup was primarily about financial support rather than her beliefs, that might be a different angle.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer hinges on whether the breakup was due to incompatible beliefs (which is a valid reason) or if it was an excuse for other issues. Since the author explicitly states that her career path and beliefs are the main reasons, it's a matter of differing values. In such cases, people are not in the wrong for parting ways when core values conflict. So the answer might be B (No), but I need to check if there's any indication of other factors.\n"
