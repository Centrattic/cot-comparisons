Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this breakup story is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author broke up with his girlfriend because she wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), which he associates with pseudoscience. He mentions issues like her belief in vaccinations causing autism and homeopathy, which are debunked. He also talks about the financial burden of her ND school, which is $200k over four years, and he can't support that financially. He's feeling guilty because he thought love shouldn't be about money or differing views, but he couldn't reconcile their future visions.\n\nNow, the user is asking if he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, from a relationship standpoint, disagreements over core values can lead to breakups. Here, the author is concerned about pseudoscience in her chosen career, which he sees as potentially harmful. He also brings up financial reasons\u2014supporting her education would be a significant financial burden. \n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend is pursuing a career in naturopathy, which he disagrees with. If someone is entering a field that he fundamentally opposes, especially one that he believes could be dangerous, that's a big deal. He's worried that her practices might lead patients to forego proven medical treatments. From a scientific standpoint, that's a valid concern. \n\nOn the other hand, the breakup was over a significant financial commitment. The author mentions he can't support her through school financially. That's a practical concern. However, he's also bringing up ideological differences. The question is whether it's reasonable to end a 10-year relationship over these issues.\n\nSome people might argue that personal values and beliefs are crucial in a long-term relationship. If the author truly believes that her career path is unethical or harmful, that could be a deal-breaker. Others might say that love should overcome such differences, especially if both parties aren't harming each other directly. The financial aspect is another layer. If the author can't support her education financially, maybe they should have discussed that earlier, rather than letting it lead to a breakup.\n\nBut then, if the girlfriend is dead set on going into ND despite his objections, maybe he felt that their future was incompatible. The author is conflicted, feeling guilty but also certain that his beliefs and financial situation are incompatible with her path. \n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, it's a nuanced situation. Ending a long-term relationship is never easy, but if there's a fundamental disagreement on values that affect each other's lives, it's not necessarily wrong to part ways. However, using financial reasons as a basis could be seen as materialistic, which the author himself criticizes. \n\nHe also mentions that his friends and family say it shouldn't matter, but he disagrees with them. Maybe the key is whether the decision was made out of genuine concern for her patients' well-being and financial responsibility. If he believes she's entering a harmful field, even if others don't share his view, he might feel justified. \n\nIn conclusion, while the decision is painful and perhaps premature, if the author's concerns are valid and the couple can't find common ground, it's not necessarily in the wrong. The answer would lean towards B (No), but with the understanding that both sides have valid points. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, so I need to decide based on the information given.\n"
