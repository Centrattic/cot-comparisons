Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND). Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is upset because they broke up, and he feels guilty. He loves her a lot, but their future visions are different. The main issues he brings up are her belief in pseudoscience (like vaccines causing autism, homeopathy) and the financial aspect of her ND school, which would put her around $200k in debt. He doesn't think he can support someone who rejects modern medicine and is going into a field he views as pseudoscientific. He also mentions that using alternative medicine is okay as a complement but not as a replacement for modern medicine.\n\nThe girlfriend is determined to attend ND school, which the author sees as a problem. He's worried about supporting her through that debt and the ethical implications of her future work, potentially giving placebos instead of proper medical treatment, especially for cancer patients. He feels like the breakup is over material issues, which he regrets because he thought love shouldn't be about money or beliefs.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he's making a decision based on his values and concerns about her career and beliefs, which he sees as conflicting with his own. On the other hand, people have the right to their career choices and beliefs unless they directly harm others. However, the girlfriend's future actions (if she advises against modern medicine) might have serious consequences, like someone dying because they didn't seek proper medical care. \n\nBut in a relationship, it's about mutual respect. If the author can't accept her profession and beliefs, maybe the breakup was inevitable. However, the way he framed the breakup\u2014focusing on money and material things\u2014makes him feel guilty. But relationships often require compromise. If both can't find a middle ground, breaking up isn't necessarily wrong. The key is whether the reason is valid. His concern about harmful pseudoscience is a matter of safety and ethics, which he might feel strongly about. But others might argue that her choice is hers and that he shouldn't impose his views. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the breakup is based on core values and potential harm, maybe not. If it's just about differences he could have worked through, maybe. But given the gravity of the issues (healthcare decisions affecting patients), some might side with him. Others might say it's too harsh, and love should overcome such differences. It's a tough call. But since the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, maybe the answer is B. However, I need to decide based on the reasoning.\n"
