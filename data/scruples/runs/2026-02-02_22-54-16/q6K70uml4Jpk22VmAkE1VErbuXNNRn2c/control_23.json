Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given text is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), citing her beliefs in pseudoscience like homeopathy and the anti-vaccine stance. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author values modern medicine and is concerned about the girlfriend's field being based on pseudoscience, which he believes could be harmful, especially when dealing with serious conditions like cancer. He also mentions financial concerns about the ND program and the debt.\n\nNow, relationships often involve differences in values. The question is whether the author's decision was justified. On one hand, love and relationships should ideally be about mutual respect and understanding. If the core values, especially those that could affect each other's well-being or ethical views on healthcare, are irreconcilable, then a breakup might be seen as a matter of personal values. The author is worried about her beliefs leading to harmful practices, which he can't support. \n\nOn the other hand, breaking up over such a specific career choice and beliefs might be seen as insensitive, especially if the relationship was long-term (10 years). The author is conflicted, feeling guilty because he loves her deeply but can't accept her career path. The reasons he gives\u2014scientific disagreement and financial concerns\u2014are valid for some people, but others might argue that these are not personal attacks and that love should transcend such differences.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's reasons are morally wrong. If he's not forcing her to change her beliefs or interfering in her career, but rather parting ways because of a fundamental disagreement, then maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if the breakup is based on shaming her choices or not respecting her autonomy, then he might be. The text shows he respects that NDs have a place as alternatives but can't support moving away from modern medicine. That seems like a value judgment, which is personal but not necessarily wrong. \n\nThe financial aspect is a practical concern, but tying it to the breakup might complicate things. However, the author's main point is the ideological conflict. Ultimately, whether he's in the wrong depends on perspective. If the breakup is due to a matter of personal values and not because of abuse or coercion, some might say it's his right to leave. Others might say love should overcome such differences. The answer likely leans towards B (No), as the author isn't necessarily wrong for prioritizing his values, even if it's a tough decision.\n"
