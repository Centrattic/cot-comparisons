Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor and believes in pseudoscience like homeopathy and the idea that vaccines cause autism. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the guy is upset that he broke up with his girlfriend over her career choice and her beliefs in alternative medicine. He loves her but can't reconcile their differences in views on medicine. He mentions she's going into a field he considers pseudoscientific, and he's worried about her practicing something that could be harmful, like giving up modern medicine for cancer patients. He also brought up the financial aspect of her ND school, which is around $200k debt, and he said he would have to support her through it.\n\nNow, I need to determine if he's the asshole here. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, he's ending a 10-year relationship because of her career and beliefs. He's concerned about her potentially harmful practices, which is a valid concern, especially if she's working with cancer patients. He might believe that her approach is dangerous and not evidence-based. On the other hand, love and relationships often involve accepting each other's differences, and career choices can be personal. However, when it comes to beliefs that could affect others' health, like rejecting vaccinations or using homeopathy for serious conditions, that's a different matter. \n\nHe says he's not against alternative medicine per se but can't support pseudoscience. He's worried about her giving up modern medicine. The financial aspect is also a factor here\u2014supporting her through a costly education might be a burden he's not willing to take on. But is that a valid reason to break up? If the relationship can't handle financial stress, that's a problem. However, if her career path involves practices he finds harmful, that's a deal-breaker for him, even if it's a tough decision.\n\nThe key points here are the differing values and the potential harm of her future work. If she's going into a field that he considers dangerous, especially for patients, that's a significant ethical issue for him. While relationships should tolerate differences, when it comes to beliefs that could directly impact people's health negatively, it's understandable that he might feel conflicted. However, breaking up over this might be seen as not accepting her for who she is, unless the belief is causing direct harm to their relationship or others. \n\nHis friends and family told him it shouldn't matter, but he still feels it's a material issue. That shows there's internal conflict. The fact that he's feeling so guilty and lost after the breakup suggests he's torn between his love for her and his core beliefs. \n\nIn terms of the decision to break up, it's a personal choice, but whether he's wrong depends on the validity of his concerns. If her work could lead to actual harm (e.g., advising cancer patients to forgo MDs), that's a serious issue. However, if he's using the financial burden as a way to escape the relationship, maybe he's not considering other solutions. But he did bring up the money as a point, which complicates things. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the action taken is justified. The author's actions are based on a fundamental difference in values regarding science and healthcare. If he can't accept her career and beliefs, breaking up is a difficult but possibly justified decision for him, even if others think it's too harsh. However, if the break-up was primarily about money and not the beliefs, that's a different angle. But the post indicates it's a mix of both. \n\nSo, considering all that, he might not be in the wrong because he's standing by his values about science and patient safety. However, there's a part where using money as a reason to break up might be seen as materialistic. But given the potential risks of her career path, it's a complex issue. The community might split, but in this case, the answer is likely B (No, he's not in the wrong) because his concerns about pseudoscience affecting health are valid, even if the decision is painful.\n"
