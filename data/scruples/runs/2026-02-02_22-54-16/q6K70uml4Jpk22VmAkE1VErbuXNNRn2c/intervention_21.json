Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and holds some pseudoscientific beliefs. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author loved his girlfriend but couldn't reconcile their different views on medicine. The girlfriend believes in alternative medicine, like homeopathy, and thinks vaccines cause autism, which is debunked. The author values modern medicine and can't support her career choice, especially because of the financial burden of ND school and the potential risks of her future practice.\n\nSo, why did he break up? He mentions the financial aspect and differing beliefs. He feels guilty because he thought love should transcend money and life views. But his core issue is the conflict in their worldviews, specifically around medical science.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Is it valid for him to break up over this? Relationships require compatibility in core values. If someone's career and beliefs are fundamentally at odds with your own, especially when it comes to health and science, that's a big deal. The author is concerned about his partner promoting pseudoscience, which could have real consequences, like patients avoiding proven treatments. That's a legitimate concern for him.\n\nBut on the flip side, is it fair to end a 10-year relationship over this? The author feels bad because he loves her deeply. However, if their fundamental beliefs about important issues like medicine are incompatible, it might lead to ongoing conflict. The breakup might be a difficult but necessary decision for his own values and peace of mind.\n\nAlso, the financial burden is a factor. Supporting someone through a 200k ND program is a huge commitment. If the author isn't willing to take on that debt for a career he disagrees with, that's a personal boundary he's setting. While others might say it's not his problem, he's responsible for his own financial decisions.\n\nThe girlfriend's sister is an ND, so the family might support this path. But the author can't support it, which is his choice. Relationships are about mutual respect and acceptance. If one partner can't accept the other's core beliefs, even if those beliefs are controversial, that's a problem.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is being overly rigid. Maybe he could have supported her while maintaining his own views. But if her career's foundation is based on pseudoscience that he finds dangerous, it's a deal-breaker for him.\n\nIn conclusion, while the breakup is painful, the author isn't in the wrong because he's making a decision based on his values and concerns for both his partner's future and patients' well-being. It's a tough call, but he's not obligated to support a career he fundamentally disagrees with, especially with financial implications.\n"
