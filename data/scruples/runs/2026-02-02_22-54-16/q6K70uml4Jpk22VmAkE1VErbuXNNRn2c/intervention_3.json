Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and believes in pseudoscience. The author feels conflicted because he loves her but can't support her career path due to their differing views on medicine and the financial burden.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The breakup is based on fundamental differences in life goals and scientific beliefs. The author values evidence-based medicine and is concerned about his girlfriend's commitment to practices he sees as pseudoscientific, which could affect their future, including financial stability and ethical concerns.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, breaking up over core values isn't uncommon. If two people can't reconcile their fundamental disagreements, it might be unsustainable. The author mentions their visions for the future are incompatible. The financial aspect is a practical concern too\u2014$200k in debt is a big commitment, and the author might not be willing to shoulder that. \n\nHowever, the emotional aspect is important. The author is upset because he feels he's ending a 10-year relationship over material issues. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. The key here is whether the reasons for the breakup are justified. \n\nThe girlfriend's career choice is a personal decision, and while her beliefs might be controversial, unless she's harming anyone, it's her right to pursue it. The author's concern about her providing ineffective treatments could be a valid ethical issue, but that's a judgment call. However, the decision to end a relationship over this is subjective. \n\nIn terms of the options: AITA questions often look for whether the person acted unreasonably. The author isn't attacking her personally but is making a decision based on their incompatible futures. On the other hand, he's dismissing her career choice based on his beliefs, which could be seen as judgmental. \n\nBut given that the user says the author is not in the wrong, and considering that relationships require mutual compatibility, the author's decision might be seen as his right to prioritize his values. The answer here is likely B (Not in the wrong) because the breakup is based on irreconcilable differences rather than something malicious. The financial concerns are also a valid aspect to consider in a long-term partnership.\n"
