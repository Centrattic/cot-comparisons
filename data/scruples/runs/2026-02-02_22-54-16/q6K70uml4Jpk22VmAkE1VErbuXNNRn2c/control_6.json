Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is he broke up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor, and he has issues with her beliefs in pseudoscience like homeopathy and the idea that vaccinations cause autism. He also mentions financial concerns about the ND school's tuition.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons behind his decision. He feels like love shouldn't be about money or life views, but his vision for the future doesn't align with hers. He's worried about her using pseudoscientific methods, especially with cancer patients, which could be dangerous. On the other hand, he acknowledges that alternative medicine can have a place but draws the line at abandoning modern medicine.\n\nThe financial aspect is a big part too. He's not willing to take on $200k in debt for her education. His friends and family say it shouldn't matter, but he feels conflicted. He's hurting and regrets making the money issue the reason for the breakup.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Relationships require mutual respect and compatibility. If her beliefs directly contradict his, especially on health matters that could affect others (like cancer treatments), he might see that as a deal-breaker. However, ending a 10-year relationship over this might be seen as extreme if he initially thought it shouldn't matter. Also, the financial burden is a valid concern, but using that as the catalyst could be seen as selfish if he's not willing to support her in her chosen path despite his disagreements.\n\nBut then again, if her career involves promoting practices that could harm others, he has ethical concerns. It's a tough balance between respecting her choices and his own values. The key points are whether his reasons are justified (health safety vs. personal beliefs) and if breaking up over this was the right decision. \n\nI think there's a gray area here. While his concerns about pseudoscience are valid, using financial support as the main reason might not be fair. However, if he genuinely can't reconcile their differing views on medicine, maybe it's not the wrong decision. But the way he frames it, he feels conflicted, so maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. Alternatively, maybe he's being overly controlling by not supporting her education despite respecting her passion. \n\nHmm. I'm torn. On one hand, he's standing by his values; on the other, he's causing a breakup over something he thought shouldn't matter. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because people have the right to make relationship decisions based on their values, even if others disagree. But others might say he's wrong to prioritize his views over her dreams and their love. Given the context, I think the community might lean towards B, as he's making a difficult choice based on his principles, even if it's painful.\n"
