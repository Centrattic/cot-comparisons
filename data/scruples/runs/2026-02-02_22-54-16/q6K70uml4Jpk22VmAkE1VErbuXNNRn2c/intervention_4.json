Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) with certain beliefs.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the story. The author and his girlfriend have been in a 10-year relationship. She's set on attending ND school, which the author has issues with. He mentions her beliefs in pseudoscience like homeopathy and the discredited link between vaccines and autism. He's concerned about her approach to medicine, especially regarding cancer patients, fearing she might rely on placebo effects instead of modern medicine. He also brings up financial issues, like the $200k debt for her education, which he feels he'd have to support. The breakup was prompted by these disagreements, and he's feeling guilty because he thinks love shouldn't be about money or life views, but he can't reconcile their differing visions for the future.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants opinions. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author is ending a long-term relationship over fundamental differences in values and beliefs. He's not in agreement with her career choice and its implications. He's concerned about patient safety, especially in serious cases like cancer, which is a valid point. His financial concerns are also real; supporting such a costly education might be a significant burden. He might feel that their incompatible views on medicine make a future together impossible.\n\nOn the other hand, the breakup is based on her career and beliefs, which are part of her identity. The author is dismissing her career path as pseudoscience, but she might see it as a legitimate and important field. Ending a relationship over such disagreements can be seen as invalidating her choices and not respecting her autonomy. Also, using financial concerns as a reason might be a way to avoid deeper issues if they can't find common ground. However, if the author genuinely can't support her decisions and sees it as a deal-breaker for their future, that's something he has to consider.\n\nThe author's guilt suggests he feels conflicted. He acknowledges that love should transcend material issues but can't get past his concerns. It's possible that the breakup is more about incompatibility in core values rather than just money or school. The key question is whether it's reasonable for him to base such a decision on these differences.\n\nIn relationships, partners often face differences in values, careers, and beliefs. The ability to navigate these differences is crucial. If the author believes that her career's potential harm to patients (like giving up modern medicine for pseudoscience) is a deal-breaker, that's his personal boundary. However, others might argue that he's overstepping if her career is a matter of personal choice and not directly harmful in their shared life. The line between respecting her choices and being concerned about patient safety is thin here.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's decision is based on his values and concerns. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether the decision was made in bad faith or as a last resort after trying to reconcile differences. The story doesn't mention attempts to find common ground, which might be a point in his favor. But ending a long-term relationship over such issues isn't inherently wrong if they're fundamental to his happiness and integrity.\n"
