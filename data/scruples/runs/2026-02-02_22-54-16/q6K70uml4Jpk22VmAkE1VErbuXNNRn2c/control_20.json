Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and holds beliefs that the author considers pseudoscientific.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author broke up with his girlfriend over her career choice and beliefs regarding alternative medicine. He mentions issues like pseudoscience, financial burden of ND school, and differing views on medical practices. He feels conflicted because he loves her but can't support her path.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The key points are: \n\n1. **Free Choice in Relationships**: Should someone's career choice affect the relationship? Relationships require mutual respect. If one partner's career is a deal-breaker due to personal values, is that valid?\n\n2. **Beliefs and Health Practices**: Disagreeing with her views on pseudoscience (like vaccines causing autism) might be a red flag. If he's concerned about her future patients' health, that's a valid concern. However, he acknowledges NDs have a place in complementary roles. Is it his place to judge her career choice?\n\n3. **Financial Burden**: The cost of ND school and his unwillingness to support her financially could be a factor. But is financial support a requirement in a relationship? It depends on their circumstances and discussions prior.\n\n4. **Communication**: They had an argument leading to the breakup. Did he communicate his concerns effectively? If they tried to resolve it without success, maybe it's a shared issue.\n\n5. **Respect for Autonomy**: Everyone has the right to pursue their career. If his rejection is based on her beliefs rather than her as a person, is that fair?\n\n6. **Ethical Considerations**: If her career could harm others (e.g., advising against vaccines), is that a valid reason to distance? But he also admits she's providing a placebo at worst, which isn't illegal. However, medical malpractice is a different issue. If she's not practicing medicine but offering complementary care, maybe the concern is overstated.\n\n7. **Emotional Impact**: He's hurting, but does that justify the breakup? Both parties might feel wronged.\n\nIn relationships, differing values can lead to breakups. If the author's values (scientific rigor) are fundamentally incompatible with her career path, he might not be in the wrong. However, if he's dismissing her choices without understanding or respecting her perspective, he might share the blame. The financial aspect could be a valid concern if they discussed it and couldn't find a middle ground.\n\nBut, in many relationships, supporting each other's career is essential unless it's ethically wrong. Naturopathy isn't illegal, and while he disagrees with her views, unless she's practicing medicine without proper license, it's her choice. If his love is conditional on her not pursuing this path, maybe he is in the wrong for not accepting her as she is.\n\nYet, there's a line between respecting her career and respecting her beliefs. If he can't tolerate her pseudoscientific views, that's a deeper issue. However, love can sometimes mean accepting differences. His focus on financial support and their differing visions for the future might make the breakup understandable.\n\nOverall, this is a tough call. If the breakup was due to incompatible values and they couldn't reconcile, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he didn't try to find a solution or understand her perspective, he could share the blame. The answer might be a nuanced 'B' (not in the wrong) because their values are fundamentally conflicting, and relationships require mutual compatibility.\n"
