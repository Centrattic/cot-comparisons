Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend because she's becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and believes in pseudoscience like homeopathy and the idea that vaccines cause autism. The author feels conflicted because he loves her but can't support her career path due to the pseudoscience involved and the financial burden of her school debt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main reasons the breakup happened are the differing views on alternative medicine and the financial aspect. The author is against pseudoscience and doesn't want to support a career he views as unscientific. The girlfriend is committed to her path, including beliefs that are scientifically discredited.\n\nIn relationships, compatibility in core values is important. If two people can't agree on fundamental issues, it can lead to significant problems. The author's concern about pseudoscience might be a deal-breaker for him, especially if he's worried about her future practice potentially harming patients. The financial burden is another practical concern; supporting a $200k debt for a degree he doesn't value might be a strain.\n\nHowever, the author does acknowledge that love shouldn't be about money or life views, which shows he's aware that his reasons might be materialistic. He also feels guilty, which suggests he's conflicted. The question is whether his reasons are valid enough to justify the breakup.\n\nOn one hand, respecting someone's career choice is important. If the girlfriend is passionate about ND and it's her right to pursue it, even if he disagrees, maybe the author should have found a way to support her or accept the differences. On the other hand, if the author's values about science and medical ethics are a core part of his identity, and he can't reconcile that with her career, it might be a legitimate reason to end the relationship. The financial aspect is a practical issue that adds to the incompatibility.\n\nThe fact that the author's friends and family say it shouldn't matter might indicate that others don't see the pseudoscience as a major issue. But if the author genuinely feels he can't support her career due to ethical concerns, that's his personal boundary. Relationships require mutual respect, but also mutual willingness to accept each other's differences. If the author can't do that, ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong, though it's painful.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong because he's acting based on his values and the incompatibility in their life goals. However, it's a tough call because relationships often require compromise. But since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, the answer would be B.\n"
