Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND). Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the main issues are the girlfriend's belief in pseudoscience, like vaccinations causing autism and homeopathy, which are debunked by science. The author also brings up financial concerns about her ND school debt, which is around $200k. He's feeling guilty because he thought love shouldn't be about money or differing views, but he couldn't reconcile their different visions for the future.\n\nSo, the core of the problem here is conflicting values. The author values evidence-based medicine and is concerned about the potential harm from pseudoscience, especially in treating serious conditions like cancer. On the other hand, the girlfriend is committed to naturopathy, which the author sees as promoting unproven or harmful practices. The financial aspect adds another layer, as he's not willing to take on that debt to support her education.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. In relationships, people do break up over significant differences in values or goals. If one partner's career path conflicts with the other's core beliefs, especially when it comes to health practices that could affect others, that can be a deal-breaker. The author's concern about pseudoscience leading to harm is valid from a public health perspective. He's not just being judgmental; he's worried about real-world consequences if the ND practices in a way that delays or replaces necessary medical treatment.\n\nThe financial argument is also a practical concern. Supporting a $200k debt is a huge financial commitment, and if the author isn't willing to take that on, it's understandable as a reason to end the relationship. However, the way he framed the breakup, focusing on money rather than the pseudoscience aspect, might make him feel guilty, but the underlying reasons are still about incompatible values.\n\nOn the flip side, the girlfriend might feel that her career choice is personal and shouldn't affect their relationship. But if the author can't support her career without compromising his own beliefs, that's a valid issue. The key here is whether the breakup is based on genuine incompatibility or if the author is overstepping. Since the author tried to communicate his concerns and they couldn't resolve the differences, breaking up isn't necessarily wrong. People have the right to leave relationships where core values clash, especially when it affects their future together.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). The author made a difficult decision based on incompatible values and practical concerns, which is a valid reason for a breakup.\n"
