Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author broke up with their girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and believes in some pseudoscientific stuff like homeopathy and the idea that vaccines cause autism. The author is concerned about her views conflicting with modern medicine and the financial burden of her education. They feel guilty because they thought love shouldn't be about money or beliefs, but their differences led to the breakup.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is standing up for their values regarding science and medicine. They might feel that compromising on such important beliefs could lead to harmful practices in the future. On the other hand, breaking up over this might seem extreme. The girlfriend has a right to pursue her career, even if the author disagrees. The financial aspect is also a factor\u2014supporting her through a $200k debt is a big commitment. But is it fair to end a 10-year relationship over that?\n\nThe author's friends and family say it shouldn't matter, which could indicate that the issue is more about personal values than objective right or wrong. The girlfriend's sister is an ND, so there's a family tradition here. The author is worried about patients potentially missing out on proper medical care if the girlfriend relies on pseudoscience. That's a valid concern about public health, but it's also a personal choice.\n\nIn relationships, differences in core values can cause issues. Here, the conflict is between scientific evidence and alternative medicine. The author might feel that this is a fundamental incompatibility. However, is it the author's place to dictate her career and beliefs? The girlfriend is making her own choices, even if they clash with the author's views. The author's decision was based on their inability to accept those choices, which could be seen as a personal decision rather than being in the wrong.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. They're prioritizing their values and financial stability, but breaking up over this might be seen as using material concerns as an excuse. However, if the beliefs are a deal-breaker, maybe it's not wrong. But the guilt they feel suggests they're questioning their decision. The answer might depend on whether one views the disagreement as a legitimate incompatibility or an overreaction to differing opinions. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given that they tried to rationalize their decision, the answer could be B (Not in the wrong) because it's a personal choice based on their values, even if others disagree.\n"
