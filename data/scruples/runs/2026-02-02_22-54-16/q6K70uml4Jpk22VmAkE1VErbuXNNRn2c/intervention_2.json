Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and holds pseudoscientific beliefs like linking vaccines to autism. The author feels conflicted because he loves her but can't support her career path and beliefs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue here. The author is ending the relationship due to disagreements over career choices and scientific views. Love and relationships often have to navigate differences, but when do those differences become deal-breakers? The author mentions the financial burden of her ND school, which he would support, but more importantly, he can't condone her field's reliance on pseudoscience, especially in a context where patients' lives are at stake (like cancer patients).\n\nThe girlfriend is set on this path and believes in practices that the author sees as harmful if taken over modern medicine. The author's concern isn't just about ideology; it's about potential real-world consequences. He's worried that her approach might lead patients to rely on ineffective treatments instead of evidence-based medicine. That's a serious ethical concern, especially in healthcare.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is criticized for prioritizing material aspects (money, career) over love. The question is whether his decision is justified. The key here is whether the beliefs and career choice of the girlfriend pose a risk that the author can't reconcile, especially when it comes to patient safety. If he believes she's endangering patients, that's a significant issue. However, others might argue that personal beliefs shouldn't dictate a relationship unless directly harmful.\n\nThe author also feels guilty for using money as a reason. But the financial aspect is tied to the career choice. Supporting someone through ND school is a big commitment, and he might not be able to support a career he fundamentally disagrees with. The deeper issue is conflicting worldviews that affect future plans and values.\n\nIn relationships, major differences in core values can be deal-breakers. If both partners can't compromise or find a middle ground, it's natural for the relationship to end. The author's decision isn't just about love versus money; it's about irreconcilable differences in values and ethical concerns. While love is important, it's also valid for individuals to prioritize their beliefs and the potential consequences of those beliefs in a partnership.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's making a tough choice based on his convictions and concerns about the implications of her career. However, it's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points. The answer would hinge on whether the author's reasons are justified given the potential risks of the girlfriend's career path and beliefs.\n"
