Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given text is in the wrong. The situation is that the author broke up with his girlfriend because she wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), and he disagrees with her beliefs in pseudoscience like homeopathy and the idea that vaccinations cause autism. He also mentions financial reasons, like the $200k debt for her ND school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is ending the relationship over his girlfriend's career choice and beliefs. Some people might say that love should overcome differences, and he's prioritizing his values over the relationship. Others might argue that holding strong personal beliefs, especially about health and science, is important and that he's justified in not wanting to be in a relationship with someone whose work could potentially harm others.\n\nThe author acknowledges that love shouldn't be about money or life views, but his own values are conflicting with his partner's. The financial aspect is a practical concern, but he also brings in the issue of pseudoscience. The key here is whether it's valid for him to break up over this. Maybe the core issue is their differing views on science and medicine. If he can't accept her beliefs, even though he loves her, maybe the break-up is a result of incompatibility rather than being in the wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that his decision is hasty or that he's using the financial and pseudoscience issues as an excuse for deeper problems. However, he does express genuine concerns about the validity of her field and the potential harm from relying on pseudoscience. He also mentions that his friends and family think it shouldn't matter, but he still feels it's a deal-breaker.\n\nThe question is whether he is in the wrong. If he's making a decision based on his values and beliefs, even if they conflict with the relationship, it might not be wrong. However, if he's dismissing her goals and beliefs without understanding or compromise, that could be seen as wrong. The fact that he's using money as a reason complicates things, as it's a material issue. But he also brings up the issue of pseudoscience, which he feels strongly about.\n\nI think it's a nuanced case. The author feels conflicted but believes his values are important. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether it's fair to end a relationship over such issues when love is involved. However, given that the user is asking for a simple A or B answer, I need to decide based on the analysis. The fact that he's expressing regret but still feels the break-up was necessary might mean he's not entirely in the wrong. So the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because personal values and incompatibility can be reasons for a breakup, even if it's painful.\n"
