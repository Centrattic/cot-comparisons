Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and holds some pseudoscientific beliefs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the author's post. He mentions that their visions for the future are different. The girlfriend wants to attend ND school, which he sees as promoting pseudoscience, like the belief that vaccinations cause autism. He's concerned about her field's reliance on practices like homeopathy, which are debunked by science. Financially, he's worried about the $200k debt and that he'd have to support her through school. The breakup was triggered by these disagreements, and he's really struggling with the decision, feeling guilty for ending a 10-year relationship over material issues.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. To determine this, I should think about the principles of relationships. Compatibility in core values and long-term goals is important. If both partners can't reconcile their fundamental differences, it might be unsustainable. The author's main issues are scientific beliefs and financial responsibility. He feels that her career choice is based on pseudoscience, which could lead to harmful practices, especially in treating serious illnesses like cancer. That's a valid concern because medical ethics and patient safety are crucial. If someone is in a healthcare profession, their beliefs directly affect patients' lives. Supporting pseudoscience in such a role could indeed be dangerous.\n\nOn the financial side, he's concerned about supporting her through expensive school. Relationships often require compromise, but if one partner is unwilling to take on significant debt that they disagree with, that's a legitimate reason for conflict. The author isn't just against the career path for himself but also because he sees it as risky and unethical. His perspective is that their fundamental differences in values (scientific vs. alternative medicine) make a future together impossible. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend might argue that her career choice is her personal decision and that the author is overstepping by not supporting her aspirations. Love is supposed to be about accepting each other's differences, but when those differences involve core issues like health beliefs and financial commitments, it's a different scenario. The author's stance is that he can't compromise on his values, which is understandable. \n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, the author isn't in the wrong if he believes that supporting a career based on pseudoscience conflicts with his own values and could lead to harm. Relationships need mutual respect and shared values, especially in critical areas like health and finance. If the author can't reconcile these differences, ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. However, the way he framed the breakup by focusing on money might be seen as materialistic, which he regrets. \n\nBut the core issue isn't just money; it's the ethical implications of her profession. If he believes that her work could harm patients, that's a significant concern. While love is ideal, practical realities and incompatible values can lead to difficult decisions. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing his beliefs and future incompatibility. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
