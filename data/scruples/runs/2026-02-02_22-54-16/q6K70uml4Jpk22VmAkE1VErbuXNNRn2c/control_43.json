Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the given text is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and believes in some pseudoscience. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is upset because they ended a 10-year relationship over this. His main issues are her belief in pseudoscience (like vaccines causing autism, homeopathy) and the financial burden of her ND school. He feels guilty because he thinks love shouldn't be about money or views, but he couldn't reconcile their differing values.\n\nNow, the question is: is he in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. On one hand, breaking up over something like this might seem harsh, especially if the relationship was long-term. The girlfriend's career choice and beliefs could be seen as her personal choice, and the author might be overstepping by judging her career path, especially if it's not directly affecting him. Also, financial support for her education could be a valid concern, but maybe there are other ways to handle that without ending the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned about pseudoscience, which he sees as potentially harmful. If he can't support her in a field he believes is based on false premises, that might be a deal-breaker for him. Also, the debt is significant, and he might feel that taking on that financial responsibility is unreasonable. However, is that a fair reason to end a relationship? Relationships often involve compromises, and maybe he should have addressed these issues earlier rather than waiting until the end.\n\nThe girlfriend's sister graduated from the same school, and the author feels that at best it's a placebo, at worst dangerous. That's a strong opinion, but does that justify ending a relationship? It might depend on how much this affects their compatibility. If they can't agree on basic scientific views, which are important to both, maybe it's a fundamental incompatibility. However, the author also acknowledges that NDs have a place as an alternative, so maybe his stance is more about the pseudoscience than the career itself.\n\nHe also mentions that friends and family said it shouldn't matter, but he still feels it does. That shows internal conflict. The question is whether his reasons are valid. If their core values about science and medicine are clashing to the point where he can't support her career, maybe it's a legitimate reason. But is it the right way to handle it? Maybe there's a middle ground, like discussing these issues earlier or seeking couples' counseling.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the breakup is because of fundamental disagreements over values that affect their future together, then maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if he's dismissing her career choice without understanding or respecting her reasons, then he might be. The financial aspect is also a practical concern, but using it as the main reason after a long relationship could be seen as materialistic, which he himself acknowledges.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, the answer might depend on whether the breakup was based on valid, non-negotiable issues or if he's overreacting to differences that could have been managed. The key points are the pseudoscience beliefs and financial burden. If those are deal-breakers for him and he's honest about his concerns, then maybe he's not wrong. But if he's using them as excuses to avoid deeper issues, he might be.\n"
