Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend because she wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), and he disagrees with her views on pseudoscience like homeopathy and thinks she's against vaccinations. He's feeling guilty because he thinks love shouldn't be about money or beliefs, but he still ended the relationship over these issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's main reasons are about conflicting views on science and the financial burden of ND school. He feels guilty because he used money as a reason, but his deeper issue is with her beliefs in pseudoscience. The breakup was after a 10-year relationship, which is a long time, so there's a lot of emotional weight here.\n\nNow, in terms of being in the wrong, it's about whether his reasons for breaking up are valid. On one hand, values and beliefs can be important in a relationship. If someone is against core values, like the importance of scientific medicine, that could be a deal-breaker, especially if it might affect health decisions for themselves or others. On the other hand, ending a long-term relationship over these issues might be seen as harsh, especially if the girlfriend is committed to her path and doesn't see it as problematic.\n\nThe author mentions that he respects NDs as an alternative but can't support pseudoscience. However, his girlfriend is going into a field that he considers dangerous because it relies on things like homeopathy, which he thinks are unproven. There's also the financial aspect, but he acknowledges friends and family say that shouldn't matter. His guilt suggests he's conflicted.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, the decision to break up is personal. If the beliefs go against his core values to the point of incompatibility, then he might not be wrong. However, if the real issue is not just her beliefs but the financial burden he can't support, maybe that's more about his own inability to handle the costs rather than her beliefs. Also, using money as the main argument in the breakup might have overshadowed the actual reasons, making the breakup feel more materialistic than about values.\n\nAnother angle: if he truly loved her, could he have tried to find a compromise? Maybe not, if he can't reconcile their views. But love is supposed to involve acceptance, so if he can't accept her career choice, does that mean he wasn't ready for the relationship's future? That could imply he's in the wrong for not managing his own values or for not addressing the issues earlier.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of pseudoscience leading to potential harm. If her career could endanger others, he might feel justified in his stance. But it's her choice, and unless she's actively harming people, it's her path. The line between personal belief and professional ethics is blurry here.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer might hinge on whether the author's reasons are valid as core incompatibilities or if he's using them as an excuse. Since the situation is complex and both sides have valid points, but the author is feeling guilty and the breakup was over material issues, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he couldn't accept her for who she is, which is a fundamental aspect of a relationship. But some might argue B (not in the wrong) if the values are fundamentally irreconcilable. Given the context and the emphasis on love vs. materialism, leaning towards A.\n"
