Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user broke up with his girlfriend because she's pursuing a career as a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), which he views as pseudoscientific. He mentions she believes in things like vaccinations causing autism and homeopathy, which are debunked. He feels their visions for the future are incompatible. He also brought up financial concerns about her $200k student debt for ND school. He's feeling guilty because he thinks love shouldn't be about money or opinions, but he ended the 10-year relationship over this.\n\nFirst, I should consider whether the author is justified in breaking up. Relationships can end due to irreconcilable differences in values or life goals. The key points here are the beliefs about medicine and financial implications. The girlfriend is going into a field he views as promoting pseudoscience, which he finds harmful. On the other hand, she might see her field as valid alternative medicine.\n\nThe author's argument is that while alternative medicine can have a place, he can't support practices that abandon modern medicine, especially when it could lead to harm (like not seeing an MD). He also brought up financial support, which is a practical concern. The girlfriend's sister already has the ND degree, so this isn't an isolated case.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong for breaking up? Well, in relationships, differing values can lead to breakups. If one partner's career choice is based on beliefs the other finds unethical or dangerous, that's a significant issue. Especially if the partner is going into a field that the author believes could endanger others (like cancer patients relying on NDs instead of MDs). The financial aspect is also a real concern, as supporting a $200k debt is a big commitment.\n\nBut does that make him the wrong one? The question is whether breaking up over this is justified. The author is not wrong if the relationship couldn't survive these differences. However, the way he handled it might be criticized if it was abrupt or if he focused on the money as the main point, which he did. But given the severity of the beliefs he's against, maybe he's justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's choice is her right, and he might have chosen to leave because he couldn't compromise. The ethical issue is whether his reasons are valid. Since the ND field is controversial and he genuinely believes it's harmful, his decision could be seen as protecting his values. But others might argue that personal beliefs about medicine shouldn't dictate a breakup, especially if both parties aren't causing direct harm.\n\nThe answer might depend on societal views. Some might say he's overstepping by judging her career choice, while others support his stance on pseudoscience. The fact that he's feeling guilty suggests internal conflict, but guilt doesn't necessarily mean he's in the wrong. The key is whether his reasons are reasonable. Since ND is a licensed field in some places, but still controversial, the line between alternative and pseudoscientific is blurry. His financial concern is valid, but it's also a matter of personal choice to take on that debt.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's decision might be seen as justifiable because the differences are fundamental and potentially harmful. However, the fact that he focused on money as the breaking point could be seen as a materialistic reason, which he himself acknowledges. But if the core issue is the pseudoscience, then the financial aspect is part of the broader issue of supporting her career. Therefore, he's not in the wrong because the values conflict is significant enough to end the relationship.\n"
