Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this breakup story is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author broke up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), which he associates with pseudoscience like homeopathy and the belief that vaccines cause autism. He mentions that while he understands some issues with over-prescription in modern medicine, he can't support alternative medicine that ignores science. The main points he raises are about her beliefs conflicting with his trust in modern medicine and financial concerns about her $200k debt for ND school.\n\nHe feels guilty because he thinks love shouldn't be about money or life views, but their differing visions for the future led to the breakup. He's struggling with whether he made the right decision, especially since friends and family say it shouldn't matter. He's hurting because a 10-year relationship ended over something he sees as materialistic.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Relationship issues are complex, but the key here is whether his reasons for breaking up are valid. He's standing by his beliefs about science and medicine, which are important values for him. However, he's choosing to end the relationship because of her career and beliefs, which she clearly believes in. \n\nOn one hand, it's his right to end a relationship if their core values clash irreconcilably. If he can't support her career and her beliefs, and she can't compromise, then the breakup might be a result of incompatible values. On the other hand, if he's dismissing her life choices and career without understanding or respect, that could be seen as the wrong approach. \n\nThe financial aspect is a practical concern, but he's framing it as a deal-breaker. However, relationships often involve supporting each other's goals, even costly ones. If he's against her career path fundamentally, the financial burden is a symptom of a deeper issue. \n\nHe also criticizes her field for potentially harming patients by promoting pseudoscience. That's a serious concern if he believes she might neglect conventional treatments. But if she's practicing within regulations and not outright opposing modern medicine, maybe his fears are exaggerated. \n\nThe question is whether his reasons are justified. If the core issue is a genuine incompatibility in values (like trust in science vs. alternative medicine), then it's a matter of personal values. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing his beliefs. However, if he's being judgmental or dismissive without understanding her perspective, that's problematic. \n\nConsidering that the user is asking for a binary answer (A or B), and given the nuances, the author's decision is based on his values and concerns. While it's painful, if the relationship couldn't reconcile these differences, he isn't in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
