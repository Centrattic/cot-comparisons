Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong after breaking up with their girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and holds pseudoscientific beliefs. The author feels conflicted because they love their girlfriend but can't support her career choice due to ideological differences and financial concerns.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given for the breakup. The main points are her belief in pseudoscience (like vaccines causing autism, homeopathy), her career choice leading to significant debt, and his inability to support her through it. The author feels guilty because they think love shouldn't be about money or views on life, but their values clash.\n\nIn relationships, differing values can be a valid reason to break up. If one partner's career is based on beliefs the other finds harmful or unscientific, that's a serious conflict. The author is concerned that her career might lead to harm if patients rely on ND instead of medical doctors (MDs), especially in critical cases like cancer. That's a valid safety concern.\n\nHowever, the financial aspect is also a factor. Supporting a $200k debt for a 4-year ND degree might be a financial burden. But the author's friends and family say it shouldn't matter, which adds another layer. The author is torn between their feelings and their principles.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, it's a personal decision. People break up for various reasons, including incompatible values. If the author believes that their partner's career could lead to harm, they might feel they can't live with that. However, is it fair to judge someone's career choice based on personal beliefs? The girlfriend's sister is an ND, so maybe the family is supportive. The author might be projecting their own views onto the girlfriend's decisions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is upfront about their concerns. They tried to work through the issues but couldn't reconcile their differences. In that case, ending the relationship because of irreconcilable differences isn't necessarily wrong. But the author's guilt suggests they feel conflicted. The key is whether the breakup was based on genuine incompatibility or if the author is overstepping by opposing someone's career and beliefs.\n\nNaturopathy is a controversial field. Some people find value in it, while others see it as pseudoscience. The author's stance is that NDs have a place as alternatives, but they can't support a career that they think might endanger patients. If the girlfriend is set on this path despite the author's concerns, it's a significant clash. The author might have a valid reason to step back if they can't support her decisions, especially regarding potential harm to patients. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't wrong if they believe they can't support a career that conflicts with their values to that degree. However, using financial support as a reason might be seen as materialistic, which the author themselves criticizes. The breakup is a personal choice, and while the author feels guilty, it's not inherently wrong if the relationship became unsustainable due to these differences.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They made a tough decision based on their values and concerns, even though they feel conflicted. The answer would be B (No).\n"
