Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person broke up with their girlfriend because she wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), and they disagree with her beliefs in pseudoscience like homeopathy and the idea that vaccines cause autism. The author feels conflicted because they love her but can't accept her career choice and beliefs, especially the financial aspect and the potential harm from relying on alternative medicine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons for the breakup. The author is concerned about the significant student debt (around $200k) and the fact that the ND path conflicts with their own views on science and medicine. They also mention that they can't support her career because it's based on pseudoscience, which they think could be harmful, especially to cancer patients. \n\nOn one hand, love and relationships are supposed to be about mutual respect and support. Ending a long-term relationship over such a deeply personal and career-related choice might seem harsh. The girlfriend's choice to pursue a specific career path, even if you disagree, is a personal decision. The author is making a judgment about her profession and beliefs, which could be seen as undermining her values and goals. The financial aspect is also a practical concern, but the author admits that their friends and family say it shouldn't matter, which adds to their internal conflict.\n\nHowever, the author also mentions that they can't reconcile their belief in science with the girlfriend's opposing views. If the girlfriend is committed to pseudoscientific practices that the author finds harmful, especially in a medical context, this could be a deal-breaker for them. The author's concern about potential harm to patients (like not seeking proper medical treatment) is a valid ethical concern, even if it's based on their own values.\n\nThe key points here are whether the breakup was based on valid, shared values or on the author's inability to accept the other person's beliefs. The author is in a dilemma between love and their principles. However, using the career choice and beliefs as the primary reason for the breakup, especially after a 10-year relationship, might indicate that the author prioritized their own values over the relationship. The question is whether that's justifiable or if it's wrong to end a relationship over such differences.\n\nIn relationships, significant disagreements can lead to breakups, especially if core values are incompatible. However, the author's decision to end it over financial and ideological differences related to a career choice might be seen as materialistic or dismissive of the partner's aspirations. The author feels conflicted, which suggests they recognize the moral ambiguity of their actions. The fact that they're questioning if they're in the wrong adds weight to the idea that they might be overemphasizing the material aspect and underestimating the importance of supporting their partner's choices despite disagreements.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the author is in the wrong because they ended a long-term relationship over differences in career and values that, while important, might not be deal-breakers in a committed relationship, especially when love and care are present. The focus on money and pseudoscience as the main issues could be materialistic, and the breakup might have been avoidable with more compromise or understanding."
