Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the breakup story is in the wrong. The situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), and he disagrees with her views on alternative medicine, like believing in pseudoscience such as homeopathy and the link between vaccines and autism. He also mentions the financial burden of her school debt and his concern about her future practice potentially harming patients.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral aspects here. Love and relationships often involve compromises, but there are also deal-breakers. The author is struggling with the fact that his values and beliefs about medicine clash with his partner's career choice. He feels conflicted because he loves her but can't support her path.\n\nOn one hand, it's valid for the author to have strong convictions about pseudoscience being harmful. If he believes that her career could lead to ineffective or dangerous practices, that's a real concern. The financial aspect is another point; taking on significant debt for a career that he doesn't support could be a heavy burden for a relationship. In relationships, especially long-term ones, financial expectations and support are crucial. If both partners aren't aligned on major life decisions, it can lead to serious issues.\n\nOn the other hand, breaking up over this might seem harsh, especially if he acknowledges that love shouldn't be about money or life views. The fact that they had a 10-year relationship and ended it over this suggests deep incompatibility. But is that enough to say he's in the wrong? Relationships require mutual respect and understanding. If he couldn't accept her life choices, maybe the breakup was inevitable. However, there's also the question of whether he should have tried to work through the conflict more, perhaps seeking counseling or finding a compromise.\n\nAnother angle is the ethical responsibility of the ND. If he believes her work could harm others, he might feel a duty to voice that, even if it leads to the breakup. However, that's a personal choice and might not be within his right to make for her. It's her life and career, so unless she's actively endangering others through her practice, it's more of a personal belief conflict.\n\nThe author's justification includes the financial aspect and his ethical concerns. If the relationship couldn't handle that, maybe it wasn't sustainable. But was the breakup the right decision? It's possible he's in the right to prioritize his values, but also in the wrong for not working through the issue. The question is subjective, but in terms of right and wrong, it's about whether the reasons for breaking up are justifiable.\n\nIn the end, the author feels conflicted and questions his decision, which is common in such situations. The key is whether the breakup was based on valid, non-negotiable issues. Since the core of the conflict is about fundamental beliefs and financial commitment, which are significant, it's hard to say he's outright in the wrong. However, some might argue that love should overcome such differences. But others might see his stance as protecting his principles and future well-being.\n"
