Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), which he associates with pseudoscience. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points in the scenario. The author mentions that his girlfriend is going into ND school, which he sees as promoting pseudoscience like homeopathy and denying the link between vaccinations and autism. He also brings up financial concerns about her $200k student debt and the idea that NDs might be providing a placebo effect, potentially harming patients by not using modern medicine.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels bad because he thought love shouldn't be about money or differing views. He's hurting over ending a 10-year relationship over this. The question is whether he's in the wrong for prioritizing his beliefs over love.\n\nI should think about the ethics of relationships. In a healthy relationship, differences in values and beliefs can lead to conflicts. But when those differences involve issues like pseudoscience in medical practice, which could have real-world consequences (like treating cancer patients), that's a significant concern. The author is worried that her profession might be harmful, which he might not be able to live with.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's choice to pursue ND is her personal and professional path. The author's objection is based on his scientific beliefs, but others might argue that it's not his place to dictate her career choices unless there's a direct conflict, like if she were to use harmful practices. The financial aspect is also a practical concern, but it's a material issue, which the author himself acknowledges as something he thought shouldn't matter.\n\nThe decision to break up over this shows a conflict between personal values and relationship values. While respecting differing views is important, there's a line when it comes to practices that could affect others' health. The author might be in the right if he believes he can't support a partner whose career could lead to harm. But others might say he's overstepping, as her career choice is hers, and the pseudoscience aspect is debatable.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer isn't straightforward. But since the user is asking for A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No), I need to decide. The author is prioritizing his beliefs about science and medicine over the relationship, which some might see as wrong because it's a personal choice and the relationship's emotional bond. Others might see it as justified because he can't support something he views as harmful. Given the potential impact of her work on patients, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the relationship was the priority, he might be. The answer likely depends on the weight given to differing values versus the relationship's importance.\n"
