Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user wants a simple answer, A or B, but I need to think through it first.\n\nThe situation is that the author broke up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a naturopathic doctor (ND). He's conflicted because he loves her but disagrees with her beliefs in pseudoscience like homeopathy and the link between vaccines and autism. He also mentions financial concerns about her $200k debt for school.\n\nFirst, I should consider the reasons for the breakup. Disagreement on core values or beliefs can be a valid reason for a breakup. If someone's career path and beliefs clash significantly with your own, especially if they affect important areas like health, it might be a deal-breaker. The author is worried that her profession could lead to harmful practices, like patients not seeking proper medical care. This could be a legitimate concern, as promoting pseudoscience can have real consequences, especially in health-related fields.\n\nBut love is supposed to be about accepting each other's flaws, right? However, the question is whether the author's reasons are valid. The financial aspect is a material concern, which he admits feels wrong to base a breakup on. Yet, he feels the philosophical differences about science and medicine are more significant. \n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend's choice of career is her own, and unless she's forcing him to adopt her beliefs or they're in a situation where his health is at risk, it might be his personal choice to not support her path. On the other hand, if he can't accept her beliefs and the potential risks associated with her profession, maybe it's a fundamental incompatibility.\n\nAlso, the author mentions his own nuanced view: he's okay with NDs as an alternative but disagrees with completely abandoning modern medicine. She, however, is \"dead set\" on her path, implying she might not compromise. That could lead to ongoing conflict, especially if they were to be in a relationship. The financial burden is another practical issue he brings up.\n\nBut is it right to end a 10-year relationship over this? Some might say yes if the core values are irreconcilable. Others might argue that love should overcome such differences. The author feels guilty because he's torn between his feelings and his beliefs. However, the key here is whether his actions were wrong. If he's being honest about his incompatibility and not tolerating beliefs he finds harmful, that's his choice. But if he's making a decision based on fear or misunderstanding of her profession without discussing solutions, maybe there's a problem.\n\nAlso, the fact that he discussed it with friends and family and they said it shouldn't matter might indicate societal pressure, but personal compatibility is subjective. Ultimately, whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether his reasons are valid and if he handled the breakup ethically. Since he's honest about his concerns and not being coercive, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's dismissing her career choice without understanding her motivations, perhaps he is. However, given the potential risks he mentions (like patients dying), his stance might be seen as protecting from harm, which could justify his decision.\n\nSo, I think the answer leans towards B\u2014author is not in the wrong\u2014because differing fundamental beliefs about health and science can be a valid reason for a breakup, especially when there's a risk of harm involved.\n"
