Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author broke up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), and he disagrees with some of the pseudoscientific beliefs she has, like linking vaccines to autism and believing in homeopathy. He also mentions financial concerns about her going into a school that costs $200k, which he would have to support her through.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue here. Is it about differing beliefs or about a specific issue like pseudoscience? The author states that love shouldn't be about money or views on life but about caring. However, he's breaking up over her career choice, which he sees as based on pseudoscience. He's worried that her future work might harm patients by relying on unproven methods instead of modern medicine.\n\nNow, in relationships, it's common for people to have values and deal-breakers. If one person's career choice involves practices that the other believes could be harmful, is that a valid reason to break up? The author is concerned about patient safety, especially in cancer cases, which is a serious matter. However, is it his place to dictate her career path, especially if she's passionate about it and sees it as helping people?\n\nAlso, there's the financial aspect. He's worried about supporting her through a costly program. Maybe they didn't have an open discussion about finances or the viability of her career choice. The fact that her sister graduated from the same school adds another layer\u2014maybe the author feels like she's following in her sister's path without questioning it.\n\nThe author feels bad because he's breaking up over material issues like school and money, but he also believes that his values are important. The question is whether his reasons for breaking up are justified. If the girlfriend is committed to a field he fundamentally disagrees with, especially when it comes to health practices, perhaps he can't support her or her career, which might lead to long-term conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, is it fair to end a 10-year relationship over this? The user mentions that friends and family say it shouldn't matter. But personal values can be a significant factor in relationships. If the author can't accept her career path, maybe he's not the best partner for her, and vice versa.\n\nHowever, the author's reasoning does have some problematic aspects. He's making assumptions about what an ND does, like giving up modern medicine. But NDs can work alongside conventional medicine. He might not have fully understood her approach, which could lead to misjudgment. Also, his focus on financial aspects might be a surface-level issue; the deeper issue is about conflicting values regarding science and medicine.\n\nIn summary, the author is conflicted between his values and his feelings. While his concerns about pseudoscience are valid, breaking up over them might be harsh. It's possible that communication could have resolved some of these issues. However, if the core values are irreconcilable, then maybe the breakup is justified. But the way he frames it\u2014focusing on money and school\u2014without addressing the deeper issues might make him seem in the wrong.\n"
