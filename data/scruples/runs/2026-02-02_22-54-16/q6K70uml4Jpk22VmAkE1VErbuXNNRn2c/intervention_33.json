Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her choice to become a Naturopathic Doctor. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the points.\n\nThe author mentions that the reason for the breakup is a fundamental difference in their views on medicine. He's concerned about her belief in pseudoscience like homeopathy and the idea that vaccines cause autism, which are scientifically disproven. He also brings up the financial aspect of her attending ND school, which would cost around $200k, and he feels he can't support that. The girlfriend is set on this path, working with cancer patients, which the author fears might lead to harmful outcomes if she relies on alternative medicine instead of modern practices.\n\nFirst, I should consider the core issue here: whether differing beliefs about medicine are a valid reason to end a relationship. The author argues that love shouldn't be about money or life views, but his own values are clashing with hers. On one hand, personal beliefs and values are crucial in relationships, and if they're incompatible, it can lead to conflicts. On the other hand, love and commitment might require compromise.\n\nThe author feels guilty because he's breaking up over material issues (money and career choice), which he thinks shouldn't matter. But he also believes that her career path is based on pseudoscience, which he finds dangerous. This raises the question of whether such disagreements are deal-breakers or if they can be navigated through communication and respect.\n\nFinancial concerns are a significant factor here. Supporting her through school is a big financial commitment, and if he's not willing to take on that debt, it's a practical issue. However, it's also possible that they could have found a way to manage the debt together, but the author might feel it's unsustainable given his views on her career.\n\nAnother angle is the potential ethical implications. If her career could lead to harmful practices (like relying on placebos for serious conditions), the author might feel a moral obligation to distance himself. But is it his place to judge her career choices? Relationships require mutual respect, so even if he disagrees, supporting her choice might be necessary unless there's a legal or ethical violation.\n\nThe author's friends and family told him it shouldn't matter, but he still feels it does. This suggests internal conflict. Maybe he values his own scientific views more than the relationship itself. But if love is supposed to be about caring, can he truly care if he doesn't support her path?\n\nThere's also the aspect of how they handled the argument. The main point was the money, which might have been a symptom of deeper issues. If communication broke down and they couldn't find common ground, then the breakup might be a result of unresolved conflicts rather than just one issue.\n\nI need to weigh the importance of personal values versus the commitment in a relationship. If the author can't accept her career and its implications, then maybe the breakup is a consequence of irreconcilable differences. However, is it fair to end a 10-year relationship over this? Some might argue that love should overcome such differences, while others might say that certain core values are non-negotiable.\n\nThe author's guilt is evident, which complicates things. He feels he's making the wrong decision, but his reasons are based on his beliefs. It's possible that he's prioritizing his principles over the relationship, which can be a valid choice, but also painful.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. But from an objective standpoint, whether he's in the wrong depends on whether disagreeing with her career path and its implications is a legitimate reason to end a relationship. Since relationships are built on mutual respect and shared values, if those values are fundamentally incompatible, ending it isn't necessarily wrong. However, the way he chose the money as the main point might have been a symptom of deeper issues, and he might have handled it differently.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer could be that he's not in the wrong (B) because personal values and ethical concerns can be valid reasons for a breakup, even if it's painful. However, others might argue that he's overstepping by not supporting her career choice, which could be a matter of perspective.\n"
