Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend because she's becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) is in the wrong. The situation is complicated, so I need to consider both sides.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they broke up over differing views on medicine. The girlfriend believes in alternative practices that the author sees as pseudoscience, like homeopathy and the discredited link between vaccines and autism. The author is concerned that her career choice could potentially harm patients by relying on unproven methods instead of modern medicine. They also mention the financial burden of her ND school, which they would have to support.\n\nOn the other hand, the author expresses love and regret, feeling that the breakup shouldn't be about money or career paths. They acknowledge that love should transcend such issues. The girlfriend's sister is already an ND, so this isn't a new or isolated choice in the family. The author is struggling with the idea that their decision was based on material concerns rather than emotional ones.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. In relationships, it's common for differences in values to cause conflict. However, the key here is whether the decision to break up was justified. The author's concern about pseudoscience leading to harm is a valid ethical concern, especially if the ND field promotes practices that can be dangerous. But love and relationships also involve compromise. If the author couldn't reconcile their differing views on such a fundamental issue, maybe the breakup isn't wrong. However, using financial reasons as the main argument might be a red flag, as they themselves admit it's a material issue that shouldn't matter. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's commitment to her career path is clear. If the author couldn't support her in this, maybe it was a breaking point. But is it the author's fault for not being able to accept her choices? Or is the girlfriend in the wrong for pursuing a path that others might see as harmful? It's a tough call. The author might feel they're standing up for scientific integrity, but relationships require mutual respect. If the author can't respect her choice, even if they disagree, then maybe the breakup is a result of incompatible values. However, the way the breakup was handled, focusing on money, might have been a mistake. \n\nIn the end, whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether their reasons are justified. If they truly believe that her career path is harmful and they can't support it, it's their choice. But the regret and feeling of being an \"asshat\" suggest internal conflict. The answer might be nuanced, but since the user wants a simple A or B, I need to decide. Given that the author is conflicted and acknowledges their own doubts, it's possible they're not entirely wrong. However, their actions might still be justified if they felt the values were irreconcilable. But since the question is about being in the wrong, maybe the answer is A (yes) because they broke up over something that ideally shouldn't matter, like career and beliefs. However, if the beliefs are harmful, then it's not wrong. This is tricky. Maybe the answer is B (no), because they have a right to their values and concerns about patient safety. But others might say it's wrong to end a relationship over such issues. The community might split, but based on the information, the author's concerns are about safety and ethics, which could be valid. Therefore, the answer might be B (no), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
