Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her pursuing a naturopathic doctor (ND) program. The situation is complex, so I need to consider different angles.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the main reasons for the breakup are her belief in pseudoscience like homeopathy and vaccinations leading to autism, which are scientifically disproven. He also brings up financial concerns about her 200k debt for the ND school. He feels conflicted because he loves her but can't support her career path.\n\nOn one hand, love and relationships can be based on shared values and future goals. If someone's career or beliefs fundamentally clash with another's, it might lead to incompatibility. The author's concern about pseudoscience and the potential harm of relying on alternative medicine instead of evidence-based practices could be a valid personal boundary. If he can't accept her career choice because he believes it's ineffective or dangerous, that's a significant issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is criticized for focusing on material concerns like money and her field of study. The girlfriend's choice to become an ND is her personal decision, and the author might be projecting his fears onto her. The breakup over financial support for her education could be seen as him placing an undue burden on her to change her path, which might not be fair. Also, the initial reasons given about pseudoscience might be more about differing values, but whether that's a deal-breaker is subjective.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the relationship was built on mutual respect and understanding, but they fundamentally disagree on core issues like science and medicine, maybe it's reasonable to part ways. However, if the author didn't try to find common ground or compromise, and instead prioritized his own beliefs over her aspirations, he might be in the wrong.\n\nThe girlfriend's beliefs are problematic from a scientific standpoint, but it's her right to choose her career. The author's stance on not supporting her education financially could be seen as a selfish move. Additionally, the breakup over such a specific issue might indicate that the author's priorities (material concerns and strict adherence to certain scientific views) overshadowed the emotional connection and mutual support in the relationship.\n\nIn summary, while the author's concerns about pseudoscience are valid to him, using financial pressure and career choices as the basis for a breakup might not be fair. The decision hinges on whether differing values about science and medicine are justifiable reasons to end a long-term relationship. It's possible that both parties are at fault, but given the context, the author might be in the wrong for prioritizing his own views over her personal and professional choices, especially when he acknowledges that love should transcend these issues.\n"
