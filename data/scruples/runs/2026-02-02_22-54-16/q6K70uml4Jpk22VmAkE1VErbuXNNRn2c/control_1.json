Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user broke up with his girlfriend because she wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and has certain beliefs about alternative medicine, like the debunked idea that vaccines cause autism. He's struggling with the decision, feeling like it's about money and views on science, but also acknowledges that love shouldn't be about those things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue. The breakup was over differing views on medicine and financial concerns. The author values evidence-based medicine and is worried about supporting her through ND school, which he sees as based on pseudoscience. She, on the other hand, is committed to her path, which he perceives as potentially harmful if patients rely on it instead of conventional medicine.\n\nIs it wrong to break up over this? Relationships can fall apart for many reasons, including fundamental differences in values. If one partner is unwilling to compromise on a core value, like the validity of medical practices, that could be a deal-breaker. However, the author does feel guilty about using money as a reason, thinking it shouldn't matter. But he also believes that her career path is based on pseudoscience, which he sees as dangerous, especially with cancer patients. \n\nThere's a conflict between personal values and relationship values. The author might think that his stance is about health and safety, but the girlfriend values her career choice and beliefs. The question is whether his decision is justified. Some might say that unless she's actively harming others, it's her right to pursue her education. Others might agree with the author that promoting pseudoscience in healthcare is problematic.\n\nThe financial aspect is also a factor. He's not willing to support her through school, which is a significant investment. That's a personal choice, but maybe he should have addressed this earlier in the relationship rather than letting it come to a breakup.\n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's subjective. If the relationship couldn't accommodate each other's core beliefs, then neither is entirely wrong. However, if the author's main issue is her career choice and beliefs, which are her fundamental values, then ending the relationship over that is a personal decision. But he also feels that love should transcend such issues, which adds complexity. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether differing values about medical beliefs are deal-breakers. Since the author is concerned about the potential harm of her practices, he might believe he's justified. However, others might argue that it's not his place to judge her career path unless there's direct harm to him. But given the context, the author's decision is based on his own values, so he's not necessarily in the wrong, but he's also acknowledging the emotional toll. The key is whether the breakup was based on valid concerns or just personal disagreements. Since he's conflicted and feels bad, it's a tough call. But according to the options, A is \"in the wrong\" and B is not. Considering all that, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's making a choice based on his values, even if it's painful.\n"
