Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND). Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author mentions that their girlfriend is set on attending ND school to work with cancer patients. He feels that her beliefs, like vaccines causing autism and homeopathy, are pseudoscience. They had an argument where he brought up the financial burden of her $200k debt over four years, which he would have to support. The breakup happened because of their differing visions for the future, even though he loves her a lot. His friends and family said it shouldn't matter, but he's struggling with the decision and feels guilty.\n\nFirst, I should consider the reasons behind the breakup. The main issues are her career choice in ND and her beliefs in alternative medicine that he considers unscientific. The author is concerned about both the financial aspect and the pseudoscientific views, especially when it comes to treating serious illnesses like cancer. He acknowledges that NDs have a place but can't support giving up modern medicine.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. In relationships, differences in life views can lead to conflicts. If one partner's career path involves beliefs that the other finds unethical or harmful, that's a significant issue. The girlfriend's intention to work with cancer patients while promoting homeopathy and other non-evidence-based practices might be a problem for the author, who values modern science. The financial burden is another materialistic concern, but the author feels it's a factor in their incompatibility.\n\nHowever, love and relationships are supposed to be about mutual respect and support. Is it fair to end a 10-year relationship over a career choice and differing beliefs, even if those beliefs are based on pseudoscience? The author's friends and family say it shouldn't matter, implying that personal views shouldn't dictate the relationship's future. On the other hand, if he can't support her work, especially if he believes it could be harmful, that's a valid concern.\n\nThe author also mentions that he's not against alternative medicine in general but is against abandoning modern medical practices. It's important to note that NDs do learn some conventional medical knowledge, but the core of their practice includes things like homeopathy, which is considered pseudoscientific. If the girlfriend is going to be treating cancer patients with these methods instead of referring them to MDs, that could be a real issue.\n\nBut the breakup was over money and views on science. The financial part is a materialistic reason, which he regrets. However, if her career path leads to significant debt, and he's not willing to take on that responsibility, that's a practical consideration. The deeper issue seems to be the clash of values: he values evidence-based medicine, while she doesn't, which could affect their future together, such as how they handle health decisions for themselves or a family.\n\nIs it right to break up over such a fundamental difference? It's a tough call. If two people can't agree on core beliefs that impact each other's lives, like healthcare and financial responsibility, it might be a dealbreaker. The author is honest about his feelings and the reasons, which is important. He's not being malicious but is acting on his principles. However, love is supposed to be about accepting each other's differences. Maybe he's overemphasizing the pseudoscience aspect and underestimating the strength of their relationship.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's sister is already an ND, which might indicate a family support system for that path. The author is feeling that their future is incompatible because of this. If he can't support her career and her beliefs, even if he loves her, it might lead to long-term resentment. But is that a valid reason for a breakup? Relationships require compromise. If the author is unwilling to compromise on this, maybe he's right in prioritizing his values. However, breaking up over a career choice is a big step, especially after such a long relationship. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because he's making a decision based on his values and practical concerns. However, I also see that it's a sensitive issue. The key points are the pseudoscientific beliefs and financial burden. If he believes she's promoting potentially harmful practices (like using homeopathy for cancer), that's a red flag. So, he's not in the wrong for prioritizing his ethical stance and financial situation. But the emotional aspect makes it complex. The answer might depend on whether these differences are fundamental enough to affect their future. In that case, his decision is his right, even if it's painful.\n"
