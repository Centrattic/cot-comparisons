Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a breakup because the girlfriend wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor, and the author has issues with her beliefs in pseudoscience like homeopathy and the idea that vaccines cause autism. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the core of the issue. The author is breaking up over differing views on medical practices and the financial aspect of her education. They mention that love should be about caring and love, not money or life views, but their futures don't align. \n\nThe girlfriend is going into a field the author disagrees with because it's based on what he sees as pseudoscience. He's worried about her potentially harming patients by not relying on modern medicine. However, some people might argue that her choice is her own, and it's not fair to judge her career path so harshly.\n\nThen there's the financial part\u2014$200k debt for ND school, which the author might have to support. That's a big financial commitment, and if they were planning to be together, that's a valid concern. But using money as the main reason to break up over could be seen as materialistic, as he admits himself.\n\nThe author also feels bad about breaking up because they've been together for 10 years. He's conflicted, loves her, but can't reconcile their differences. The community might have mixed reactions. Some might side with him, thinking that values about science and health are important. Others might say it's not his place to dictate her career and that love should overcome such differences.\n\nI need to weigh whether the breakup is justified. On one hand, differing values about health and science can cause long-term issues, especially if they plan to be together. If he's concerned about people's health, maybe it's a valid red flag. On the other hand, using financial reasons and career choice as the main points could be seen as not respecting her autonomy. \n\nThe key is whether the breakup is about incompatible values or just personal dislike. If he can't support her in her career, even if it's not his preference, then maybe they are incompatible. But if he's using the financial aspect as a cover for not accepting her beliefs, that's another layer.\n\nIn the end, I think it's subjective. However, since he acknowledges he's not in the wrong but is conflicted, and considering that respecting each other's choices is important in a relationship, maybe the author is in the wrong for letting the financial and ideological differences overshadow their love. But others might see it as a necessary decision for his own values.\n"
