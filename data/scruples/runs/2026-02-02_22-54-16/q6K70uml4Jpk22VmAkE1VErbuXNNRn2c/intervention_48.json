Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they broke up with their girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), and he has issues with the pseudoscience aspects of ND, like believing in homeopathy and the link between vaccines and autism. He also mentions the financial burden of her education.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the factors here. Love and relationships often involve compromise, but there are also deal-breakers. The author is conflicted because he loves her but can't support her career path due to disagreements on medical beliefs and financial reasons. \n\nThe key points are: \n1. Beliefs about alternative vs. modern medicine. \n2. Financial commitment of ND school. \n3. Fear of harm if she practices pseudoscience.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's a judgment call. The author is not necessarily being wrong for having strong beliefs about science and medicine. However, ending a 10-year relationship over differing views, especially when love is involved, can be seen as a personal choice rather than a moral wrong. Some might argue that love should overcome such differences, while others might see it as valid to part ways over incompatible core values.\n\nThe financial aspect adds another layer. Supporting a partner's education is a big commitment, and if that's a deal-breaker, it's his choice. However, using money as a reason when the main issue is her career choice (which he disagrees with) might complicate things. \n\nThe author's sister graduating from the same school and his fear of her providing harmful advice (like placebo for cancer patients) suggests he's concerned about her future actions. That's a valid concern if he believes in evidence-based medicine. But is that enough to end a relationship? It depends on how critical this belief is to his values. \n\nOn the other hand, the author admits he feels wrong, which shows internal conflict. The question is whether his reasoning is justifiable. If he can't reconcile his values with her career path, it's a personal decision. But if love should override such differences, then he might be in the wrong. \n\nI think it's a nuanced situation. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because people have the right to prioritize their values. However, others might say that love and commitment should take precedence. The user's initial thought is that the author isn't wrong, so the answer might align with that.\n"
