Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and her beliefs in pseudoscience like homeopathy and vaccinations causing autism. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author mentions that their visions for the future are different. He's against pseudoscience, while she's dead set on attending ND school. He's also concerned about the $200k debt and supporting her through it, which was part of the final argument. The key here is whether his reasons for the breakup are valid or if he's overstepping.\n\nThe girlfriend's beliefs in pseudoscience are a big issue. For example, believing that vaccines cause autism is not supported by scientific evidence and has been debunked. Homeopathy is also widely considered pseudoscientific. If someone is going into a medical field with such beliefs, that could affect how she practices and her patients' health. The author is worried that she might rely on placebos, which is a valid concern because in serious conditions like cancer, delaying or avoiding proven treatments could be dangerous.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. He's saying he broke up because their future visions differ. Love and relationships can indeed be about compatibility beyond just feelings. If two people have fundamental differences in important areas like career choices and beliefs that could impact their lives together, that's a real issue. However, is it wrong to choose to end a relationship over that?\n\nThe debt aspect is also a practical concern. Supporting a $200k education is a significant financial commitment. If the author feels he can't support her through that, maybe it's a matter of personal boundaries. But is it fair to base a breakup on that, especially if the main issue is the career choice and its implications?\n\nHe also mentions that his friends and family say it shouldn't matter, but he's struggling with his own feelings. The fact that he's feeling guilty and scattered suggests it's a tough decision. But in terms of right or wrong, relationships are mutual. If her career path and beliefs are a deal-breaker for him, even if others say it's not, he's not necessarily wrong for prioritizing his values. However, breaking up over someone's career choice and beliefs might come off as judgmental, especially if those beliefs are part of a legitimate field, even if ND isn't as evidence-based as MD.\n\nWait, but the user says the author is an ND and that they're determined to attend school. The author is against pseudoscience, so he's making a case that ND's reliance on pseudoscience is a problem. Is the ND profession inherently pseudoscientific? Well, ND schools include some modern science but also practices like homeopathy. The author might be concerned that she's promoting unproven methods, which could be dangerous if she doesn't refer to MDs when necessary.\n\nSo, the author's reasons are based on his belief in the importance of scientific validity and the financial burden. The question is whether those reasons are justified. If he can't reconcile these differences, maybe it's not his fault. But if he's dismissing her career choice and beliefs without considering her perspective, perhaps he's in the wrong. The post says he's the only person he's ever loved, but if their core values are incompatible, then he might be right to end the relationship. However, using financial support as a point in the argument might be seen as selfish. The answer is tricky. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers whether the action was reasonable. If the author's issue is her beliefs in pseudoscience and the potential harm that could result, that's a valid concern. But if the breakup was primarily about financial support due to her career choice, maybe that's materialistic. However, the post does mention that the main issue was the career path and its implications on their future, not just money. The author is in a dilemma, but given the potential for conflict and the importance of shared values, especially in a long-term relationship, his decision might be seen as justified. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong), but some might argue A (in the wrong) if they think career choices shouldn't matter. It's a balance between personal values and practical considerations.\n"
