Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe user is asking if it's their fault for breaking up with their girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND). The main points they mention are her belief in pseudoscience like vaccinations causing autism and homeopathy, which are debunked by basic science. They also talk about the financial burden of her $200k student debt for ND school, which they would have to support. The breakup was over differing visions of the future and these beliefs. The author feels guilty because they thought love shouldn't be about money or life views, but their decision was based on those factors.\n\nFirst, I should consider what the key issues are. The author is conflicted between their values and the relationship. They care deeply but have a problem with her career choice and beliefs. The question is whether this is a valid reason for a breakup or if the author is wrong to prioritize this over the relationship.\n\nNaturopathic medicine is a controversial field. Some people support it as complementary, while others criticize it for promoting unproven or pseudoscientific methods. The author is okay with alternative medicine if it's effective but draws the line at pseudoscience. They mention their concern that her approach could be harmful, especially if patients don't seek conventional medical treatment. The girlfriend's sister is an ND, which might indicate a family endorsement of the field, but the author still has reservations.\n\nThe financial aspect is another point. The author is worried about supporting her through a school that leads to significant debt, possibly for a career they don't respect. They might feel it's a waste of resources or a burden they can't take on. But friends and family say it shouldn't matter, which adds to the author's confusion.\n\nNow, thinking about whether the author is in the wrong. Relationships often involve compromise, but there are limits. If one partner's core beliefs (like rejecting evidence-based medicine) are a deal-breaker because they could lead to harmful decisions, maybe that's a valid reason. For example, if the author is concerned about the girlfriend advising against vaccinations or conventional treatments for serious illnesses, that could be a legitimate fear. In that case, the author's decision is based on protecting others from potential harm, not just personal dislike.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is unwilling to accept her career choice and beliefs without trying to understand or find a middle ground, that might be where they're wrong. The girlfriend might be passionate about her field, and the author's disapproval could be seen as dismissive of her goals. Also, the financial argument\u2014while it's a real concern\u2014could be a way to mask deeper issues about the girlfriend's beliefs, which the author might not be ready to address openly.\n\nBut the author does express some nuanced views. They acknowledge that NDs have a place as an alternative, not as a replacement. They're okay with things like turmeric for minor issues but not with abandoning modern medicine for serious conditions. This suggests they aren't entirely against the field but are concerned about the pseudoscience elements that could lead to dangerous outcomes. So the conflict isn't just about money but about the potential consequences of her beliefs in practice.\n\nIn relationships, when two people have fundamentally conflicting values, especially those that affect others (like medical advice), it can be a breaking point. If the author can't live with the idea that her career might involve promoting unscientific practices that could harm patients, that's a serious concern. However, if the author didn't communicate this effectively and instead focused on the financial aspect, maybe they should have addressed the beliefs directly first.\n\nThe author also mentions that their family and friends say it shouldn't matter, implying that they're trying to justify their decision but are conflicted. The guilt they feel suggests they value the relationship more than the issue, but their actions show that the issue was a deal-breaker. So, is it right to break up over this? It depends on whether the conflict is irreconcilable. If the girlfriend is dead set on her path and the author can't accept it, maybe it's a matter of personal choice rather than right or wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, the author has valid concerns about pseudoscience potentially leading to harm, which is a significant issue. However, the breakup being over money and career choice might also be a matter of personal values. Since the author's reasoning includes both financial and health-related concerns, it's complicated. But given the potential for her career to involve promoting harmful misinformation, the author's decision could be seen as justified. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), but I need to be careful here. Alternatively, if the author didn't try to work it out or understand her perspective, maybe A (Yes). But the post shows they tried to rationalize their decision, considering both money and beliefs. So I think B is the answer here.\n"
