Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND). The author feels bad about it but thinks their views on medicine are incompatible. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The breakup is over differing beliefs about medical practices. The guy is against pseudoscience and homeopathy, which the girlfriend supports through her career choice. He's also concerned about the financial burden of her ND school, which would be around $200k debt. He mentions that he values love and caring, but their future visions clash.\n\nSo, in relationships, differences in values can be a big deal. The author thinks love shouldn't be about money or life views, but in reality, core values like this can affect compatibility. The girlfriend is committed to a field he strongly disagrees with, which he sees as potentially harmful. The financial aspect adds another layer\u2014supporting her education would be a significant financial commitment, which he's not willing to take on.\n\nHe also mentions that his family and friends say it shouldn't matter, but he still feels it does. This suggests he's conflicted but ultimately made a decision based on his own values. The breakup was over a disagreement in core beliefs and practical matters (money), not something like abuse or betrayal. \n\nIs it okay to break up over differing values? In many cases, yes, especially if they're fundamental. The author isn't being cruel or manipulative; he's honest about his stance. The girlfriend's career choice aligns with her beliefs, even if he disagrees. However, the concern about pseudoscience leading to harm is valid, but that's a personal opinion. Relationships often require compromise, but if compromise isn't possible, then parting ways is a choice.\n\nThe author feels wrong because he loves her, but he's prioritizing his own values and practical concerns. The question is whether that's justifiable. Some might say he's overstepping by judging her career choice, especially if she's passionate about it. Others might agree that values about science and health are too important to compromise on, especially when it comes to potential patient safety.\n\nFinancial reasons can also be a valid point in relationships. Taking on significant debt for a career that one partner is against might be a deal-breaker. The author is taking responsibility for his feelings and the reason for the breakup, which shows he's trying to be honest with himself and his partner.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might feel conflicted, his decision is based on core disagreements that are hard to reconcile. Whether he's in the wrong depends on how one views the importance of those differences. But given the context, breaking up over incompatible values and financial concerns isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
