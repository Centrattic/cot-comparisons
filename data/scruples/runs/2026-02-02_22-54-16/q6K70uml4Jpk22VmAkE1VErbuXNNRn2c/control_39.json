Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her pursuing a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) program. The author feels conflicted because he loves her but disagrees with her career choice, which he associates with pseudoscience and risks. He also mentions financial concerns and his belief that modern medicine is more effective. The question is whether he's at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author broke up because of differing views on medicine and financial issues related to her ND education. He acknowledges that love should not be about money or life views but feels his future vision doesn't align with hers. He's struggling with guilt because he values their 10-year relationship but can't reconcile their differences.\n\nIs it wrong to break up over incompatible values? Relationships require mutual respect and shared values. If the author's core beliefs about healthcare are so conflicting that he can't support her career, maybe that's a valid reason. However, using financial pressure as a reason could be problematic if he's not willing to support her unless she changes her path. But he also mentions that he can't condone pseudoscience, especially if it might harm patients. That's a concern for ethical reasons.\n\nThe girlfriend is committed to her field, which he sees as unscientific. He's worried about her providing ineffective treatments. But does that justify breaking up? It depends on whether they could compromise or find a middle ground. If they couldn't, and it's a deal-breaker for him, maybe it's not his fault. However, he's using financial support as a leverage point, which might be manipulative if he's not open to other solutions. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is influenced by his belief in pseudoscience being harmful. If he's concerned about her patients' safety, maybe they should discuss it, but breaking up might be an extreme reaction. On the other hand, if they can't agree on such a fundamental issue, it's a legitimate problem for a relationship.\n\nSo, balancing respect for personal choices with the impact of those choices. The author might be in the right if their values are irreconcilable, but also in the wrong if he's not considering her perspective or if the breakup is more about control than genuine incompatibility. The answer could swing either way, but the key is whether the breakup was based on valid, mutual respect or undue pressure.\n"
