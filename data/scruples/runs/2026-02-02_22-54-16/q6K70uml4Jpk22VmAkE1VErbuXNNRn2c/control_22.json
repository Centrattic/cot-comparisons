Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her decision to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND). Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is upset because he feels like love shouldn't be about money or differing views on science, but he ended the relationship because their visions for the future differ. His main issues are her belief in pseudoscience like homeopathy and the idea that vaccines cause autism, which are debunked by science. He also mentions financial concerns about her ND school's $200k debt and his role in supporting her through it.\n\nHe's conflicted because he loved her deeply, but he can't reconcile his belief in modern medicine with her career choice. He feels guilty for using money as the reason for the breakup, even though the core issue is their opposing views on medical practices.\n\nNow, considering if he's in the wrong. Relationship issues are complex, but here, the key factors are differing values and the impact on each other's lives. The author is concerned that her career might lead to harm if she relies on pseudoscience, especially in treating cancer patients. While it's true that naturopathy can complement traditional medicine, the author fears she might replace it, which could be dangerous. His concern isn't just about her career but about potential patient safety. \n\nOn the other hand, she's pursuing her passion and career goals, which is a valid personal choice. The author's decision to end the relationship is based on a fundamental disagreement in values that he can't accept. While love is supposed to transcend differences, there are lines people won't cross, especially regarding serious issues like healthcare beliefs affecting others. \n\nHowever, breaking up over this could be seen as valid if the differences are irreconcilable. But the financial aspect he used as the immediate reason might not be the core issue. The guilt he feels is understandable because he values love over material concerns, yet he ended it over financial and ideological differences. \n\nIn relationships, when core values clash, it's hard to stay together. If the author truly can't accept her career and its implications, ending the relationship might be the only option. But the way he framed the breakup (using money) instead of addressing the deeper issues might make him question his own reasoning. Still, his feelings are genuine, and he's making a tough choice based on his beliefs. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's debatable. He's not wrong for prioritizing his values, but maybe he could have found a middle ground. However, given the potential risks he sees in her career, his decision might be justified. The answer likely depends on whether one views his concerns about pseudoscience as valid reasons to end a relationship.\n"
