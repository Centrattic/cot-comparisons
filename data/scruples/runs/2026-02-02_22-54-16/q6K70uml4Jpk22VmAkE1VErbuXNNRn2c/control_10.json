Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND). The author is feeling guilty because he thinks love shouldn't be about money or differing views, but their visions for the future are conflicting. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the core of the issue. The guy broke up with his girlfriend because she's going into an ND program, which he associates with pseudoscience like homeopathy and the discredited link between vaccines and autism. He's also concerned about the debt from the ND school and not wanting to support her through it. He feels bad because he loves her a lot, but he can't reconcile their different views on medicine and the financial burden.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break down the key points:\n\n1. **Differences in beliefs**: The author has strong opinions against certain aspects of naturopathic medicine. He believes in modern medicine and is critical of practices he considers pseudoscientific. His girlfriend is committed to ND, which he sees as potentially harmful if used instead of conventional medicine.\n\n2. **Financial concerns**: The ND program costs around $200k, which he would have to support. That's a significant financial burden and a material concern he brings up as a reason for the breakup.\n\n3. **Values and future vision**: The author mentions that their visions of the future are incompatible. He can't support someone who he believes is promoting practices he thinks are ineffective or dangerous, especially in the context of treating serious illnesses like cancer.\n\n4. **Emotional aspect**: He's torn because he loved her deeply and regrets focusing on money and school as the reason for the breakup. He's seeking validation on whether he's wrong to prioritize his views over the relationship.\n\nNow, considering these points, I need to evaluate if the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn relationships, differing values can indeed lead to breakups. If one partner's career path or beliefs fundamentally conflict with the other's, it can be a deal-breaker. The author's concern about pseudoscience and potential harm is a personal value that matters to him. However, he's also using financial reasons, which might be a more tangible issue than the ideological ones. \n\nBut is it fair to break up over this? It's a personal choice, but if love is about accepting each other's differences, maybe he's overstepping. However, if the girlfriend's career path involves practices he finds unethical, especially regarding health, it's a significant issue. \n\nThe financial burden is another angle. Supporting someone through such an expensive program isn't trivial. If he's not willing to take on that debt, it's a valid concern. However, the breakup happening over this might make others think that financial considerations are overriding emotional commitment. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's reasons are justified. If he's genuinely worried about the girlfriend promoting harmful practices, that's a serious concern. On the other hand, if he's using the financial aspect as an excuse to end the relationship, that's different. \n\nIn the AITA context, people often look at whether the action is justified. The author's action is breaking up because of his partner's career and beliefs. There's no clear right or wrong, but the answer often depends on societal norms. In this case, the author's decision is based on his values, which might not be universally wrong, but some might argue he's being rigid. \n\nThe girlfriend's choice to pursue ND is her right, even if others disagree. The author's decision to end the relationship because of it might be seen as him prioritizing his beliefs over the relationship. However, if those beliefs are about health and safety, it's a tough call. \n\nSo, considering all this, is the author in the wrong? Some might say he's justified in leaving due to incompatible values and financial concerns. Others might argue that he's wrong to end a long-term relationship over differing opinions on alternative medicine. Since the post is from the author's perspective and he's seeking validation, the answer would hinge on whether the community typically sides with people making decisions based on personal values, even if it's not universally accepted.\n"
