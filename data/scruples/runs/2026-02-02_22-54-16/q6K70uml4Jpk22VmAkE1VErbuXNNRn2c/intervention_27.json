Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the breakup story is in the wrong. The situation is about a breakup because the girlfriend is becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), and the author has issues with the pseudoscientific aspects of that field.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core of the conflict. The author believes that the girlfriend's career choice is based on pseudoscience, like homeopathy and the idea that vaccines cause autism. He also mentions financial concerns about her student debt. The breakup was due to differing views on medicine and financial support.\n\nOn one hand, love and relationships often involve accepting differences. The author mentions that love shouldn't be about money or life views, but he ended it because of those factors. That seems contradictory. But then again, when fundamental values clash, it can be a deal-breaker. The author is concerned about the girlfriend's approach to medicine, especially if she's treating cancer patients, which could have serious consequences. He's worried about relying on unproven methods over proven modern medicine.\n\nThe financial aspect is another point. He's not willing to take on the debt for her education, which is a significant commitment. However, using money as the main reason to break up a 10-year relationship might be seen as materialistic. But if the career path is tied to his values, it's a deeper issue than just money.\n\nThe author also feels guilty, which adds complexity. He believes he shouldn't be in the wrong, but he's hurting. The community of friends and family told him it shouldn't matter, but he still feels conflicted. The question is whether his reasons are valid enough to justify the breakup.\n\nConsidering that relationships require compromise, but there are times when core beliefs are incompatible. If he can't accept her career path because of the pseudoscientific aspects, maybe it's a legitimate reason. However, the way the breakup was handled, focusing on money and the specific career choice, might make it seem more about control or financial burden than the actual values.\n\nIn some views, respecting each other's career choices is important, even if you disagree. But if the career choice leads to actions that could harm others (like treating cancer with unproven methods), it's a safety concern. The author's concern about patients not seeing an MD is a real issue if the ND is the primary care provider.\n\nSo, the author's reasons are based on his values and concerns about health and finances. While it's possible to disagree with his decision, it's not clear that it's wrong. Relationships are personal, and differing values can lead to breakups. The key is whether the reasons are justified. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but it's a complex situation where both sides have valid points.\n"
