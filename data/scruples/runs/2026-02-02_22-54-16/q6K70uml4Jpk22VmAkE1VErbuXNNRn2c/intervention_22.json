Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND). He's feeling guilty because he thinks love shouldn't be about money or beliefs, but their differing views on medicine led to the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue. The guy is upset because he values evidence-based medicine and is concerned that his ex is promoting pseudoscience, especially regarding cancer treatments. He's worried about the financial burden of her education and the ethical implications of her future work. On the other hand, the ex is committed to her field, which he sees as potentially harmful if it replaces modern medical practices.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he isn't, but wants my perspective. Let me break down the factors:\n\n1. **Differences in Core Values**: Their fundamental disagreements about medicine are significant. If one partner's career is based on principles the other considers harmful, this can be a deal-breaker. The author is concerned about the safety of patients if NDs replace MDs. This is a valid concern, especially in critical areas like cancer treatment.\n\n2. **Financial Concerns**: The cost of ND school is $200k, which he would have to support. Financial disagreements can strain relationships, but it's not just about money\u2014it's about the future direction of their partnership. If he's not willing to take on that debt for a career he disagrees with, it's a legitimate reason to part ways.\n\n3. **Ethical and Moral Beliefs**: The author is worried that the ND field might endorse practices (like homeopathy) that are scientifically unfounded. This isn't just a minor difference; it's a matter of potentially endangering patients. If one partner's profession could lead to harm, it's understandable that the other would feel conflicted.\n\n4. **Emotional Impact**: The author feels guilty and lost, which shows he values the relationship deeply. However, the breakup was based on a fundamental incompatibility rather than superficial issues. He's grappling with whether his reasons are justified, which is a common dilemma in breakups over core beliefs.\n\n5. **Social Perception**: The author's family and friends told him it shouldn't matter, but that's a common reaction. People often downplay the importance of such differences until they're faced with them. The author's decision is personal and based on his own values, not just external validation.\n\nIn relationships, major disagreements about core values can lead to breakups. The question is whether the author's reasons are valid. If he believes that his partner's career path is ethically problematic and he can't support it financially or morally, it's a valid reason to end the relationship. However, some might argue that love should overcome such differences, but others would say it's about personal ethics and safety.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's decision is based on his beliefs about medical science and ethics, financial responsibility, and future compatibility. He's not acting out of petty reasons but genuine concerns. While it's painful, his choice isn't inherently wrong if he's acting according to his principles.\n"
