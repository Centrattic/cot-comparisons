Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her becoming a Naturopathic Doctor. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author broke up because he disagrees with her belief in pseudoscientific practices like homeopathy and the idea that vaccines cause autism. He's concerned about her field's reliance on non-evidence-based practices, especially if she's treating cancer patients. He also mentions the financial aspect\u2014$200k in debt for her ND school\u2014which he might have to support. The breakup is causing him a lot of emotional pain, and he's second-guessing his decision.\n\nNow, the key points here are the reasons for the breakup. The main issues are ideological differences (scientific vs. alternative medicine beliefs) and financial concerns. Love and relationships often involve compromises, but when core values clash, it can lead to incompatibility. \n\nThe author feels guilty because he loves her deeply, but his decision is based on his belief that her career path is harmful. He's worried about patients relying on placebos instead of proper medical treatment. However, others might argue that personal beliefs shouldn't dictate a relationship's fate unless there's direct harm. But in cases where one partner's career could potentially endanger others (like a doctor giving bad advice), it's a valid concern. \n\nOn the other hand, the breakup over money and debt is a materialistic reason, which the author himself acknowledges. But if he can't support her financially and isn't willing to take on that debt, it's a legitimate factor in the decision. The question is whether it's the author's fault for prioritizing his values over love, or if the relationship couldn't withstand fundamental differences.\n\nSome might say the author is right to prioritize his beliefs, especially regarding potential harm from pseudoscience. Others might say that love should overcome such differences. The author's guilt suggests he's conflicted, but he's also being honest about his inability to accept her path. \n\nIn conclusion, whether he's in the wrong depends on perspective. If the relationship was built on mutual respect for each other's values, then maybe he's wrong. But if they couldn't reconcile their fundamental disagreements, then it's a tough but necessary decision. Given the potential for harm in her profession (as he sees it), I might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
