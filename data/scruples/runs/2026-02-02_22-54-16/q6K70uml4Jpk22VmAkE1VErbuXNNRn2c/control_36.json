Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author feels that the breakup is about differing views on medicine. He believes in modern medicine and is against pseudoscience like homeopathy. His girlfriend is set on becoming an ND, which he sees as promoting ineffective treatments, especially for something serious like cancer. He also mentions financial reasons, the $200k debt for her school, which he would have to support. He's upset because he thinks love shouldn't be about money or life views, but he ended it because their visions of the future don't align.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is committed to her path. Naturopathic medicine is a controversial field; some people trust it, others see it as unscientific. The author is worried that she might rely on pseudoscience, which could be dangerous, like for a cancer patient. He's not against alternative medicine per se, but against replacing modern medicine with it. \n\nNow, the question is if he's in the wrong. In relationships, values and life goals are important. If two people can't agree on fundamental issues, like healthcare practices or financial commitments, that can be a deal-breaker. The author's concern about the debt is a valid financial issue. Supporting someone through a $200k education is a huge commitment. But is that a reason to break up? Maybe not if he's willing to support her despite the debt. However, he also has moral concerns about her career's validity and potential harm, which he can't overlook.\n\nLove and respect are key. If he can't respect her career choice, even if it's unscientific, that's a problem. But he might feel that her beliefs could lead to harm, which is a legitimate safety concern. However, in a relationship, you usually accept each other's choices unless they're harmful. But if she's providing treatments that could be dangerous, that's a different story. The line between alternative and pseudoscience is blurry here.\n\nThe author is conflicted. He loves her but can't support her path due to his beliefs. Breaking up over this might seem harsh to some, but others might agree that differing core values are too much. The financial aspect adds another layer. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, there's no clear answer. However, the author is using both financial and moral reasons. If he truly can't support her career, which he sees as harmful, maybe he's justified. But if he's using the financial issue as an excuse for his deeper discomfort with her beliefs, maybe he's in the wrong. \n\nThe key is whether the breakup was about the relationship being unsustainable due to core differences. The author feels he's wrong for ending it over something \"material,\" but he also can't compromise. It's a tough call. Since he's the one who ended it, but his reasons are about conflicting values and financial burden, some might say he's not in the wrong. Others might argue he should have tried to work it out. \n\nGiven the details, I think the decision hinges on whether the author's concerns are valid enough to justify the breakup. If he can't support her in a way that respects her choices, even if he disagrees, then he's not in the wrong. But if he's ending it primarily because of her beliefs and not respecting her autonomy, he might be. The financial aspect is another factor. Overall, it's a complex situation, but based on the information, the author might not be in the wrong because the decision is based on irreconcilable differences and concerns about safety and financial commitment.\n"
