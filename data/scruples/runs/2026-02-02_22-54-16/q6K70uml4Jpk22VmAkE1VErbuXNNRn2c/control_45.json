Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and holds certain beliefs about alternative medicine. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author ended the relationship because of differences in their views on medicine\u2014specifically, the girlfriend believes in some pseudoscientific ideas like vaccines causing autism and homeopathy. The author feels that modern medicine is essential and can't support someone who might rely on ineffective treatments, especially for serious illnesses like cancer. He also mentions financial concerns about her ND school debt.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. In a relationship, partners should respect each other's choices unless it's a matter of significant personal harm or ethical issues. The author's issue here is the girlfriend's career choice and her beliefs. He's concerned that her work could be harmful if she's advising against modern medicine for critical conditions. However, the girlfriend is pursuing a field that does have a place as complementary medicine, even if the author disagrees with her methods.\n\nOn one hand, love and relationships can't be based on unconditional acceptance of everything, especially when core values clash. If someone's career or beliefs could lead to real harm, that's a valid concern. The author might feel that supporting her career would mean endorsing practices he considers dangerous. On the other hand, breaking up over this seems extreme if the issue isn't directly affecting their lives. He's basing it on her future career and beliefs, which are part of her identity. \n\nThe financial aspect adds another layer. He's worried about taking on her student debt, which is a practical concern. But is that a valid reason to end a 10-year relationship? Maybe not if the real issue is their differing worldviews. The author is conflicted because he loves her but can't reconcile these differences. \n\nI need to consider if the author's reasons are justified. If the girlfriend is practicing ND in a way that's harmful (like advising against cancer treatments), then the author's concern is valid. However, if she's working within the scope of her profession as a complementary option, maybe the author is overstepping. Also, the author's own stance might be rigid, not allowing for differing opinions. \n\nIn relationships, major disagreements can be deal-breakers, especially when they affect daily life and values. However, breaking up over career choices and beliefs alone might be extreme unless those choices directly impact each other's well-being. The author's decision seems based on fear of future issues rather than current problems. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. The breakup is based on differing values and potential future problems. While the author's concern about pseudoscience is understandable, it's debatable whether it's a sufficient reason to end a long-term relationship. The emotional toll on both sides is significant, but the author isn't necessarily wrong if he can't see a future with these differences. However, some might argue that his focus on money and career is materialistic, hence he's in the wrong. \n\nGiven the complexity, I think the answer isn't straightforward. However, considering that the author is prioritizing his own values and the potential risks he's concerned about, maybe he's not in the wrong. But others might say he's dismissing her career choice unfairly. The answer likely depends on perspective, but according to the options given, the answer would be B (No) because the author isn't in the wrong if the breakup is based on irreconcilable differences he can't accept.\n"
