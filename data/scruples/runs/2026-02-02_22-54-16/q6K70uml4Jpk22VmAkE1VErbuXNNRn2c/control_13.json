Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is they broke up with their girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), and the author is conflicted about it.\n\nFirst, the main reasons the author gives for breaking up are two-fold: the girlfriend's belief in pseudoscience (like vaccinations causing autism, homeopathy) and the financial burden of her ND school (around $200k). The author feels that love shouldn't be about money or life views, but their own vision for the future conflicts with hers. They mention they care deeply for her but can't reconcile their differences.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break this down. \n\nOne perspective is that personal beliefs and values can be a valid reason for a breakup if they significantly impact the relationship. If two people can't agree on core issues, especially when those issues involve making major life decisions (like career paths and financial commitments), it might be unsustainable. The author is concerned about the financial commitment and the girlfriend's professional role, which they see as potentially harmful (e.g., someone dying because they rely on ND instead of MD). This is a serious concern, especially if the author believes that the girlfriend's future work could lead to real harm. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that this is a case of not respecting the girlfriend's choices and career path. Naturopathic medicine, while controversial, is a valid career choice for many people. Even if the author disagrees with the pseudoscientific aspects, they might have chosen to work through that with open communication and mutual respect. The financial aspect is also a tough issue, but using that as a reason to break up, especially after 10 years, might be seen as prioritizing money over love. The author seems to acknowledge that they \"shouldn't\" have focused on money, but they did, which makes them question their own actions.\n\nThe author also mentions that friends and family said it shouldn't matter, but the author still feels conflicted. This suggests that the decision was hard for them, which might indicate they're struggling with the rightness of their choice. However, the fact that the two people have fundamentally different views on medicine and future plans might make the relationship untenable in the long run, even if they love each other.\n\nThere's also the ethical angle: if the author believes that the girlfriend's future career could lead to harm (e.g., patients not receiving proper medical care), that's a significant ethical concern. They might feel a responsibility to distance themselves from someone whose career could, in their view, cause real harm. But that's a heavy burden to place on a relationship, and it's possible that the author is conflating personal beliefs with actual ethical wrongdoing.\n\nIn terms of the financial aspect, if the author is unwilling to take on that debt, it's a practical issue. But if the relationship is based on mutual support, perhaps the author could have discussed other options with their partner, like finding a way to manage the debt together or the girlfriend choosing a different field. However, the girlfriend is \"dead set\" on attending the school, which implies she's not open to compromise. That leaves the author in a tough spot.\n\nSo, putting it all together: is the author in the wrong? If the breakup is primarily due to the girlfriend's career choice and beliefs, which the author sees as harmful, but which are valid in the medical field for some, it's debatable. The author might have valid concerns, but acting on those to end a 10-year relationship could be seen as prioritizing personal beliefs over the relationship. However, if those beliefs are fundamentally incompatible with the author's values and future plans, then it's a legitimate reason. The financial argument is more about practicality, but again, it's a matter of whether the author was willing to make that sacrifice for love.\n\nThe key points are:\n\n- The author's concern about pseudoscience and potential harm.\n- The financial commitment and unwillingness to support it.\n- The 10-year relationship and the emotional impact.\n- The girlfriend's determination to pursue ND despite the author's objections.\n\nIn the end, whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether personal beliefs and values are justifiable reasons for a breakup. If the author acted out of love and can't reconcile the differences, they might not be in the wrong. But if the breakup is more about not respecting the partner's choices or prioritizing money over love, they might be. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is acting on their own values and concerns, even if they feel conflicted. However, the financial aspect is a gray area. The user's friends and family said it shouldn't matter, but the author's own feelings and beliefs are valid in this context. So, B.\n"
