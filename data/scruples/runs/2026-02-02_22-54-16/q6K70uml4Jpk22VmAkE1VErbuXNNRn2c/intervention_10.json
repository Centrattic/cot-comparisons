Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend because she's becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) is in the wrong. The main points here are about the conflict between their views on alternative medicine versus modern medicine and the financial burden of her education.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that his girlfriend believes in pseudoscientific ideas, like vaccines causing autism, which is a well-known myth debunked by science. He's concerned that her career path, which he sees as promoting ineffective or even harmful practices, could lead to patients not getting proper medical care. This is a valid concern from a public health perspective. \n\nHowever, the breakup was also due to financial reasons\u2014supporting her $200k ND school debt. That's a significant financial commitment, and the author might feel that he can't take on that responsibility. But is financial support a valid reason to break up if it's not his to bear? Like, if he's not in a position to support her education, maybe they should have discussed it earlier. But if it's her choice and he's not willing to take on that debt, that's a personal decision.\n\nNow, the ethical question: Is it fair to end a relationship over ideological differences about medical practices? Love and relationships can be complex. Some might argue that differing values, especially those that could impact significant life choices or public health, are a legitimate reason. Others might say personal beliefs shouldn't dictate such decisions unless they directly harm the partner.\n\nThe author feels guilty because he thought love shouldn't be about money or views on life. But he also feels that his partner's career path could lead to harmful practices. There's a tension here between personal values and relationship commitment. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's subjective. The author made a choice based on his values and what he can accept. If the girlfriend is committed to her path despite his concerns, the breakup might be seen as the author protecting his own values. But if the relationship could have found a middle ground, some might argue he acted too hastily. However, the decision to end a relationship is personal and not inherently wrong unless there's coercion or harm involved. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't in the wrong for making a decision based on his values and the circumstances they've discussed. The answer would be B (No).\n"
