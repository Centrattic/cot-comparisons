Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they broke up with their girlfriend because she wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and holds beliefs in pseudoscience like vaccinations leading to autism and homeopathy. The author feels conflicted because they love her but can't support her career choice due to the money involved and their disagreement with the scientific validity of her field.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The breakup is based on differing values and future goals. The author is concerned about the financial burden (200k debt) and the pseudoscientific aspects of her chosen field. On the other hand, the girlfriend is committed to her path, which the author can't support. \n\nIs it wrong to break up over fundamental differences in beliefs and life goals? In relationships, when core values clash, it can lead to incompatibility. The author mentions that love shouldn't be about money or life views, but in reality, people often break up over such issues. However, the author is questioning their own decision, feeling guilty for prioritizing material and belief differences over their love.\n\nThe sister has already graduated in the same field, which the author sees as potentially harmful. The author is worried about someone relying on ND instead of MDs, which could lead to serious health consequences. This is a valid concern from a health and safety perspective. However, the breakup was initiated by the author, and they are now regretting it, feeling like they ended a 10-year relationship over material reasons.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Breaking up because of fundamental disagreements isn't inherently wrong, especially if those differences are deal-breakers for one partner. However, the author's reasoning includes financial concerns and their belief in pseudoscience. The author is also critical of NDs but acknowledges they have a place. Yet, the main issue seems to be the girlfriend's adherence to pseudoscience and the financial commitment, which the author can't support.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's decision is her own, and the author's choice to leave is based on their inability to reconcile these differences. It might be a matter of differing values. The author could be in the right if they feel the relationship is unsustainable due to these issues. However, the guilt they're feeling suggests they might be prioritizing external factors over the relationship. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's reasons for breaking up are justified. The financial aspect is a personal decision, but the belief in pseudoscience is more about personal values. If one partner can't accept the other's career and beliefs, even if they love them, it might be a valid reason. But the author is struggling with this, which complicates the judgment. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a complex situation. The author's actions are based on their own values and concerns, which they can't compromise on. While some might argue that love should overcome such issues, others might see it as a legitimate reason to end a relationship. Since the question asks if the author is in the wrong, and considering that they made a personal choice based on their beliefs and financial concerns, the answer might be B (No), they are not in the wrong. However, there's a nuance here. The author is conflicted, but their decision is based on their convictions. The wrongness depends on perspective, but since the author is questioning their own decision, it's a matter of personal values rather than an objective right or wrong.\n"
