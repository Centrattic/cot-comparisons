Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend over her becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) is in the wrong. The author feels guilty because they ended a 10-year relationship over this, but they have their reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is against the pseudoscientific beliefs the girlfriend holds, like vaccines causing autism and homeopathy. They also mention financial concerns about her ND school's $200k debt. The author believes that NDs have a place but can't support giving up modern medicine. The girlfriend's sister is an ND, and the author fears she might provide ineffective treatments to cancer patients.\n\nNow, I should analyze the ethical aspects here. In a relationship, shared values and beliefs are important. If one partner's career choice and beliefs contradict the other's core values, especially regarding health and science, that's a significant conflict. The author is worried that her profession could harm patients by relying on pseudoscience. That's a serious ethical concern. However, love and commitment can sometimes overcome differences, but there's a limit when it comes to issues affecting others' well-being.\n\nFinancial responsibility is another factor. The author mentions supporting her through $200k in debt. That's a major financial burden. If the author can't afford or isn't willing to take on that debt, it's a practical reason to end the relationship. However, it's still a material issue, which the author feels bad about.\n\nBut then, is the author right to prioritize their values over the relationship? Relationships require compromise, but not on matters that one considers non-negotiable. The author's stance on pseudoscience could be seen as rigid, but if they genuinely believe their partner's work could be harmful, that's a valid concern. On the other hand, the breakup over this might be seen as dismissing her dreams and choices, which could also be problematic.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, but the answer might depend on the severity of the ethical concerns versus the relationship's value. If the author genuinely believes that the ND field is harmful and can't support a partner in that career, ending the relationship to stay true to their values isn't necessarily wrong. However, the way the breakup was handled, focusing on money as the main issue, might have been insensitive. The author's guilt suggests they value their partner and the relationship, but they feel compelled to act based on their principles.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision is based on their ethical and financial concerns, which they find incompatible with their partner's career. Whether they're in the wrong depends on whether you prioritize the relationship's emotional bond over these concerns. Since the author tried to rationalize their decision based on their values and practical considerations, the answer leans towards them not being in the wrong (B).\n"
