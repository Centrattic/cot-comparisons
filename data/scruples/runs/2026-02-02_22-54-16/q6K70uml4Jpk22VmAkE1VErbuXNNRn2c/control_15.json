Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a naturopathic doctor (ND). He mentions issues with her beliefs in pseudoscience like the idea that vaccinations cause autism and homeopathy. He feels that while alternative medicine has its place, he can't support giving up modern medicine. The main points he brings up are about their differing views on medicine and the financial burden of her ND school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core of their breakup. He says love shouldn't be about money or views on life, but their visions of the future are different. He's conflicted because he cares deeply but can't reconcile their differences. The key factors here are their fundamental disagreements on medical beliefs and financial concerns.\n\nOn one hand, he's concerned about pseudoscience and the potential harm of relying on alternative medicine over proven methods, especially for serious conditions like cancer. He's worried about her career path leading to ineffective treatments. On the other hand, he's also bringing up the financial aspect, which he admits is a material issue, which makes him feel guilty.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, relationships require compatibility in core values. If he can't accept her career and beliefs as they conflict with his values (scientific validity and ethical concerns about patient safety), then maybe it's a legitimate reason to break up. However, love is supposed to be about accepting each other's differences unless they're harmful. But in this case, he's worried her work could be harmful. \n\nThe financial issue is also a factor. Supporting her through a costly education that he disagrees with might be a strain. But is that a valid reason? If they had discussed this earlier and still wanted to be together, maybe he's using the financial issue as an excuse for the deeper belief conflict.\n\nBut he's conflicted and feels guilty, suggesting he's torn between his love and his principles. The question is whether his reasons are justified. If he truly believes her work could harm patients, that's a moral issue. However, if he's dismissing her career because of personal disagreements without considering her perspective, that could be the problem. It's a tough balance between personal ethics and relationship commitment.\n"
