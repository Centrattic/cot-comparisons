Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND). Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that his girlfriend believes in pseudoscience like the idea that vaccinations cause autism and homeopathy. He has a problem with that because he thinks modern medicine works and doesn't want her to promote ineffective treatments, especially for cancer patients. He also brings up the financial aspect, mentioning a $200k debt for her ND school, which he wouldn't be able to support. The breakup happened because their visions for the future were conflicting.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let me break down the factors. \n\n1. **Differences in Values and Beliefs**: The author is concerned about his partner's beliefs in pseudoscience. He feels that relying on alternative medicine over evidence-based practices could be harmful, especially in serious cases like cancer. From his perspective, this is a significant moral or ethical issue. However, the girlfriend might see her career choice as valid and her own way of contributing to healthcare. \n\n2. **Financial Aspects**: The cost of ND school is a big factor. The author can't support her through the debt. Financial disagreements can be a legitimate reason for relationship issues, but does it justify breaking up? It might depend on whether the financial burden was a mutual decision or if there were other ways to handle it without breaking up.\n\n3. **Love and Respect**: The author acknowledges that he loves her deeply but feels that their fundamental differences are insurmountable. Love can sometimes involve compromise, but there's a point where conflicting values make a relationship unsustainable. The question is whether his reasons are justified or if he's overstepping by using them as a reason to break up.\n\n4. **Communication and Understanding**: Did they try to work through the issues? The last argument was about money, but maybe there were deeper issues about her career and beliefs. If they didn't have open discussions about these values earlier, it might have led to a sudden breakup. However, if they had discussed it and still couldn't reconcile, then it's a more valid reason.\n\n5. **Ethical Considerations**: From a public health standpoint, promoting pseudoscience can be harmful. The author's concern about people dying due to not consulting MDs is valid. On the other hand, the girlfriend's choice to pursue ND might be her passion and she believes in its efficacy, even if it's not supported by basic science.\n\n6. **Emotional Impact**: The author is feeling guilty, which complicates things. He might be struggling between his feelings and his rational concerns. Guilt doesn't necessarily mean he's wrong, but it shows internal conflict.\n\nIn terms of societal perspectives, some might argue that personal beliefs about career choices shouldn't affect a relationship unless they directly harm each other. Others might say that when a partner's actions could harm others (like giving bad medical advice), it's reasonable to have a problem with it. \n\nFinancial burdens are also a real concern. If the author couldn't support her through the debt, and she wouldn't compromise, it's a practical issue. But if the breakup was primarily about her career choices and not the financial aspect, that might be different. However, in the post, the final argument was about money, which he brought up as the main reason. That might suggest that the financial issue was the immediate trigger, but the underlying issues were about her career beliefs.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the balance between respecting each other's choices and the impact of those choices. If the author's main issue is her belief in pseudoscience and potential harm to patients, that's a serious ethical concern. However, using money as the breaking point might be a more tangible issue. It's complicated because both sides have valid points, but maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong if his concerns are genuine and well-founded. Alternatively, if he could have found a way to support her without compromising his values, maybe he is. But given the circumstances as presented, I think the answer leans towards B (No, he's not in the wrong), but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
