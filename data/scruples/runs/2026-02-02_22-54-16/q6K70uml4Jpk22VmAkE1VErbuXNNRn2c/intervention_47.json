Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend because she's becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) is in the wrong. The person feels conflicted because they love her but disagree with her career choice due to pseudoscientific beliefs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author believes that NDs rely on pseudoscience, like homeopathy, and that this could be harmful, especially if someone with cancer avoids proper medical treatment. They also mention the financial burden of her education. On the other hand, the girlfriend is committed to her path, and the breakup is causing emotional pain. \n\nI should think about whether the author's reasons are valid. Disagreement over career paths can be a legitimate issue in relationships. However, is this a deal-breaker? The author is concerned about pseudoscience, which is a real issue, but does that justify ending a 10-year relationship? Also, the financial aspect is a practical concern, but perhaps they could have discussed compromises instead of breaking up.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of personal values and how they affect relationships. If one's core values, like trust in science, are at stake, that could be a significant conflict. However, the author also mentions that love shouldn't be about money or views, but their decision was based on those things. \n\nI need to consider whether the author acted out of self-interest or genuine concern for his partner's well-being. If he genuinely believes she's putting patients at risk by relying on unproven methods, that's a moral concern. But if this is more about personal discomfort with her beliefs rather than actual harm, it might be a different scenario.\n\nAlso, the emotional impact on both parties is important. Ending a long-term relationship over this is a big step. Maybe there were other factors contributing to the breakup, or perhaps they couldn't find a middle ground. \n\nIn the end, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the reasons for the breakup are justified. If the concern is about potential harm from pseudoscience, it's a valid but subjective issue. If it's about incompatible values, it's a common reason for breakups. The author might not be in the wrong if he felt he couldn't support her path, but others might see it as an overreaction.\n"
