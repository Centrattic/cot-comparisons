Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her pursuing a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) program. The author feels conflicted because he loves her but can't support her career choice due to his beliefs about pseudoscience and financial concerns.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issues here. The main points are the disagreement over the validity of ND practices versus modern medicine and financial concerns about the ND school's cost. The author is upset because he thinks love shouldn't be about money or life views, but his decision was based on those factors.\n\nIn relationships, compatibility is often about shared values and goals. If two people have fundamental disagreements on important issues, it can lead to conflict. The author's concern is that ND practices, like homeopathy and beliefs about vaccines causing autism, are pseudoscientific. He's worried about the potential harm if she advises patients against modern medicine. This is a valid health concern, especially if she's working with cancer patients who might rely on her advice over evidence-based treatments.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is committed to her career path. She might believe in the efficacy of naturopathy and see it as a legitimate field. The author's financial objection is also significant, as $200k in debt is a major burden. However, using money as the primary reason to break up over a career choice that aligns with her values could be seen as materialistic, especially if he claims that love shouldn't be about money.\n\nBut there's a balance between respecting a partner's aspirations and having differing views. If the author can't support her career due to his beliefs about its validity, that's a deep-seated disagreement. However, if the breakup was primarily over financial reasons, it might be seen as selfish. The author feels bad because he prioritized material concerns over love, which he's questioning.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's reasons are justified. If he genuinely believes that her career could harm patients (as he mentions the risk of someone dying due to not seeing an MD), that's a serious ethical concern. However, the financial aspect is a personal value judgment. The author's own stance is that NDs have a place as alternatives, which suggests he's not entirely opposed. Yet he can't support her choice, which might indicate a lack of compromise.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to find common ground. If the author's main issue is the pseudoscientific aspects, maybe they could have discussed boundaries, like her not advising against modern treatments. But if he can't reconcile his beliefs with her career path, it's a deal-breaker for him. The fact that he's struggling with guilt suggests he's aware that his reasons might not be purely based on love, which complicates the moral aspect.\n\nUltimately, whether he's in the wrong depends on perspective. If he's right about the pseudoscience, then his decision is protecting patients. If he's wrong, then he's abandoning her for unfounded reasons. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong now, not the validity of the debate itself. Since the breakup is over differing core beliefs and financial reasons, which are subjective, it's a personal choice. The author might not be in the wrong if he believes the issues are irreconcilable, but he's also aware of his guilt, indicating internal conflict.\n"
