Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they broke up with their girlfriend because she wants to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND), and he has issues with the pseudoscientific aspects of that field, like homeopathy and the belief that vaccines cause autism. He also mentions financial concerns, like the $200k debt for her school, which he would have to support her through.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons for the breakup. The main points are ideological differences about alternative medicine and financial responsibility. On one hand, the author is concerned about his partner entering a field he sees as based on pseudoscience, which could lead to harmful practices, especially with cancer patients. He also brings up the financial burden, which is a practical concern. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is passionate about her career choice, which is a significant part of her identity. The author's decision to break up over these issues suggests that their core values and future visions are incompatible. The question is whether breaking up over this is justified or if the author is in the wrong for prioritizing these factors over their love and 10-year relationship.\n\nLove and relationships often involve compromise, but there are also deal-breakers. If the author can't accept his partner's career and beliefs because they conflict with his values (especially regarding health practices that could impact others), that's a serious issue. However, using financial responsibility as a reason might also be seen as pragmatic but could feel selfish or materialistic, especially if the financial support was his own choice to offer.\n\nThe author feels conflicted because he loves her deeply but can't reconcile these differences. The community might support his stance if they agree that pseudoscience in healthcare is a red flag, especially in a field that could harm patients. Alternatively, others might say that personal beliefs about alternative medicine shouldn't dictate a relationship's fate unless those beliefs lead to harmful actions.\n\nThe key is whether the break-up is based on valid, non-negotiable issues or if the author is overstepping by letting professional disagreements and financial concerns override the relationship. The fact that the author's friends and family say it shouldn't matter might indicate that his reasons are more about personal values than objective right or wrong. However, the potential for the girlfriend's career to cause harm (as he sees it) is a strong argument in the author's favor. \n\nIn the end, the decision to break up is personal, but the author's justification hinges on the ethical implications of her career and financial concerns. If the author can't support her in a way that aligns with his values, then ending the relationship might be his only choice. But whether he's \"in the wrong\" depends on whether those reasons are valid. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and considering the pseudoscientific aspects he's concerned about, I might lean towards A (in the wrong), but the financial argument complicates it. However, given the ethical stance on pseudoscience, maybe B (not in the wrong). I'm a bit torn but I think the answer is B.\n"
