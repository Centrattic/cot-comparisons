Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the given text is in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend over her pursuing a career as a Naturopathic Doctor (ND). The main points to consider here are the reasons behind the breakup and whether they justify the action.\n\nThe author mentions that their girlfriend believes in pseudoscientific ideas like the link between vaccines and autism, and that she's committed to ND, which the author sees as rejecting modern medicine. The author also brings up financial concerns about her $200k debt for ND school. They feel guilty because they think love shouldn't be about money or views, but they couldn't reconcile their differing visions for the future.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's reasons are valid. Disagreement over career paths and values can be a legitimate reason for a breakup. However, the key here is the depth of the disagreement. If one partner's career involves promoting practices that the other sees as harmful (like delaying medical treatment for cancer), that could be a significant issue. The author is concerned that the ND could potentially harm patients by relying on unproven methods, which is a serious ethical concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the author also admits that they care deeply for their partner and that the breakup feels materialistic. They might be struggling with the conflict between their feelings and their principles. The financial aspect adds another layer, as supporting a large debt could be a practical burden.\n\nI should consider if the author is justified in prioritizing their values over the relationship. If the author believes that their partner's career choices could lead to patient harm, it's understandable to want to distance themselves. However, the decision to break up because of a career path and philosophical differences is subjective. Some might argue that personal beliefs shouldn't override love, but others might see it as necessary for their own peace of mind.\n\nThe author's guilt comes from feeling they're prioritizing money and views over love. But if the core issue is a fundamental disagreement on important matters like healthcare ethics, which could affect others, the author might feel it's a valid reason to end the relationship. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer hinges on whether the reasons for the breakup are valid, then it's a matter of perspective. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing their values, but they might be acting out of fear or differing ethical stances. Alternatively, some might argue that the author is being too rigid by not accepting a different viewpoint. \n\nGiven that the author's concern is about potential harm to patients and financial burden, which are significant factors, it's possible they're not wrong. However, if the breakup is driven by a lack of acceptance of differing philosophies, even if well-intentioned, it could be seen as the author's fault. \n\nThe answer likely depends on how society views the validity of the concerns versus the sanctity of the relationship. Since the user is asking for a choice between A (author is wrong) and B (not wrong), the nuances here suggest that the author might not be in the wrong, as they're acting based on their beliefs about what is right, even if it's painful.\n"
