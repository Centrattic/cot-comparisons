Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's going to become a Naturopathic Doctor. The author feels conflicted, believing love shouldn't be about money or views but their differing beliefs on medicine led to the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The girlfriend is pursuing a career in naturopathy, which the author disagrees with because he thinks it's pseudoscience. He mentions issues like vaccine denial and homeopathy. The author also brings up financial concerns about the 200k debt for her school. \n\nIn relationships, differences in core values can be a big deal. But is medicine a core value? The author seems to think that her career path is based on misinformation and could be harmful, especially if she's working with cancer patients. That's a serious concern. However, he's using financial support as a point, which might complicate things. \n\nOn the other hand, relationships should ideally be built on mutual respect. If the author can't accept her career choice, maybe that's a deal-breaker for him. But is it wrong to end a relationship over such a fundamental disagreement? The author is struggling with guilt, thinking it's about material things rather than love. But if her beliefs could lead to harmful practices, maybe his concerns are valid. \n\nAlso, the financial aspect is a practical issue. If he feels he can't support her through the debt, that adds pressure. But is that a fair reason to break up if they can't compromise? The question is whether his reasons are justified. \n\nI think it's a complex situation. The author's concerns about pseudoscience and potential harm are serious. However, using financial support as a leverage in the breakup might not be fair. If they couldn't find common ground despite trying, maybe the breakup is understandable. But whether he's in the wrong depends on the depth of their discussions and if there was mutual understanding. Since the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but others might argue differently, I need to weigh both sides. \n\nGiven the potential for harm in her career choice and his inability to support it, maybe the author is justified. However, breaking up over this might seem harsh because it's personal and not just about the issues. I'm a bit torn but lean towards B (No) because his concerns are about safety and core beliefs, which are hard to compromise on.\n"
