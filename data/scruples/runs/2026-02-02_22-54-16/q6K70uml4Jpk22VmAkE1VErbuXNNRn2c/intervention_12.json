Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her becoming a Naturopathic Doctor is in the wrong. The question is whether he's at fault or not. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the main points from the author's post: He broke up with his girlfriend because she's committed to becoming an ND, which he views as promoting pseudoscience like homeopathy and linking vaccines to autism. He's concerned about the debt from the ND program and not wanting to support her through that. He feels love should be about caring, not about differing views on medicine. He's struggling with the idea that he ended a 10-year relationship over material issues like money and career choices.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. In relationships, values and core beliefs can play a big role. If both people can't agree on fundamental issues, it's hard to maintain the relationship. The author is concerned about her medical views leading to harm, especially with cancer patients. That's a serious concern. If someone is going into a field that he believes could be harmful or ineffective, that's a red flag for him. But is it fair to break up over it?\n\nOn the other hand, love is supposed to involve accepting each other's differences. He acknowledges that love shouldn't be about money or life views. But he can't reconcile his belief in modern medicine with her path. The debt issue is practical, but maybe they could have talked about it financially. However, the core issue seems to be the medical philosophy, which he sees as dangerous.\n\nIs it wrong to end a relationship because of such a fundamental disagreement? It's a tough spot. If you truly believe that someone's career could lead to harm, like giving false hope to cancer patients, that's a valid concern. But relationships also require compromise. Maybe there's a middle ground where they could support each other's views without forcing each other to adopt the opposite.\n\nThe author is feeling guilty because he ended the relationship over money and career, which he sees as material. But if the core issue is the ethical concern about her practice, then it's not just about money. However, the way he framed the breakup (focusing on money) might have been the wrong approach. Maybe addressing the medical beliefs first would have been better.\n\nAlso, the ND field is controversial. While some naturopathic practices can be beneficial, others are considered pseudoscience. If the girlfriend is dead set on using methods that the author believes are harmful, that's a big conflict. However, the author's stance is also rigid. Maybe he could have found a way to support her without endorsing her methods, but if he can't, then the breakup isn't entirely his fault.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a complex situation. The author had valid concerns about his partner's career path leading to potential harm, which he couldn't reconcile. While breaking up over this is painful, it's not necessarily wrong if the core values are irreconcilable. However, the way he approached the breakup, focusing on money, might have been a symptom of deeper issues. But given the seriousness of the medical disagreements, he's not in the wrong.\n"
