Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her plans to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND). The author feels conflicted because he loves her but can't agree with her career choice and its implications.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author is upset that their breakup was over something material like money and career choices, which he initially thought love shouldn't be about. He mentions she believes in pseudoscience like vaccines causing autism and homeopathy, which he disagrees with. He also raises concerns about the financial burden of her ND school, which he would have had to support. The breakup was over a disagreement about fundamental beliefs and career paths, which he now feels bad about because it ended a 10-year relationship.\n\nNow, thinking about the ethics here. In relationships, differing values can be a significant issue. If both partners can't reconcile their core beliefs, it's often a red flag. The author's concern about pseudoscience leading to harmful practices (like not seeking MD for cancer) is a valid health concern. However, using money and career choices as the reason for breaking up might be seen as materialistic, which he himself acknowledges. But the underlying issue is about incompatible values regarding science and medicine. \n\nIs it wrong to break up over this? Well, if the relationship can't withstand such fundamental differences, especially when it comes to health beliefs that could affect others, it might be necessary. However, he also feels it's over something material, but the core is about values. The author might not be in the wrong if the relationship was based on mutual care but couldn't handle the differences in fundamental beliefs. However, the emotional toll and the way he frames it as a material issue complicates things. \n\nOn the other hand, if love is supposed to transcend such differences, then he might be in the wrong for prioritizing his values over the relationship. But if those values are non-negotiable and could lead to harmful outcomes, it's a valid reason. The answer hinges on whether the break up was over incompatible values (which is reasonable) or over material concerns (which might be less so). Given the post, it's a mix of both, but the author is more focused on the values. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the core issue is about incompatible values, even if it's painful.\n"
