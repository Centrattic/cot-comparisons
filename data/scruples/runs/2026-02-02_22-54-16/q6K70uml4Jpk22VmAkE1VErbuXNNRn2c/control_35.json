Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her decision to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points from the post. The author is conflicted because he broke up with his girlfriend due to her career choice, which he views as based on pseudoscience. He mentions her beliefs in things like vaccines causing autism and homeopathy, which are debunked. He also brings up financial concerns about her ND school's $200k debt. However, he feels bad because he believes love shouldn't be about money or life views, but their differing visions for the future caused the split.\n\nNow, considering if he's in the wrong. The breakup was based on differences in values and career paths. In relationships, it's common for differing values to lead to splits. However, the question is whether his reasons are valid. He argues that her career could potentially harm patients by relying on pseudoscience, which is a serious concern. On the other hand, he's using financial support as a reason, which might be more about personal boundaries than her field itself.\n\nBut wait, the core issue here is his belief that her career is based on pseudoscience. If he's truly against pseudoscience and the potential risks it poses, then his decision is based on ethical and safety concerns. However, NDs do have a recognized field, even if some practices are controversial. The author might be conflating all ND practices with pseudoscience, whereas some NDs do collaborate with conventional medicine.\n\nAlso, the financial aspect is a personal choice. If he can't support her debt, it's a valid reason, but combining that with his views on her field might be problematic. The key is whether his reasons are justified. If he's okay with alternative medicine that works (like turmeric for bruises) but not certain practices, maybe there's a middle ground. But if he's against the core of her career's principles, it's a deal-breaker for him.\n\nIn relationships, major disagreements about career paths that have ethical implications can be a reason to part ways. So, the author might not be in the wrong if he can't reconcile his values with hers. However, the way he framed the breakup (focusing on money) might make him question his own reasons. But overall, if the core issue is about conflicting values regarding medical practices, it's a personal decision. The answer would depend on whether society deems his reasons as valid, but since the post is from his perspective, the judgment is subjective.\n"
