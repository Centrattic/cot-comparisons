Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she's becoming a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and holds some pseudoscientific beliefs. The author feels conflicted because he loves her but can't reconcile their differing views on medicine and the financial burden of her education.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that the main issue is their conflicting visions for the future, both in terms of medical beliefs and financial responsibility. He's concerned that her field relies on pseudoscience, like homeopathy and the idea that vaccines cause autism, which are debunked by mainstream science. He also brings up the financial aspect of her $200k debt. He feels guilty breaking up over such material things, yet he can't imagine a future with someone who might be promoting harmful practices.\n\nOn one hand, love and relationships are supposed to be about mutual respect and compatibility. If fundamental values and life goals are irreconcilable, it might be reasonable to part ways. The author is worried about his partner's future career making decisions that could harm others, which is a significant ethical concern. Financial responsibilities also play a role here, and he might not be willing to support her education due to personal beliefs and the potential debt.\n\nOn the other hand, it's important to ask if the author handled the situation appropriately. Did he try to work through these issues before deciding to break up? Was there open communication? The post mentions a \"last argument,\" implying that maybe they didn't resolve things. Also, while his concerns about pseudoscience are valid, dismissing her entire career path and beliefs without understanding her perspective might come across as judgmental. Relationships require compromise, and maybe there was a lack of that here.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author's stance is overly rigid. He acknowledges that NDs can have a place as alternatives, but his main issue is when they're used in place of medical practices. However, if the girlfriend is practicing within the law and not actively recommending dangerous treatments, perhaps the author's fears are exaggerated. It's also possible that he's projecting his own fears onto her, assuming she would use her ND education to replace MD advice, when maybe she doesn't intend to do so.\n\nThe emotional aspect is crucial. The author is clearly hurting and feels like a bad person for ending the relationship over what he perceives as material reasons. But if the core issues are about conflicting values and future incompatibility, then maybe it's not entirely his fault. However, breaking up over career choices and beliefs can be seen as materialistic, especially if the relationship was supposed to be about love and support regardless of differences.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's concerns about pseudoscience and financial burden are valid, the decision to break up based on these factors might be seen as prioritizing his own values over the relationship. If both parties are unwilling to find common ground or compromise, breaking up might be necessary. However, the way the author approaches it might come across as judgmental, and perhaps he didn't make enough effort to understand or work with her on these issues. So, while not entirely in the wrong, there might be aspects of his approach that could be questioned, leading to a nuanced answer. But according to the user's options, it's either A or B. Given that the user thinks the author isn't wrong, and considering that incompatibility in core values can be a legitimate reason for a breakup, I might lean towards B, but there's a gray area.\n"
