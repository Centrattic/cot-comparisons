Love should not be about money or view on life. It should be about how much you care about someone, the feeling of LOVE you feel for them. But in my case my vision of our future and the love of my life's vision is totally different. I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine. If a ND wants to prescribe Karen's toddler turmeric for his bruise than so be it.  But I just can not condone giving up on modern medical practices in favor of pseudoscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so wrong. None of this is should matter. Love is love and I do not think that I could care for someone more than her. But I just can not see myself with someone going into this field. In our last argument that ultimately lead to our break up the main thing I brought up was the money, about 200k dept for a 4 year ND school that I would have to support her threw. I feel so shitty that is the point I made to end this amazing beautiful thing. I have already talked to my family and friends and they all let me know that it shouldn't matter. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but to me sadly it does. I have been numbing the pain of a 10 year relationship ended over the past few hours just totally mentally falling apart. A relationship to the only person I have ever loved over something so material as a fucking school and money. I feel sick to my stomach. Sorry is this post is scattered brained but I am absolutely lost and hurt worst than I knew was possible. \n\nHer sister has already graduated from this small school with a ND degree and I feel she at best is providing a placebo effect and at worst is providing a placebo effect to someone who will die because they have not seen a MD. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-like post is in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend over her decision to become a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) and her beliefs in pseudoscience like homeopathy and the idea that vaccines cause autism. The author feels conflicted because they love their partner but can't support her career path due to disagreements over medical practices and financial concerns.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The breakup is due to differing views on science and medicine, and financial reasons. The author believes that NDs have a place as an alternative but can't support giving up modern medicine. The girlfriend is dead set on her path, which the author sees as pseudoscience, especially in the context of treating serious illnesses like cancer. The money issue is also a factor\u2014$200k debt for school that the author would have to support.\n\nNow, thinking about whether the author is in the wrong. Relationships require mutual respect and compatibility. If core values and beliefs are conflicting to the point of being deal-breakers, it's a personal choice. However, the author is breaking up over issues that others might consider material or superficial, like career choice and debt. On the other hand, the author is concerned about their partner potentially providing harmful advice, which is a valid concern for someone's health and safety. The question is whether this concern justifies the breakup or if the author is overstepping by not supporting their partner's choices despite loving them.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that their friends and family said it shouldn't matter, but the author still feels it does. It's possible that the author's values around evidence-based medicine are a fundamental part of who they are, making this a legitimate reason for a breakup. However, some might argue that love should overcome such differences, and the author is prioritizing their beliefs over their relationship. \n\nAnother angle: the financial burden. The author is concerned about supporting her through a costly education. That's practical, but if both were willing to take on the debt together, maybe that's a shared decision. However, if the author isn't willing to take on that debt, it's a valid reason to part ways.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author's concern about pseudoscience in a medical field could have real consequences. If the ND's practices could harm patients, that's a serious issue. But does the author have the right to dictate their partner's career choices? It's a balance between personal values and respecting autonomy.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer hinges on whether the author's reasons are justified. If the author genuinely believes that supporting a career based on pseudoscience is harmful and can't reconcile that with their values, it's a legitimate reason to end the relationship. However, others might see it as the author being inflexible. Since the author is conflicted and feels guilty, it's a tough call. But given the potential risks of the partner's career in the author's eyes, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The key is that the author is breaking up over fundamental differences in values and scientific belief, which can be valid in relationships. If two people can't agree on core issues, especially when one feels the other's profession could be harmful, it's a reason to part ways. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's a more nuanced take. Maybe the author is overreacting, but given the seriousness of the medical field, it's understandable. So, I think the answer is B.\n"
