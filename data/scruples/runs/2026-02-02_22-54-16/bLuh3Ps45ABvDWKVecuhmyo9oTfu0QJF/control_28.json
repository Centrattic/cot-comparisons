She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent who's upset that their kids see their ex-wife (the kids' biological mom) as a hero, even though the ex has a troubled history.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The father is a single dad for three years, did a lot to care for the kids, remarried, and now the stepmom helps a lot. They support the kids financially, take care of their needs, and even pay for things like the pageant. The ex is described as having multiple issues\u2014jail time, affairs, job losses, living with her mom. The father doesn't ask for child support because she can't support herself. \n\nThe daughter is going into a pageant and asks if she should say her mom is her hero. The father responds by pointing out that they provide everything, and that the mother only sees the kids two weekends a month with no chores, maybe using food stamps. He's frustrated that the kids don't see the stepmom and him as the ones doing the hard work.\n\nNow, the key question is whether the father is in the wrong for his reaction. The user wants a yes (A) or no (B) answer based on the reasoning. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's tricky. The father is voicing his frustration, but he doesn't outrightly criticize the ex directly. He's trying to explain to his daughter the reality of each parent's role. But is it wrong to express that frustration, especially if he's not badmouthing the ex? The daughter is trying to decide who to name as her hero, and the father is trying to highlight his own and the stepmom's contributions. \n\nHowever, he might be influencing her decision by pointing out the differences in their parenting styles. But he's not telling her not to choose her mom; he's just giving her food for thought. Also, he's been supportive of the ex despite her shortcomings. So perhaps he's justified in his feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the kids have the right to have a positive relationship with both parents, even if one isn't perfect. The father's frustration is understandable, but he's not forcing his views. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's not being malicious, just expressing his perspective. But some might argue he's undermining the ex without cause. However, given the context, he's been fair and hasn't directly attacked the ex. \n\nI think the consensus here would be B. He's not in the wrong.\n"
