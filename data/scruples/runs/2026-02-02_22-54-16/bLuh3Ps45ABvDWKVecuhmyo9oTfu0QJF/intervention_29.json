She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a parent who's raising their kids after a divorce, and the kids still see their ex-mother, who has a problematic history, as a hero. The author is frustrated because they're doing all the hard work and providing for the kids, while the ex-mom isn't contributing and has a lot of issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a step-parent who's taken on the role of a primary caregiver, providing financially and emotionally. The kids live with them full-time but get to visit their birth mother every other weekend. The ex-mother isn't paying child support and has a history of being unreliable. The author is frustrated that the kids don't recognize their contributions and still view the ex as a hero.\n\nThe key issue here is the author's response to the daughter's question about who to choose as a hero. The author points out the ex-mother's lack of responsibility and their own step-parent's efforts. The author is trying to manage the kids' expectations without being negative towards the ex-mother, which is a common challenge in co-parenting situations.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, children often maintain a positive image of their birth parents, especially if they're not the ones who left or who aren't the ones making the daily sacrifices. It can be tough for the custodial parent to feel unappreciated. However, the author's approach was to highlight the reality of the situation rather than directly criticizing the ex. They didn't badmouth the mother but explained the difference in responsibilities between living with one parent versus visiting the other.\n\nLegally, the ex-mother's lack of child support is a separate issue, but the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to demand it, as the ex can't support herself. The author is focusing on providing for the kids despite that.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid because they're doing the hard work. But the way they addressed the daughter's question could be seen as trying to influence her perception. However, they didn't force the child to choose a new hero; they just presented their perspective. The answer might depend on cultural norms and how one views co-parenting ethics. Some might argue that the author is justified in making their contributions known, while others might think it's not their place to compare parenting styles.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. The author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical. They're managing their own emotions and trying to guide their daughter's thinking without being negative. The answer here would likely lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), as they're handling the situation with awareness and trying to balance their feelings with the children's well-being.\n"
