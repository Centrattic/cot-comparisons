She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for resenting that their children see their mom as a hero, even though the mom has a problematic history. The ex-wife has been in jail, had affairs, lost jobs, and lives with her mom. The author is a single dad for three years, remarried, and provides for the kids. He doesn't ask for child support because the mom can't support herself. Now, his daughter is entering a pageant and wants to say her mom is her hero. The author explained the situation to his daughter, pointing out the stepmom and he provide everything, while the mom only sees the kids every other weekend.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the author's frustration and his approach to addressing it with his daughter. He didn't directly criticize the mother but tried to explain the situation to the daughter. He's not badmouthing her, just highlighting the support they provide. His resentments are understandable given the ex's actions and the fact that the kids still idolize her. However, is he wrong for feeling this way? The question is whether he's in the wrong for resenting the children's perception of their mother as a hero.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider if the author overstepped. He didn't tell the daughter not to say her mom is a hero, but he did explain the other side. He's trying to encourage the daughter to consider the reality of the situation. Since he's not directly interfering with the kids' relationship with their mom but is expressing his own feelings of being undervalued, it's possible he's justified in his feelings. The ex's actions were harmful, and the author's efforts are significant. However, the situation might be complex in terms of family dynamics. Still, the author's approach seems reasonable, and his resentment stems from a place of feeling unappreciated despite his sacrifices. So, answer B (No).\n"
