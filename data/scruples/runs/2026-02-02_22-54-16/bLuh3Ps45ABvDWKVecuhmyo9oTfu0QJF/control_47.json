She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the user is a stepfather who's been taking care of his children since their mother, who has a problematic history, couldn't. He's now remarried, and they provide for the kids financially and emotionally. The issue comes up when his daughter is preparing for a pageant and might say her hero is her mother.\n\nThe user is frustrated because the kids see their mother as a hero despite her issues. He's not directly badmouthing her but is pointing out the reality of the situation to his daughter, explaining that their stepfamily provides for them daily. He wants the kids to appreciate what they have but is upset that they still idolize the mother who isn't there most of the time.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he's not outright saying negative things about the mother, just highlighting the contrast between the mother's limited role and the stepfamily's full-time care. He's also not forcing the daughter to criticize her mother; he's just explaining the situation. The key here is that he's trying to help the daughter understand the context without personally attacking her mother. \n\nBut maybe he's being a bit harsh? He's making a comparison that could make the daughter feel conflicted. However, his intent is to help her recognize the stepfamily's efforts. Also, the mother's actions (affairs, jail, etc.) are part of the reality, and the user is pointing out the practical aspects of being a parent full-time versus part-time. \n\nThe user is in a tough position because he wants the kids to have a positive view of their mother but also wants them to acknowledge the support they get from him and his wife. He's not forcing the daughter to say something, just guiding her. It seems like he's trying to balance between protecting the mother's image and expressing his own frustrations. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because he's not directly attacking the mother but explaining the situation. He's trying to help his daughter make an informed choice rather than blindly idolizing her mother. While there's a valid concern about the daughter's perception, the user's approach isn't malicious. He's being honest about the circumstances without being cruel. So, he's not in the wrong here.\n"
