She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the user is a stepfather who's been taking care of his children full-time since their mom was a mess. He's now married and they provide everything for the kids. The problem comes up when his daughter asks if she should say her biological mom is her hero for a pageant. The user responds by pointing out that their mom only sees them every other weekend and doesn't have to deal with the full-time responsibilities. The user feels resentful that the kids idolize the mom without acknowledging all they do. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The kids are living with their stepfather and stepmom full-time, and the biological mom has visitation rights. The stepfather is frustrated because the kids don't seem to appreciate the care they receive from him and his wife. He's not saying bad things about the mom directly, but he's trying to correct the daughter's perception by highlighting the differences in parenting time and effort.\n\nIs it wrong for him to express his feelings? Well, he's not attacking the mom in front of the daughter, but he is pointing out the reality of the situation. The daughter is trying to choose a hero, and he's helping her think about the actual contributions each parent makes. However, he might be influencing the child's choice. The key here is whether his response is appropriate. \n\nHe mentions he's forgiven the mom, which is good, but he's still frustrated. The daughter is young (8 years old) and might not fully grasp the complexities. The stepfather's response could be seen as trying to shift the daughter's loyalty, which might be harmful if it makes the daughter feel conflicted or pressured. On the other hand, he's trying to be honest about the realities of their living situation. \n\nThere's a balance between being a good parent and not undermining the other parent. The stepfather isn't badmouthing the mom, but he's highlighting the differences in parenting roles. It's possible that his frustration is valid, but his approach might be making the daughter feel like she's supposed to choose between parents. \n\nIn custody situations, it's generally advised for both parents to not badmouth each other in front of the kids. The stepfather isn't doing that, but his comment could be seen as manipulating the child's perception. The daughter is in a tough spot, wanting to be kind to her mom but also feeling the support from her stepfamily. The stepfather's frustration is understandable, but his method might not be the best. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He's expressing his feelings and trying to help the daughter make a decision, but it might be influencing her in a way that's not healthy. The answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's using the situation to compare the two parents, which could lead to the child feeling torn. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because he's being honest about the care they receive. \n\nI think the key point is that while his frustration is valid, the way he's addressing it might not be the healthiest approach for the child. He should probably let the daughter form her own opinion without influencing her based on his own resentments. So leaning towards A, but not entirely sure.\n"
