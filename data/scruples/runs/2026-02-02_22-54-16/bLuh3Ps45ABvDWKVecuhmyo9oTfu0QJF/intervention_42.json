She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author resenting that their children see their ex-wife as a hero, despite the ex's history of problems. The author is a single dad now remarried, providing for the kids, while the ex is described as someone with multiple issues. The daughter is preparing for a pageant and asked if she should name her mom as her hero. The author responded by pointing out the reality of their mother's situation versus the support they provide.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author feels they're being unfair because they're providing everything, while the ex isn't. The author didn't want to hurt the ex but is frustrated. The children's admiration for the mother is based on limited time and perhaps idealized perception from the mother's side, which might not reflect reality.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's response could be seen as undermining the children's feelings. Even though the author is trying to correct the daughter's view, the way they expressed it might come across as harsh or critical. The author mentions not derogating the mother, but the response does frame the mother's parenting as easier because she doesn't have to do it all the time. That might be a way of pointing out the mother's shortcomings, which could affect the kids' perception negatively.\n\nBut the author's main point is about the frustration of being the one who consistently provides for the children while the mother isn't contributing. The author isn't attacking the mother directly but is trying to explain the reality to the child. However, by the time the daughter is 8, she's been exposed to both parents, and her view of her mother might be influenced by the time she spends with her. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way they addressed the daughter's question might not be the best approach.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's intention was to correct the daughter's perception by highlighting the actual efforts of the stepmother and themselves versus the mother's situation. However, doing so might not be the right way to handle the daughter's admiration. The children deserve to have both parents' perspectives respected, even if one isn't actively providing. The author's response could be seen as undermining the mother in front of the child, even if indirectly. \n\nBut considering the author's efforts and their position as the primary caregiver, maybe it's not entirely their fault. The question is whether their response was in the wrong. If the author is trying to manage the child's perception without directly badmouthing the mother, is that acceptable? Or is it wrong to influence the child's view like that? \n\nI think the line between guiding a child and undermining a parent is thin here. The author's frustration is valid, but the way they expressed it might be problematic. The answer might hinge on whether the author is in the wrong for their approach. Since the author didn't explicitly tell the daughter to not choose her mom, but instead explained the reality of both parents' situations, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the response does frame the mother's parenting in a negative light relative to their own. So perhaps the author is in the wrong for that, even if their intentions were good. \n\nBut another perspective is that the author is just being honest with the child about the reality of their living situations. The mother isn't supporting the children, so the author is pointing out that the mother's ability to be a parent is limited. It's about honesty rather than criticism. In that case, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nI'm a bit torn. On one hand, the author wants the child to have a realistic view. On the other, the author's frustration might be clouding their judgment. The answer might be B (No) because the author is trying to be honest about the reality, not attacking the mother directly. But maybe it's A (Yes) because they are influencing the child's perception. Hmm. Need to decide based on the context.\n"
