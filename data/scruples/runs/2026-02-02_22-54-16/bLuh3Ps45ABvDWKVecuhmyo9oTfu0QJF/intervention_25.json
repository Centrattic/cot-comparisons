She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a stepfather who's been taking care of his ex-wife's kids since she's been a problematic parent. He's providing everything they need, and he's not asking for child support. The issue comes up when his daughter, who's in a pageant, is considering naming her biological mother as her hero. The author responds by pointing out the contrast between the mother's limited involvement and the care they provide.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The ex-wife has a history of issues\u2014jail, affairs, unemployment, etc.\u2014so the kids probably don't see her as a negative figure. They might just see her as their mom, even if she's not present much. The stepmother and author are the primary caregivers, but the kids still look up to the biological mom.\n\nThe author's response to the daughter is meant to highlight the practical differences in parenting roles. He's not directly putting down the mother but is pointing out the reality of their situations. He's frustrated because he feels unappreciated compared to the biological mom. But is it right to express that frustration to the child in this context?\n\nI think the key is whether the author is undermining the mother's image. The stepfather says he's not trying to derogate her, but he's making a comparison that could make the child question her mother's role. However, he's also being honest about the contributions both parents make. It's a delicate balance. The child is trying to form her own opinion, and the stepfather is guiding her by pointing out the facts.\n\nIs it wrong to express the frustration? Maybe not, because the stepfather is trying to help the child understand the different roles each parent plays. But there's a risk of making the child feel conflicted. However, given the ex-wife's history, the stepfather's perspective is valid. He's not forcing the child to choose but is presenting a reality check.\n\nSo, I think the answer would be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. He's acknowledging his own feelings and trying to help the child form a balanced view without outright criticizing the mother. The main issue is the child's potential bias due to limited exposure to the real challenges of parenting, which the stepfather is addressing honestly.\n"
