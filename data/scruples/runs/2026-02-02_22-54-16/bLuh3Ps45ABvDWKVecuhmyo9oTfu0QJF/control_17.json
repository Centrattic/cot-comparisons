She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the user is a stepfather who's taking care of his three kids full-time. His ex-wife has a history of jail time, affairs, job losses, and lives with her mom. He's been a single dad for three years, now remarried, and they support the kids financially and emotionally. They pay for everything from healthcare to activities to braces. The ex doesn't pay child support because she can't support herself.\n\nThe issue comes up when his daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should say her mom is her hero. The stepfather responds by pointing out that they provide for the kids, while the mother only sees them weekends and it's easier to be a parent part-time. He doesn't want to badmouth the mother but is frustrated the kids see her as a hero.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, is it wrong to feel resentful? Everyone has the right to feel their emotions, so resentment itself isn't the issue. The problem is how he expressed it. He didn't outright say negative things about the mother, but he did imply that her parenting isn't as hard because she's only there weekends. \n\nHe mentions that he doesn't derogate her, but his statement does compare their parenting efforts. The key here is that he's trying to influence the daughter's perception by highlighting their own sacrifices versus the mother's. Even if he's not directly badmouthing her, he's still making a comparison that might undermine the mother's role in the child's life.\n\nChildren often have a positive view of their birth parents, especially if they see them less frequently. The stepfather's frustration is valid given the sacrifices he and his wife have made, but the way he addressed it might be problematic. By pointing out the mother's shortcomings indirectly, he could damage the daughter's relationship with her mom or make the daughter feel conflicted.\n\nAlso, the mother isn't present to defend herself, and the kids are caught in the middle of their parents' conflict. Even if the stepfather's intentions are good, the method could be harmful. The right approach might have been to acknowledge the mother's role without comparison, while expressing feelings of being undervalued. But instead, he used the daughter's question to highlight his own family's efforts, which could be seen as manipulative or unfair.\n\nIn terms of parental responsibility, the stepfather's actions might not be entirely wrong in terms of his feelings, but the way he handled the situation could be considered inappropriate. He's not directly criticizing the mother, but the implication is there. The kids need to maintain a relationship with both parents, and the stepfather's response might interfere with that. Therefore, the answer could be A (he's in the wrong) because his response could harm the child's relationship with the mother, even if unintentionally.\n"
