She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for resenting their kids seeing their mom as a hero, even though the mom has a lot of issues. The user is the step-parent, taking care of the kids after the ex was a single mom for three years. The ex has a history of jail time, affairs, job losses, and lives with her mom.\n\nThe step-parent is providing everything: healthcare, activities, school stuff, even a car for the son and braces for the daughter. They don't ask for child support because the ex can't support herself. Then, when the daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should say her mom is her hero, the step-parent responds by pointing out the ex's issues and that they take care of the kids. \n\nThe question is whether the step-parent is wrong. Let me think about the dynamics here. The step-parent is frustrated because the kids idolize the mother despite her shortcomings. The step-parent is trying to be fair, not badmouthing the ex, but still feels unappreciated. \n\nOn one hand, the step-parent is providing a lot and might feel overlooked. But they should also consider the kids' emotional needs. The daughter is asking for advice on the pageant question, and the step-parent's response might be a way to highlight the ex's lack of support. However, is it appropriate to bring up the mother's flaws in that context? Maybe the daughter is just trying to be polite, or maybe she genuinely admires her mom despite the issues. \n\nThe step-parent's frustration is understandable, but how they expressed it might be problematic. Telling the daughter that the ex doesn't support them and implying she's not a good parent in a moment when the daughter is trying to decide how to answer a pageant question could be hurtful. The step-parent might be projecting their own feelings of resentment onto the daughter. \n\nAlso, the ex's situation is complicated. She can't support herself, so child support isn't an option. The step-parent is doing a lot, but the kids still have a relationship with their biological mom. It's possible that the daughter's admiration for her mom isn't about the step-parent's efforts but more about the bond and the time spent with her mom, even if it's less. \n\nIs the step-parent overstepping by bringing up the mother's shortcomings? They didn't outright criticize her but pointed out the realities. It's a gray area. The step-parent might not be in the wrong because they're trying to explain their perspective, but they should be careful not to undermine the mother in front of the kids. However, they have a right to feel frustrated. \n\nMaybe the step-parent isn't entirely wrong, but they could handle it differently. Since the question is whether they're in the wrong, and the answer is A for yes or B for no. Considering the situation, the step-parent's response was a reaction to their own feelings of being unappreciated, but they might have overreacted by bringing up the mother's flaws in a way that could manipulate the daughter's answer. So maybe A (they are in the wrong) because they shouldn't have tried to influence the daughter's hero choice by highlighting the ex's negatives, even if it's true. They should model respect for the mother while still expressing their own feelings in a healthier way, perhaps. \n\nAlternatively, some might say B (not in the wrong) because the step-parent is being honest about the situation and wants the kids to recognize the support they provide. It's a tough call. But I think the key is that the step-parent is trying to manage the daughter's answer to a question, which could be seen as interfering with the child's autonomy in expressing admiration. The step-parent's frustration is valid, but the way they addressed it might be crossing a line. So maybe A is the answer.\n"
