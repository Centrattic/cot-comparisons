She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for feeling resentful that their children still see their ex-wife, who they describe as problematic, as a hero. \n\nFirst, the author is a stepfather who has been taking care of the kids for three years, handling all the responsibilities, and providing for their needs. The ex-wife has a history of issues\u2014jail time, affairs, job losses\u2014and currently lives with her mom. The stepfather doesn't ask for child support because he knows she can't support herself and has forgiven her.\n\nNow, the daughter is preparing for a pageant and wants to know if she should say her mom is her hero. The stepfather responds by pointing out that their current family provides everything, while the ex only has them every other weekend with no chores, and they can eat whatever they like there, implying it's easier to parent part-time. He's frustrated they see the ex as an angel and don't appreciate what he and his wife do.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the stepfather's reaction is justified. He's not belittling the ex directly but is expressing frustration through the daughter's question. He's trying to make the daughter aware of the realities, maybe to balance her perspective. Is it wrong to feel resentful? Well, resentment is a common human emotion, especially when you're giving so much and not being acknowledged. But the stepfather is in a position where he's the caregiver now, and the kids are with him full-time. It's natural for him to feel undervalued if the kids idolize the ex who isn't providing for them.\n\nHowever, the way he responded might be problematic. He didn't directly put down the ex but highlighted the differences in how they're treated. But is that in the wrong? He's not attacking the ex personally, just pointing out the circumstances. The stepfather's intentions seem to be about fairness and wanting the kids to recognize everyone's contributions. \n\nOn the other hand, the kids are still children, and their mom, despite her flaws, is their biological parent. They might not have the emotional capacity to fully understand the complexities yet. The stepfather wants them to have a balanced view. But is it his place to influence that? He's not forcing them to criticize their mom, just making them aware of the other side. \n\nThe stepfather also mentions he doesn't want to hurt the ex, which shows he's trying to be considerate. His resentment is valid given the situation, but the way he's expressing it could be seen as undermining the ex indirectly. However, since he's not explicitly badmouthing her, maybe it's just a natural emotional response. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. Resentment itself isn't \"wrong,\" but how it's handled matters. The stepfather's approach might not be the best, but his feelings are understandable. The children's perspective is also important; they might still need to maintain a positive image of their mom, even if she's not the ideal parent. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. His feelings are justified given the circumstances, and he's trying to balance the kids' perceptions without directly attacking the ex.\n"
