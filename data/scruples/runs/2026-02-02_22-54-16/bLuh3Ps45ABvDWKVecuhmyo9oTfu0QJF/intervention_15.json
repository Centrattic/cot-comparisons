She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for resenting that their children see their ex-wife as a hero. The ex-wife has a history of issues\u2014jail, affairs, job losses, and currently lives with her mom. The author is a single dad for three years, now remarried, and provides everything for the kids. They don't ask for child support. When the daughter asks about naming her mom as a hero for a pageant, the author responds by pointing out the contrast between the stepmom's support and the ex's inconsistent care.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the author's intentions. They don't want to hurt the ex-wife and have forgiven her. But they feel unappreciated since the kids idealize the ex. The author's response to the daughter is direct but not derogatory. They\u2019re trying to explain the reality of their mother's situation versus their current caregivers.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the ex-wife's behavior is questionable, and the author is providing for the kids. However, the way the author explained things to the daughter could be seen as trying to influence the child's perception of their mother. But the author isn't badmouthing the ex; they're just highlighting the differences in support. It's a sensitive situation, but the author's actions seem motivated by a desire for the kids to recognize the support they receive. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
