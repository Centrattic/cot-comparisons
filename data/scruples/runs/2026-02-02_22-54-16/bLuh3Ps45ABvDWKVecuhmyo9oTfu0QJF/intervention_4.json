She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a father who's dealing with his ex-wife's negative behaviors and is frustrated that his kids still see her as a hero.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The ex-wife has a history of legal issues, job instability, affairs, and lives with her mom. The father was a single dad for three years, now remarried, and takes care of the kids' needs. He doesn't ask for child support because she can't support herself. He forgives her but feels frustrated when his daughter wants to name her biological mom as a hero in a pageant. He responds by explaining the differences in their living situations, implying that being a parent part-time is easier, but they do it full-time.\n\nThe main question is whether the father is wrong for expressing his frustration in that way. The writer thinks he's not in the wrong, but wants confirmation. \n\nFrom a legal and ethical standpoint, the father has the right to express his feelings, especially since he's the one providing for the children. However, his approach might be harmful. He's pointing out the ex-wife's shortcomings indirectly, which could undermine the kids' perception of her. Even though he doesn't want to derogate her, his comments might do so. He's also not being entirely honest with the child, perhaps, by not acknowledging that the ex-mom is their mother regardless of circumstances.\n\nBut on the other hand, the father has a valid point about the disparity in parental effort. He's been the primary caregiver and is justified in feeling underappreciated. The ex-wife isn't contributing financially or otherwise, which adds to his frustration. \n\nThe daughter's question is about choosing a hero, which is a personal choice. The father's response might be trying to guide her to recognize the support they provide, but it could be seen as manipulative. However, considering the context of the ex-wife's behavior and the father's situation, his response is a natural reaction to feeling unacknowledged.\n\nI think the key here is whether the father's response was harmful. By pointing out the differences in living situations and the effort required, he's not outright disparaging the ex-wife but is expressing his perspective. However, the daughter is in a position where she has two parents, and the father's influence might be affecting her perception. \n\nIn family dynamics, especially in co-parenting situations, it's important to avoid undermining the other parent unless there are safety issues. The ex-wife, despite her flaws, is still a parent. The father's frustration is understandable, but his approach might not be the healthiest for the children. However, given the circumstances, it's a complex situation where the father's actions are driven by a sense of responsibility and a desire to be recognized for his efforts.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. Legally and ethically, he's not obligated to be nice about the ex-wife, but the way he responds could affect the children's relationships. However, given the ex-wife's history and the father's role, maybe he's justified in feeling this way. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's expressing his feelings in a way that's not directly abusive or harmful, but more about his perspective on parenting efforts.\n"
