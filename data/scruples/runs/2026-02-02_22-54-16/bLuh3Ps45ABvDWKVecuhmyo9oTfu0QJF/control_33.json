She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's children seeing their mother (the author's ex-wife) as a hero despite her problematic behavior, like jail time, affairs, job losses, and living with her mom. The author is now a single dad for three years, took care of the kids, remarried, and provides everything for them without asking for child support. \n\nWhen his daughter asks if she should say her mom is her hero for a pageant, he responds by pointing out that they live with the author and his wife, who take care of them, while their mom only sees them two weekends a month. The author is frustrated because the kids don't seem to appreciate what they do, even though he doesn't badmouth the ex-wife.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's response was appropriate. He's trying to encourage his daughter to consider the reality of their living situations. He's not directly criticizing the ex-wife but is highlighting the differences in parenting roles. However, the daughter might be influenced by her limited time with her mom, who perhaps gives her more attention, even if it's not always responsible parenting.\n\nThe key points are: the author is providing for the kids, the ex-wife isn't contributing financially but gets idealized. The author's frustration is about the kids' perception versus the reality. But the father's response could be seen as manipulating the child's perspective, even if he's trying to correct it. However, since he's not badmouthing the ex, maybe he's just being honest about the situation.\n\nIn terms of right/wrong, it's a tricky balance. The father is justified in feeling frustrated if the kids don't appreciate his and his wife's efforts. However, the way he's influencing the daughter's answer might be problematic. He's not outright negative but is pointing out the practical aspects. The daughter might not fully understand the context. But the father's actions are to guide the child's thinking, which is a parent's role. However, maybe he should have discussed it in a way that allows the child to form her own opinion without comparing the two parents.\n\nThe question is whether the father is in the wrong for expressing his frustration in that context. If the answer is B (No), then he's not in the wrong because he's trying to be honest about the situation and his contributions. But if the answer is A, it's because he's possibly undermining the child's relationship with her mother, even if indirectly. But since he's not badmouthing her, it's more about the child's perspective. The father's response is to give the child information to make her own decision, not to attack the mother. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
