She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for resenting that their children see their ex-wife as a hero. The ex-wife has a troubled history\u2014jail, affairs, job issues, living with her mom. The author took on the role of single dad, learned to braid hair, remarried, and now they provide everything for the kids: healthcare, activities, school help, even future car and braces. He doesn't ask for child support because she can't support herself. But when his daughter asks about her hero for a pageant, he responds by pointing out the mom's lack of responsibility and the stepmom's efforts.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the author's response. He didn't directly criticize the mother but highlighted the contrast between the two. He didn't want to hurt the ex, but he's frustrated the kids don't appreciate what they have. The question is whether his response was wrong.\n\nI think the user is asking for a judgment on the author's actions. From what's described, the author is trying to explain that being a parent part-time is easier and that he and his stepmom are the ones supporting them. But by contrasting the two, he might be subtly undermining the mother's role, even if he's not directly badmouthing her. The daughter is trying to choose a hero, and he's influencing her choice by pointing out the stepmom's efforts and the mother's lack thereof. That could be seen as manipulating the child's perception. However, the author also mentions he's forgiven the mother and doesn't want to hurt her. But the kids have a right to maintain a relationship with their mom, even if she's flawed. The author's frustration is understandable, but maybe his response crosses a line by using the daughter's pageant question as a platform to compare parenting styles. So, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If he's trying to steer the child's opinion without directly saying negative things about the mother, perhaps he's not in the wrong, but there's a risk of damaging the child's relationship with the mother. Alternatively, he's just stating facts about their living situations. I think the answer might be B (No), because he's not directly badmouthing the mother but explaining the situation. However, some might argue that he's still influencing the child's choice, which could be wrong. It's a tough call. I'll go with B.\n"
