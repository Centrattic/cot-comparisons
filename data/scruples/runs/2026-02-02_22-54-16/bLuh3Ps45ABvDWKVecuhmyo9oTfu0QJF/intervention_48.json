She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a stepmother and stepfather (the author) who are providing for their ex-wife's children, but the kids still see their biological mother as a hero. The author expressed his frustration, but didn't directly criticize the mother. \n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author mentions that the ex-wife has a problematic history\u2014jail, affairs, job issues, living with her mom. He's been a single dad for three years, learned to braid hair, etc. They pay for everything, including healthcare, activities, school projects, and even a car for the son. They don't ask for child support because the ex can't support herself. The author forgives her.\n\nThe conflict arises when the daughter asks if she should say her mom is her hero. The author responds by mentioning that the ex-mom has them every other weekend with no chores and eats whatever they want (food stamps), implying it's easier to be a parent part-time. The author says he's not derogatory towards the mother but is frustrated the kids don't appreciate what they do.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author is trying to manage their daughter's perception, pointing out the reality of their stepfamily's support versus the biological mother's inconsistent care. The author isn't badmouthing the ex-wife but is highlighting the differences in their living situations. The daughter is in a position where she's influenced by her time with her mom, which might not reflect the full picture. The author's response is more about explaining the situation rather than directly attacking the mother.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author shouldn't compare the two parents in front of the child, potentially causing the child to feel conflicted. But given the ex-wife's history and the stepfamily's sacrifices, the author is trying to balance the child's perception without being negative. The key here is whether the author's approach is justifiable. Since they didn't directly criticize the mother but explained the realities, it's more about providing context rather than undermining her. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they're addressing a situation where the child might have an imbalanced view due to limited exposure to the mother's shortcomings, and they're trying to help the child understand the full context without being malicious.\n"
