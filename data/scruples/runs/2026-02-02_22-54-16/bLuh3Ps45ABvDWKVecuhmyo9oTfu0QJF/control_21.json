She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person (let's call them \"the author\") is a step-parent who has been taking care of their children full-time, while the kids see their biological mother, who has a lot of issues, as a hero. The author is frustrated because they feel like their step-parent and their own efforts aren't appreciated, and the kids idealize the mother despite her shortcomings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author mentions that the mother has a history of problems: jail, affairs, job losses, currently living with her mom. The author has been the primary caregiver for three years, even learning to braid hair for their daughter, and now has a new spouse who also supports the kids. They provide healthcare, activities, school projects, etc. The mother doesn't pay child support because she can't support herself, and the author doesn't want to hurt her.\n\nNow, the key event is when the daughter asks if she should say her mom is her hero for the pageant. The author responds by pointing out that the step-parent and they provide for the kids, take care of them, and that it's easier for the mother to be a parent just two weekends a month. The author is frustrated that the kids don't seem to appreciate their efforts.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for expressing this frustration. \n\nFrom one angle, it's natural for a parent (or step-parent) to feel upset if they're giving a lot and not getting recognition. The author is trying to help the daughter understand the context, pointing out the differences between the two parents' involvement. However, the daughter is still a child who may not fully grasp the complexities of her parents' relationship. The author's response might come across as dismissive or critical of the mother, even if they don't intend to derogate her. But the author mentions they haven't derogated the mother directly, just highlighted the practical aspects.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's issues are well-documented. The author is trying to manage the daughter's expectations and help her see the reality of the situation. It's possible the daughter is influenced by her time with the mother, who gives her more freedom without the responsibilities that come with full-time parenting. The author's frustration stems from the imbalance in perceived parental roles and the kids' lack of appreciation for their step-parent and them.\n\nBut is the author wrong for expressing this frustration? In child custody situations, it's generally advised not to speak negatively about the other parent in front of the children, as it can complicate their relationships and create loyalty conflicts. The author's response might be seen as undermining the mother's image, even if indirectly. However, the author is also trying to be truthful and help the daughter make an informed choice, not out of malice but from a place of feeling undervalued.\n\nSo, the key factors are: the mother's history, the author's role as a caregiver, the daughter's question, and the author's response. The author's intention was to guide the daughter but also to highlight their own contributions. While the author's actions might be seen as justified given the context, there's a risk in how the message is received by the daughter. However, the author hasn't directly insulted the mother, just explained the differences in parenting styles and responsibilities.\n\nConsidering all this, it's a nuanced situation. The author's frustration is understandable, and their approach might be seen as trying to balance the daughter's admiration for her mother with the reality of the author's contributions. But they need to be careful not to alienate the daughter from her mother. However, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their feelings in this context, as they are trying to be honest and help the daughter make a decision that reflects the family's situation.\n"
