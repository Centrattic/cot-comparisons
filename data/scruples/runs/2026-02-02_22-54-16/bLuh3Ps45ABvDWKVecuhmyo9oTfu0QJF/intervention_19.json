She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for resenting that their children see their mom as a hero, given the context.\n\nFirst, the author's ex-wife (the children's mother) has a history of issues: jail, affairs, job losses, living with her mom. The author was a single dad for three years, handling everything from braiding hair to providing for their needs, now remarried and providing for the kids. They even pay for healthcare, activities, braces, etc. The stepmom is mentioned as part of the supportive family. The author isn't asking for child support because the mother can't support herself and he's forgiven her.\n\nNow, the daughter is in a pageant and asks if she should name her mom as a hero. The author responds by pointing out that they provide for her, that the mother only sees the kids every other weekend with no chores, and that being a parent all the time is harder. The author isn't derogatory but is frustrated that the kids see the mother as an angel and don't appreciate their stepfamily's efforts.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The question is about resentment and whether the response was appropriate. The author's actions show they are providing for the kids, trying to be fair (not asking for support), and trying to help the daughter think critically about her mother's role. The response to the daughter seems to be a calm explanation of the situation, not belittling the mother. The author's frustration is justified given the mother's history and the stepfamily's sacrifices. The key points are that the author is trying to balance the kids' perception without being negative but is frustrated when their efforts aren't recognized. The answer would likely be B, not in the wrong, because they are advocating for their role and trying to be fair while pointing out the reality of the mother's situation.\n"
