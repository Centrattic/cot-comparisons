She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a stepdad who's providing for his ex-wife's children, but the kids still look up to their mother, who has a history of problematic behavior.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the ex-wife has multiple issues: jail time, affairs, job instability, and living with her mom. The stepdad and his new wife have been the primary caregivers, taking care of the kids' needs like healthcare, school, activities, and even planning to buy a car for the son. They don't ask for child support because the mother can't support herself.\n\nThe conflict arises when the daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should name her mother as her hero. The stepdad responds by pointing out that the mother only sees the kids two weekends a month and that being a parent full-time is harder than part-time. He doesn't want to badmouth the mother but is frustrated that the kids don't appreciate what they have with their stepfamily.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The stepdad's actions seem to stem from a place of frustration. He's providing the kids with everything, but they still idolize their mother, who hasn't been consistent in her parenting. His response to the daughter is an attempt to explain the disparity without directly criticizing the mother. However, he might be trying to influence the child's perception, which could be seen as manipulative. \n\nBut given the mother's history, is the stepdad wrong to feel that the kids should recognize the stepfamily's efforts? He's not forcing them to change their opinion but is pointing out the reality. On the other hand, the children have a right to maintain a relationship with their biological mother, even if she's not a perfect parent. The stepdad's frustration is valid, but his approach might be seen as undermining the mother's role, even if indirectly.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a bit of a gray area. The stepdad isn't actively harming the kids, but he's expressing his resentment. However, he's also being honest about the situation. The key point is whether his comments are fair or if they cross into trying to sway the children against their mother's better judgment. Since the mother has a documented history of neglect and the stepdad is providing for the kids, his frustration is understandable. He's not in a position to dictate the kids' feelings but is expressing his own feelings of being unappreciated. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because he's addressing his feelings without attacking the mother directly, even though he's frustrated. His response is more about explaining the situation to the daughter rather than forcing her to change her answer. So, the answer should be B.\n"
