She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the user is asking for an opinion on whether the person who wrote the situation is at fault for resenting that their children see their ex-wife as a hero. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The author is a father who was married to someone he describes as a problematic ex-wife. The ex has been in jail, had affairs, lost jobs, and currently lives with her mom. He was a single dad for three years, taking care of their three kids, even learning to braid hair. He's now remarried, and his current wife and he provide everything for the kids: healthcare, school help, activities, even future things like a car for the son and braces for the daughter. He doesn't ask for child support from the ex because she can't support herself. He's forgiven her, but he's frustrated when his daughter mentions their mom as a hero. He responded to the daughter's question about the pageant answer by pointing out the ex's lack of responsibilities and their own efforts as parents.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are the author's frustration with the children idolizing their mother despite her shortcomings. He's providing for them, but the kids seem to value the other parent, who isn't contributing. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the ex isn't providing child support, which is expected. The author isn't asking for it, which is generous. But the children are allowed to have a relationship with their mom. The father is trying to explain to his daughter that their stepmother and he are the ones providing consistently. However, he's not directly criticizing the mother in front of the kids; he's more highlighting their own efforts. \n\nBut is it wrong to feel resentful? Emotionally, the father is dealing with the stress of being a single parent and now a step-parent. His frustration might be valid, but how he handles it could be the issue. The daughter is preparing for a pageant, and she's considering who to name as her hero. The father's response is trying to guide her to recognize their care, but he's also reminding her of the ex's lack of contribution. \n\nThe problem might be that the father is trying to influence the child's answer to devalue the other parent, even if implicitly. The child is in a position where she's supposed to choose a hero, and the father is essentially saying, \"You should see us as the real heroes because we take care of you, while your mom doesn't.\" However, the child might genuinely admire the mother for other reasons, maybe because she's more available or gives more attention during her visits. \n\nIn terms of parental rights, both parents are allowed to have a relationship with their children unless there's a court order. The father might be projecting his own resentment onto the children, expecting them to share his negative view of their mother. The children have the right to form their own opinions about their parents. \n\nIs the father in the wrong? It depends on how the actions are perceived. If he's not directly belittling the ex-wife, maybe it's not wrong. But if he's trying to manipulate the child's perception, that could be problematic. The father's frustration is understandable, but he needs to respect the children's ability to have their own feelings towards their mother. Even if the ex is not a good parent, the children can still have a positive relationship with her for various reasons. \n\nSo, the father might not be in the wrong for feeling resentful, but he might need to adjust his approach to avoid making the child choose sides. However, the way he's responding to the daughter's question might be influencing her answer rather than allowing her to make her own choice. The key is whether he's directly putting down the mother or just highlighting their own contributions. The answer seems to lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he's expressing his feelings and trying to guide the child's perception based on his experiences, but it's a close call. However, since he's not outright derogatory, maybe the answer is B.\n"
