She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeling resentful about his kids seeing their mother as a hero despite her issues, and him being the one providing for them now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation more clearly. The author's ex-wife has a lot of problems: jail, affairs, job loss, living with her mom. He was a single dad for three years, and now he's remarried. His current wife helps take care of the kids, they provide everything, pay for healthcare, activities, even a car for the son and braces for the daughter. He doesn't ask for child support because the ex can't support herself. He's forgiven her but is frustrated when the daughter asks about saying the ex-mom is a hero. He responds by pointing out that they live with him full-time, he provides for them, while with their mom it's easier because she doesn't have to do much and uses food stamps.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The key points here are about the parent's feelings of resentment and how he expressed it to his daughter. He didn't directly criticize the ex-wife but tried to explain the situation. He wants the kids to appreciate what their stepmother and he do for them but is upset they see their mom as a hero.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, children often maintain a positive image of both parents, especially when one parent is the custodial parent. Even if the other parent has issues, kids might not see those because they spend less time with them. The father is correct in pointing out the disparity in care. However, the way he expressed his feelings might come off as trying to undermine the mother's image, even if he didn't directly criticize her. It's possible that he's projecting his resentment and frustration onto the child, which isn't ideal.\n\nBut he didn't badmouth the mother. He focused on the fact that they live with him and he's the one providing everything. He's trying to manage the child's perception by explaining the reality. However, it's important to consider the child's emotional well-being. The child might feel conflicted if they are being subtly encouraged to devalue their mother. Even if she's problematic, the child's positive feelings towards her are natural, especially if she's the biological mother.\n\nThe father's frustration is valid given the sacrifices he's made. However, the approach to addressing it might be problematic. Instead of comparing the two parents, maybe a better approach would be to discuss the importance of family and the roles each person plays without denigrating the other parent. The key is whether his actions are harmful to the child's relationship with their mother. If he's being honest without being malicious, perhaps there's a middle ground here.\n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The father's feelings are understandable, but the way he's handling it could be seen as trying to manipulate the child's perception. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes) or B (no). Considering he didn't directly criticize the mother and was trying to highlight the care he and his wife provide, maybe it's not wrong. But if the approach is undermining the mother's role in the child's eyes, then maybe he's in the wrong.\n\nAlternatively, the father is just expressing his feelings and the reality of the situation. The child is asking for advice, and he's giving his perspective. It's important for the child to understand the contributions of the stepmother and him, but also to maintain a positive relationship with the mother if possible. The father's frustration is valid, but maybe he should focus on his own feelings without trying to change the child's perception, as that could create conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he's expressing his legitimate feelings and providing context, but there's a potential for causing conflict. However, since he's not directly badmouthing the mother and is trying to manage the situation, it's a bit of a toss-up. But given the options, the answer is likely B.\n"
