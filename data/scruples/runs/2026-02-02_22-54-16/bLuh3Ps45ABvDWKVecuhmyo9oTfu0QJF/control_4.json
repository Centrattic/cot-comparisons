She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a father who's dealing with his children idolizing their mother despite her history of issues. The dad has a lot of responsibilities as a single parent and now stepdad, and he's frustrated that the kids don't see him and his wife as heroes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the father's perspective. He's been a single dad for three years, handling everything from childcare to financial support. He's remarried and the stepmother is involved in their lives, providing for their needs. He forgoes child support because the ex can't afford it. He's trying to protect the ex's feelings but is clearly frustrated.\n\nNow, the daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should say her mom is her hero. The father responds by pointing out that they live with him and his wife, who provide for them, and that their mom only sees them part-time. He's not directly put-down the ex but is highlighting the stepfamily's contributions.\n\nIs he wrong? Well, he's not directly criticizing the ex in front of the kids, but he's contrasting the support they receive from him and his wife against the mother's limited involvement. The question is whether this approach is appropriate. Some might argue that he's valid in feeling frustrated and trying to assert his role as their primary caregiver. However, others might say that comparing the two parents in this context could be harmful to the kids' perception of their mother, even if the ex is flawed.\n\nThe father says he doesn't want to hurt the ex and has forgiven her. But his response to the daughter might inadvertently undermine the mother in the kids' eyes. Even if the mother isn't a good parent, the father's approach could be seen as trying to influence the children's opinions, which might not be healthy for their relationship with their mother.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a gray area. The father has legitimate feelings of being taken for granted, but how he expresses those feelings could affect the children's views. The key is whether he's being fair in his comparison. He's pointing out facts about their living situation and support, but framing it as \"it's harder to be a parent all the time\" might make the kids feel like the mother isn't a good parent, even if she's only part of their lives now.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. He's not outright abusive or malicious, but his actions might be undermining the mother's role. However, given the mother's history, some might argue that the father is just being realistic. The answer could depend on cultural or personal beliefs about co-parenting dynamics. But in terms of being wrong, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong because he's expressing his feelings in a way he thinks is justified. On the other hand, the way he's handling the situation might be harmful to the kids' relationships with their mother. \n\nI think the answer here is a bit nuanced. The father's feelings are valid, but his approach might not be the healthiest. However, since he's not directly criticizing the mother but pointing out the facts, he might not be in the wrong. So the answer could be B (No), but I'm a bit conflicted. The question is whether he's wrong in resenting their view of the mother as a hero. If the mother is indeed problematic, then the father's resentment is understandable. But if he's trying to make the kids choose between parents, that's problematic. The father's response seems to be more about clarifying the support they receive rather than badmouthing the mother. So maybe B is the correct answer here.\n"
