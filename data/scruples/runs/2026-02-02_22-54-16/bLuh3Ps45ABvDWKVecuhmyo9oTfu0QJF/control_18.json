She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person is a father who was divorced from their ex-wife, who they describe as having a lot of issues\u2014jail time, affairs, job losses, and currently living with her mom. He took on being a single dad for three years, and now he's remarried. His new wife and he provide everything for the kids: healthcare, school help, activities, etc. They even plan to buy his son a car and pay for his daughter's braces. He doesn't ask for child support because the ex can't support herself, and he's forgiven her.\n\nThe conflict arises when his daughter, who they've raised full-time, is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should say her mom (the ex) is her hero. He responds by pointing out that they provide everything, they're the ones who care for her full-time, and that being a parent part-time is easier. He's frustrated that the kids see their ex-mom as a hero despite all the problems.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me think about the key points here.\n\nFirst, the father's response to the daughter. He didn't directly criticize the ex-wife, but he did imply that the ex isn't doing much and that he and his stepmom are the real caregivers. The daughter is influenced by her time with both parents. Since the ex sees the kids every other weekend and the father's family is the primary caregivers, it's understandable that the daughter might have mixed feelings. But the father is expressing frustration that the kids idealize the ex despite her many issues.\n\nIs it wrong to express that frustration? Well, he didn't attack the ex-wife in front of the kids, but he did highlight the disparities in their situations. However, the daughter is in a position where she's trying to form her own opinion, and the father is trying to guide her to appreciate their role. It's a delicate balance between being honest about the reality and not undermining the other parent, which he claims he hasn't done.\n\nBut he's not forbidding the daughter from choosing her mom as a hero, just pointing out the facts. The key here is whether his response was appropriate. The father is doing the right thing by providing for the kids, and his frustration is valid. However, he should consider that the daughter might have a different perspective based on her time with her mom. Even if the ex is problematic, the daughter might see her differently because of the time she spends with her, even if it's less frequent.\n\nIn terms of parenting, it's generally advised to avoid badmouthing the other parent in front of the children, even if they have issues. The father's response is more about explaining the situation rather than belittling the ex, which is a gray area. But he's not outright disparaging the ex, just making the daughter aware of the full context. So maybe he's not in the wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, if the ex is indeed a problematic parent, but the kids still see her as a hero because she's more permissive or because she's not holding them to the same standards, the father might feel justified in pointing that out. The stepmother and he are providing a stable, supportive environment, and the daughter's admiration for the ex could lead to resentment or confusion.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the father's response was appropriate. Since he didn't attack the ex directly and instead explained the realities of their situations, he might not be in the wrong. However, if he's subtly undermining the ex's role without valid cause, that could be an issue. But given the ex's history as described, his explanation is factual and not malicious. Therefore, the father is probably not in the wrong here. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
