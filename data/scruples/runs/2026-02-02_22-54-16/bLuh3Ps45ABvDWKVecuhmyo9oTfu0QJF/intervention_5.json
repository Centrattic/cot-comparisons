She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person is a step-parent who's been taking care of their three kids after the mom was a problematic parent. The ex-wife has issues like jail time, affairs, job losses, and lives with her mom. The author, as a single dad for three years, has handled a lot, even learning to braid hair. Now, they have a stepmom who supports the kids financially and emotionally, doing all the work. They don't ask for child support because the mother can't support herself. The author says they've forgiven her.\n\nThen, the daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should say her mom is her hero. The author responds by pointing out that the step-family provides everything, the kids live with them full-time, and that being a parent part-time is easier than full-time. The author isn't badmouthing the mother but is frustrated that the kids see her as an angel and don't appreciate the stepmom and their efforts.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong but is asking for confirmation. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the situation. The author is a step-parent who is providing a lot for the kids. The biological mother isn't contributing financially (no child support) and has a history of issues. The author's frustration is about the kids' perception of their mother as a hero, given the mother's lack of consistent support. The author's response to the daughter was to explain the difference in the parenting roles but didn't directly criticize the mother. They tried to reason with the child about where they live and the care they receive.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, in terms of the interaction with the daughter, the author didn't lash out or insult the mother. They explained their perspective. The key here is that they're trying to help the child understand the reality of their living situation without badmouthing the mother. That seems reasonable. The author is trying to balance their own frustrations without harming the child's relationship with the mother, even though they don't ask for support.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is being manipulative or trying to influence the child's opinion of their mother. However, the author is not outright lying or defaming; they are presenting facts about their living situation. The child is old enough to understand that different family members contribute differently. The author's frustration is valid given the effort they and the stepmom put in, and the mother's lack of support. \n\nThe author's approach seems appropriate. They are trying to guide the child to recognize the support they receive without being negative. It's about perspective. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because they are being honest with the child about their circumstances and their efforts without attacking the mother. They also have a history of not seeking child support, so they're not trying to financially pressure the mother. The frustration is about the kids' perception, which is a fair issue to address without being wrong.\n"
