She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me start by reading through the details again carefully. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question (the author) is in the wrong for resenting that their children see their mom as a hero. The ex-wife is described as having a troubled history: jail, affairs, job losses, and living with her mom. The author has been a single dad for three years, then remarried, and now they take care of the kids financially and emotionally. The stepmom and the author provide everything the kids need\u2014healthcare, activities, school help, even future plans like a car and braces. The author doesn't ask for child support because the ex can't support herself, and they forgive her. \n\nThe conflict arises when the daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should say her mom is her hero. The author responds by pointing out that the stepmom and they provide for the kids all the time, while the biological mom only sees the kids every other weekend with no chores and uses food stamps. The author is frustrated that the kids view the mom as an angel and not appreciating what their stepmom and him do.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author in the wrong? A for yes, B for no.\n\nLet me break this down. The author is a step-parent who has taken on significant responsibility, providing for the children's needs, while the ex-wife has a problematic history and is not contributing financially. The author's frustration stems from the children idolizing the mom despite her shortcomings, which makes the author feel unappreciated. The key issue is whether the author overstepped by directly pointing out the mother's situation to the daughter in response to the hero question.\n\nIn family dynamics, especially co-parenting situations, it's generally advised not to badmouth the other parent in front of the children. Even if the parent has issues, the step-parent should avoid undermining the biological parent's image if possible. However, the author did not outright insult the mother but rather highlighted the contrast between the two households. The author explains the effort they put in versus the mother's ability to provide. The daughter then seems to understand the situation, as she asks if she should mention her mom, implying she's aware of the circumstances. \n\nThe author's response was in a private conversation, not in front of others or the ex-wife. The frustration is valid because the author feels unappreciated, but the way they addressed it might have been inappropriate. The line between expressing frustration and undermining the other parent can be thin. However, the author's intent was not to derogate the mom, as they state they've never done that and don't want to hurt her. They want the kids to appreciate their efforts without damaging the children's perception of their mom.\n\nIn such cases, professionals often advise step-parents to focus on their own role and not compare themselves to the other parent. However, the author's response was a direct reaction to the daughter's question, which might be a natural way to help the daughter think critically. Still, it's possible that the author's frustration led them to compare the two household situations, which could be seen as underhanded. \n\nBut considering the context: the ex is struggling, the author is providing, the kids see her as a hero despite her issues. The author's comment is factual but highlights disparities. The daughter is old enough (8 years old) to understand the situation, but maybe the author should have handled it differently. For example, encouraging the daughter to think about what makes a hero, rather than comparing the two households. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as justified in wanting the children to recognize their support, but the method could be questionable. However, since the author didn't outright insult the mother and was being honest about their situation, it's a nuanced case. The key factors are the ex's lack of support, the author's positive contributions, and the directness of the response. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's frustration is valid, directly pointing out the mother's shortcomings in a way that contrasts with their own might be crossing a line. However, since the author's intent was not to derogate but to help the daughter understand the context, it's a tough call. But the general advice is to avoid such comparisons. Therefore, the answer might be A (in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). Given the circumstances, the author's frustration is understandable, but their approach might not be the best. However, since they didn't directly insult and were explaining their perspective, maybe it's a B. Alternatively, the act of highlighting the contrast could still be considered wrong. Hmm.\n"
