She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for resenting that their children see their ex-wife (the children's mother) as a hero, despite the mother's problematic history. The author is a step-parent who provides for the children financially and emotionally, yet the kids idealize the mother who isn't present and has a history of failures. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author is frustrated because the children don't acknowledge their step-parent's efforts and instead look up to the mother who isn't around much. But is the author in the wrong for expressing this frustration? They didn't directly criticize the mother to the kids, just pointed out the contrast in their conversation about the pageant question.\n\nThe mother has issues\u2014jail, affairs, etc.\u2014but the children might not know the full story. The author is trying not to harm the children's image of their mother, which is a good point. However, the frustration is valid because they're the ones providing all the support. The key is whether the author overstepped by mentioning the other parent's shortcomings in a way that could make the kids feel disloyal or upset. \n\nThe author's response to the daughter was a bit of a comparison, highlighting their own role versus the mother's. It's possible this could make the child feel conflicted. But since the author is a step-parent, they don't have the same inherent authority as a biological parent. Maybe the right approach is to encourage the child to choose her own hero without pressure, rather than pointing out the differences. \n\nHowever, the author's intention wasn't to badmouth the mother but to express their own feelings of being undervalued. It's a delicate situation where the step-parent's contributions might be overlooked. The author's frustration is understandable, but perhaps the way they addressed it wasn't the best. \n\nStill, they didn't explicitly criticize the mother in front of the child, which is important. They're trying to balance their emotions with the child's relationship with her mother. The question is whether the author's approach is wrong. Since they were responding to the child's question and trying to explain their perspective, it's more of a communication issue rather than being in the wrong. \n\nSo, after considering all angles, I think the answer is B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong. Their frustration is valid, and they're trying to navigate a tough situation without harming the child's relationship with their mother. The main issue is how to handle the resentment, but not being in the wrong overall.\n"
