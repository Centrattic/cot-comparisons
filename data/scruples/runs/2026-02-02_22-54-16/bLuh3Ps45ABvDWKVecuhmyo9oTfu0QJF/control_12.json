She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a man who's a single dad now remarried, providing for his kids, while their mom has a troubled history. The kids still see their mom as a hero, and he's frustrated because they don't appreciate what he and his stepmom do. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The ex-wife has a lot of issues: jail, affairs, job losses, lives with her mom. The stepdad has been taking care of the kids for three years, including things like braiding hair, paying for healthcare, activities, even a future car and braces. He doesn't ask for child support because she can't support herself. Then, when the daughter is preparing for a pageant, the daughter asks if she should say her mom is her hero. The stepdad responds by pointing out that they live with him, he provides for them, and their mom only sees them two weekends a month without responsibilities. He's frustrated they see their mom as an angel.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the ethics here. The stepdad is providing a lot for the kids, but he's also making a comparison between his role and their biological mother's. The daughter is asking for advice on her hero, and the stepdad's response is critical of the mother, even if he says he's not derogatory. He's pointing out the mother's lack of responsibility compared to his own. \n\nIs it wrong to express frustration in that context? Well, the father is trying to help his daughter think about the situation, but the daughter might be influenced by his comments to view her mother negatively. The ex has a history of being absent, but she's their biological mother, and the kids might naturally have a positive image of her, especially if they see her as present during their visits, even if she's not doing much. \n\nThe stepdad's actions are about providing for them, but the kids might not realize the effort involved. However, in the moment of the daughter asking about her hero, the stepdad's response is more about correcting their perspective rather than just advising. He's highlighting his own sacrifices and the mother's shortcomings. That could be seen as undermining the mother in front of the child, even if he's not outright badmouthing her. \n\nOn the other hand, the stepdad isn't asking for anything and has a right to feel unappreciated. The mother isn't contributing, so it's understandable he's frustrated. But the way he's addressing the daughter's question might be inappropriate because it's using the child as a medium to criticize the mother. Even if he's not harsh, the child might feel conflicted between the two parents.\n\nThe line between expressing one's feelings and undermining another parent can be thin. In custody situations, it's generally advised to avoid speaking negatively about the other parent in front of the kids to prevent them from feeling caught in the middle. The stepdad's response might be doing that, making the daughter question her mother's role and possibly causing internal conflict.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? He's not directly abusive or cruel, but his approach could harm the child's relationship with the mother. The key is whether he should have addressed the daughter's question without comparing their respective roles. Maybe he should have focused on the daughter's own feelings and motivations rather than contrasting his and the mother's contributions. \n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because he's using the child's question to express his frustration about the mother's role, potentially influencing the child's perception negatively, even if his intentions are good.\n"
