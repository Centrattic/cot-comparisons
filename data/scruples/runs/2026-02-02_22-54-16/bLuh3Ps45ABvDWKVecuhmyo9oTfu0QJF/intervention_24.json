She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a guy who's a stepdad now, and he's taking care of his kids full-time. His ex-wife is described as having a lot of issues: jail time, affairs, lost jobs, living with her mom, etc. He's doing all the parenting stuff, paying for everything, and he doesn't ask for child support because she can't support herself. He's forgiven her, but he's frustrated that his kids look up to his ex as a hero instead of appreciating what he and his wife do.\n\nThe key moment is when his daughter asks if she should say her mom is her hero for a pageant. The dad responds by pointing out that they live with him, he provides for them, and that their mom only sees them two weekends a month with fewer responsibilities. He's trying not to badmouth the mom but is clearly frustrated.\n\nSo, the question is whether the dad is in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, he's trying to make the kids aware of the reality of their mom's situation. He's highlighting the contrast between the stepmom's (his wife's) role and the ex's role. He's not directly insulting the ex, but he's making a comparative statement that could make the kids question their mom's role. On the other hand, he's the one providing for the kids, and he's trying to manage their perceptions without being negative.\n\nBut is he wrong to express his frustration? The dad is trying to balance his own feelings with not wanting to damage the kids' view of their mother. He's not forbidding them from having a positive image of their mom, but he's pointing out that their mom's situation is different. It's a delicate situation because kids often idealize non-custodial parents, especially if they have less responsibility. The dad is trying to correct that imbalance by showing the effort he and his wife put in.\n\nHowever, maybe he overstepped by bringing up the comparison in a way that could make the kids feel conflicted. Even though he's trying not to badmouth the mom, his comments might inadvertently undermine her in the kids' eyes. Also, he's the one who's providing the support, so his frustration is understandable. But is it his place to correct their perception of their mom, or should he let the kids form their own opinions based on their experiences?\n\nAnother angle is that he's not being negative about the ex per se, just pointing out the facts. He's explaining that being a parent 24/7 is different from being a parent part-time. That's a valid point. However, the way he frames it might be making the kids compare their mom to the stepmom, which could be confusing. Also, mentioning things like food stamps might be too detailed for the kids to process.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's tricky. He's trying to be fair and not badmouth the ex, but his frustration is leading him to highlight the differences in parental roles. The kids' perception of their mom as a hero could be due to her being less involved, which sometimes makes non-custodial parents seem more idealized. The dad is trying to counter that by showing the reality of his own role. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he's not being aggressive or abusive. He's just expressing his feelings in a situation where he's doing a lot. However, he's the custodial parent, and he's trying to influence the kids' perception of the non-custodial parent. There's a line between explaining the situation and manipulating their views. But in this case, he's not forcing them to change their view, just pointing out the facts. \n\nI think the key here is whether the dad's actions are harmful. Since he's not directly criticizing the mom, just explaining the differences in their roles, it's more about perspective. The answer might be that he's not in the wrong because he's trying to balance his feelings without being negative. But some might argue that he should let the kids form their own opinions without influencing them. However, given that he's the one providing care, it's reasonable for him to want the kids to recognize the support he and his wife offer. \n\nSo, the answer is B, he's not in the wrong. He's trying to navigate a complicated situation without being negative, while managing his own frustrations.\n"
