She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a single dad who's taken care of his kids after a difficult divorce, and now he's upset that the kids see their mom as a hero despite her issues. He's trying to explain to his daughter that the stepmom and he do a lot for her, but the daughter is still considering her biological mom as her hero.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The dad is doing a lot for the kids, providing financially and emotionally. The ex is clearly problematic with her history. The dad is frustrated but hasn't directly criticized the mom, just trying to help the daughter understand the support they provide. When the daughter asks if she should say her mom is her hero, the dad points out that the stepmom and he take care of her full-time, while the biological mom only sees them every other weekend. \n\nIs there something wrong with his approach? He's not saying the mom is bad, just explaining the effort they put in. He's not belittling the mom but trying to balance the daughter's perspective. The key here is whether his response was unfair or harmful. Since he's not attacking the mother directly but highlighting his own and his wife's contributions, it seems reasonable. The daughter is in a position where she's influenced by her time with each parent. The dad's frustration is valid because he's the one providing the majority of care and resources. \n\nOn the other hand, the daughter's admiration for her mom might be because of the less demanding environment. But the dad's response is about making the daughter aware of the support she receives. He's not trying to damage the daughter's relationship with her mom, just expressing his feelings of being undervalued. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Probably not. He's addressing the situation honestly without attacking the mother, just emphasizing their sacrifices. The answer should be B (No).\n"
