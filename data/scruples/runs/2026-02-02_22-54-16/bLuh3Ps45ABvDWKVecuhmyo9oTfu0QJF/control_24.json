She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent (the author) who's dealing with their children idolizing their ex-wife/mother despite her numerous issues. The author has been the primary caregiver for three years, providing for the kids, and now feels resentful because the kids see their mother as a hero.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The ex-wife has a problematic history\u2014jail time, affairs, job instability, and living with her mom. The author, as a single dad and now remarried, is handling all the responsibilities and financial support. The daughter is asking if she should name her mom as her hero for a pageant. The author's response was to explain the differences in living arrangements and parenting efforts between the two households.\n\nThe key question is whether the author's response was wrong. The user wants a yes (A) or no (B). The author didn't directly criticize the ex-wife but pointed out the contrast in parental responsibilities. The author also mentions not wanting to hurt the ex-wife and having forgiven her. However, the frustration is about the kids not appreciating their current caregivers. \n\nPossible angles: Is it wrong to express frustration in this context? The author is trying to manage the kids' expectations and their own feelings without badmouthing the ex-wife. The response might be seen as trying to correct the children's skewed perception based on their mother's shortcomings. But does this come across as undermining the mother? The author's approach was to highlight the reality rather than directly belittle the mother. \n\nAlso, considering child welfare, the author is ensuring the kids have everything they need. The resentment comes from the kids' admiration for a parent who isn't providing consistent care. The author's response might be seen as necessary to balance the children's perceptions. However, if the author is being dismissive of the biological mother's role, that could be problematic. But in this case, the author acknowledges the mother's presence and the limited time the kids spend with her.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is not encouraging the kids to disrespect their mother but is helping them understand the realities of both households. The author's frustration is valid given the circumstances. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is addressing the children's potential bias without directly attacking the ex-wife, instead emphasizing the effort and resources they provide.\n"
