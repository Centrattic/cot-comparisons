She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy is a stepfather who's taking care of the kids, providing everything they need, while the mother is described as having a problematic history. The kids still see her as a hero, and the stepfather feels resentful about that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The stepfather is doing a lot for the kids\u2014paying for healthcare, activities, school stuff, even a car for the son. The mother is their biological mom but has issues: jail time, affairs, can't support herself, etc. He's not asking for child support. Now, when the daughter asks about the pageant question about a hero, the stepfather responds by pointing out the reality of their mom's situation, highlighting that their stepfamily provides for them full-time. He doesn't want to badmouth the mother but feels frustrated.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong. The question is whether he's in the wrong. So, I need to weigh the dynamics here. On one hand, the stepfather is a caregiver who's contributing a lot. On the other hand, the kids have the right to have their own opinions about their biological mother, even if she's not the ideal parent. The stepfather's frustration is understandable, but how he handles it could matter.\n\nThe stepfather's response to the daughter: he's pointing out the facts, not directly putting down the mother, but comparing the support from his family versus the mother's. He's trying to make the daughter aware of the reality. But does that make him in the wrong? Well, he's being honest about his feelings, and he's not lying. The problem is if he's trying to undermine the mother's image, but the user says he hasn't derogated her. However, the daughter's admiration for the mother is a personal choice, and the stepfather's frustration might not be the child's fault. Kids often idealize parents who aren't present all the time, especially if they have a better experience with them when they do see them.\n\nIs it fair for the stepfather to feel resentful? Yes, because he's doing a lot, and the mother isn't contributing. But is he in the wrong for expressing his feelings in this way? If he's not actively trying to harm the daughter's perception but is just voicing his own frustrations, maybe not. However, if he's trying to influence the daughter's answer to the pageant question in a way that undermines the mother, that could be problematic. But in this case, he's just explaining the differences in their living situations and contributions. He's not forcing the daughter to choose, just giving her context.\n\nAlso, the mother's situation is complicated. The stepfather is not asking for child support, which is a kind gesture, but it's also a valid point that the mother isn't contributing. The stepfather's role as a stepfather is to support the kids, which he's doing, but the kids' relationship with their biological mother is separate. They might still admire her for reasons unrelated to her actual behavior, like she's more lenient or present when she can be.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the stepfather's feelings are valid, but he needs to navigate them carefully. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether his actions (expressing frustration to the daughter) cross a line. Since he's not attacking the mother directly and is just stating facts, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the stepfather is trying to influence the daughter's perception, that could be an issue. However, in this case, he's responding to her question with his perspective, which is acceptable. The daughter can form her own opinion based on that information.\n\nSo, considering all that, the stepfather isn't in the wrong. He's expressing his feelings appropriately and providing context. The answer is B.\n"
