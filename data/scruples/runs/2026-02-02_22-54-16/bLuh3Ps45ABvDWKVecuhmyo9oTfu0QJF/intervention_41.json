She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a dad who's been a single parent for three years, taking care of three kids. He's remarried, and his new wife is helping a lot. They provide for the kids financially and emotionally. The ex-wife, on the other hand, has a troubled background\u2014jail, affairs, job issues, and lives with her mom. He doesn't ask for child support because she can't support herself.\n\nNow, the daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should say her mom is her hero. The dad responds by pointing out that they provide for her and that the mom only sees the kids sporadically. He's frustrated that the kids see their ex-mom as a hero despite the ex's issues.\n\nThe user is asking if the dad is in the wrong. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dad's intentions. He didn't directly criticize the ex-wife, but he did highlight the contrast between what he and his wife do versus the ex's limited role. He wants the kids to appreciate their current family's efforts. However, he's concerned about the kids' perception of their mother. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's tricky. On one hand, the dad is trying to balance honesty with not wanting to damage the kids' relationship with their mom. On the other hand, maybe he's subtly undermining the ex by pointing out the differences between the two parents. But he's not badmouthing her, just explaining the situation. \n\nThe kids living with him full-time and the ex having limited contact might mean the ex isn't around to do the day-to-day parenting. The dad is doing the bulk of the work. It's natural to feel frustrated if the kids idolize the parent who's not providing the same level of care. However, it's also important for children to maintain a relationship with both parents, even if one is flawed. \n\nThe dad's response to the daughter was direct but maybe not overly harsh. He's trying to guide her to consider the reality of their mother's role. He's not forcing her to say anything but is pointing out the facts. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's more about the dad's approach. He might not be in the wrong because he's managing the situation without attacking the ex-wife directly. However, he could be doing more to encourage the kids to appreciate the other parent without creating resentment. But since he's not directly criticizing her, maybe he's justified in his frustration. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). He's trying to balance his own feelings with the well-being of the kids, and his approach seems reasonable given the circumstances.\n"
