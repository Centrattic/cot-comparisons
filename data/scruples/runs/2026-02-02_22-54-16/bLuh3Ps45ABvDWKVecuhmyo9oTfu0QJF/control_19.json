She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the A$$hole) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author is a stepfather who's taken on the role of a parent after his ex-wife, who he describes as having a troubled history with jail, affairs, job losses, and currently living with her mom. He's been a single dad for three years, remarried, and now he and his wife provide for their three kids. They cover healthcare, school activities, projects, even future expenses like a car and braces. He doesn't ask for child support because the ex can't support herself.\n\nThe conflict arises when his daughter asks if she should say her biological mom is her hero for a pageant. The author responds by pointing out that the kids live with them full-time, they provide everything, and their mom only sees them every other weekend with no chores and food stamps. He's frustrated that the kids see their mom as a hero despite her shortcomings.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are his tone and approach. He didn't directly criticize the ex-wife but highlighted the disparity in their living situations. He's trying to make the daughter aware of the reality, maybe to help her make a more informed choice. However, the daughter is in a position where she's supposed to choose a hero, and the author is subtly undermining the mother's role. \n\nBut the author hasn't been negative towards the ex-wife; he's just giving factual information. He's not forcing the daughter's hand, just offering a perspective. He's providing context about the different living arrangements. It's possible that the daughter might still choose her mom, but the author is expressing his frustration. \n\nThe line between guiding and manipulating might be thin here. However, the author's actions are motivated by his desire to be recognized for his efforts and to highlight the reality of the situation. The ex's role as a parent is minimal compared to the stepfamily's full-time support. \n\nIn terms of ethics, is it wrong to point out the facts? The author isn't lying; he's stating the truth about their living conditions. He's not badmouthing the ex directly but is making a comparison to help the daughter understand the context. However, it's possible that this could influence the daughter's choice, and he might be projecting his own feelings onto her. \n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is old enough (8 years old) to have her own perspective, and the author is respecting her autonomy by asking if she should pick her mom. His frustration is valid given his sacrifices, but he's trying to balance between being supportive and ensuring the daughter isn't misinformed. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He's providing honest feedback to help his daughter, not forcing her choice. He's not attacking the ex, just stating facts. His actions are about ensuring the daughter has accurate information, even if it's from his perspective. The frustration is understandable given his situation, and he's not being malicious. So, the answer is B.\n"
