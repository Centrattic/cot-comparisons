She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person (the stepparent) is in the wrong for resenting that their children see their biological mother as a hero, despite the ex's problematic behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The ex has a history of jail time, affairs, job losses, and currently lives with her mom. The stepparent and their new wife have been the primary caregivers, providing everything the kids need, including healthcare, activities, school help, even a car for the son and braces for the daughter. They don't ask for child support because the ex can't support herself. The stepparent has forgiven her but is frustrated when the daughter is asked about a hero for a pageant and considers choosing her mom.\n\nThe stepparent's response to the daughter was to point out the contrast between the two households. They mention that the daughter lives with them full-time and that the ex's parenting is easier because it's only every other weekend with no chores and food stamps. The stepparent doesn't want to derogate the mother but is frustrated.\n\nNow, the key question: Is the stepparent wrong? On one hand, they're providing a lot and feel unappreciated. They're trying to manage the daughter's expectations and acknowledge the other parent's role without badmouthing her. But on the other hand, they might be influencing the child's perception, even if subtly. The daughter is in a position where she has to choose a hero, and the stepparent is nudging her to consider their household's contributions.\n\nBut wait, the stepparent didn't outright say the mother is bad. They highlighted their own role and the mother's limitations without attacking her directly. They also mentioned they don't want to hurt the mother. The frustration comes from feeling overshadowed despite providing more support. \n\nThe line might be thin here. The stepparent is trying to balance between not badmouthing the ex and ensuring the child recognizes their support. However, by pointing out the differences in parenting styles, they might be planting seeds of comparison. But given the ex's history, the stepparent's concerns are valid. The children have two different experiences, and the stepparent is trying to make them aware of their own efforts.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the stepparent isn't forcing the daughter to choose. They presented their perspective, but the final decision is the daughter's. The stepparent is expressing their feelings of frustration, which is understandable. They haven't been actively undermining the ex mother, just explaining their own role. \n\nI think the stepparent is in the right. They're not badmouthing the ex but trying to highlight their own contributions without harming the daughter's relationship with her mother. The frustration is reasonable given the circumstances. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
