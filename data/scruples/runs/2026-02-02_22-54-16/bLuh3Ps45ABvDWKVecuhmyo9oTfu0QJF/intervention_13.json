She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who is a stepfather, feeling resentful because his children still see their birth mother as a hero despite her problematic history. He's providing for the kids financially and emotionally, but when his daughter asks about naming her mom as her hero for a pageant, he responds by highlighting the differences in their living situations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The ex-wife has a history of issues: jail, affairs, job losses, and living with her mother. The author mentions he's been a single dad for three years, handling all the care for the kids, and now with his new wife, they support the kids fully. He's not asking for child support, understanding his ex can't support herself. \n\nWhen the daughter asks about naming her mom as a hero, the author's response is about pointing out the reality of their situation. He's trying to make the daughter aware that her mom isn't the primary caregiver anymore and that they (the stepfamily) are the ones providing everything. The key point here is whether his response was appropriate. \n\nThe author didn't directly criticize the mother but explained the situation to the daughter. He's trying to balance not wanting to ruin the daughter's image of her mother while expressing his frustration. It's a delicate situation. The question is if his reaction was wrong. \n\nFrom one angle, he's trying to help the daughter understand the reality, which makes sense given the circumstances. He's not belittling the mother but pointing out facts. However, could his approach be seen as trying to manipulate the daughter's perception? Or is it a valid expression of his feelings without being harsh? \n\nAlso, the daughter is 8 years old, so the author's response might be age-appropriate. But maybe he should have handled it differently, like discussing the mother's actions without comparing the care provided. The line between guiding a child's perspective and undermining a parent is thin. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is providing context that the daughter might not be aware of. The mother's role is limited, and the stepfamily is the main support. The author's frustration is justified given the effort he and his wife put in. However, is it right to influence the child's hero choice? But the daughter was the one who brought it up, so the author's response might be a way to guide her to think critically. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's being honest about the situation without attacking the mother. He's explaining the practical aspects, not the moral character. The answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
