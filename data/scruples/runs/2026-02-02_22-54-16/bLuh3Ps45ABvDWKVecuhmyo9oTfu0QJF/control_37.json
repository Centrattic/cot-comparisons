She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a stepfather who's upset that his kids see their mom as a hero, even though he's the one providing everything. The mom has a history of issues like jail time, affairs, and job losses. The stepdad and his wife take care of the kids, pay for their needs, and he doesn't ask for child support because the mom can't support herself. \n\nThen, when the daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks about naming her mom as a hero, the stepdad responds by pointing out that the kids live with them full-time and that the mom's parenting is easier because it's only two weekends a month with no chores, etc. The stepdad doesn't want to completely ruin the kids' image of their mom but is frustrated they don't appreciate what he and his wife do.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From what I understand, when it comes to children's perception of parents, even if one parent isn't doing much, the kids might still idealize them. The stepdad is expressing frustration but not directly putting the mother down, but he did compare the two situations. \n\nThe key points here are: Did he cross a line by mentioning the mom's shortcomings in front of the kid? He didn't outright say bad things about her but pointed out the practical differences in parenting time and responsibilities. He also states he's not derogatory towards the mom. However, he's using the opportunity to subtly influence the child's perception. \n\nI think there's a balance here. While it's important for kids to have a relationship with both parents, it's also valid for the stepdad to feel unappreciated. But guiding the child to question their hero choice by comparing the two parents' roles might be seen as undermining the mother, even if indirectly. The fact that he's a stepfather might add another layer, as the kids' relationship with their biological mom is still significant. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom is indeed a \"perennial fuck up\" as described, so maybe the stepdad is justified in feeling frustrated. But children can't be expected to logically assess their parents based on circumstances; they often form emotional attachments. The stepdad's response might come off as manipulative, pushing the child to not choose the mom as a hero. \n\nI'm leaning towards saying the author is not in the wrong because he's trying to balance his feelings without being outright negative. However, he could be seen as encouraging the child to critically think about their answer, which might be appropriate. But maybe the way he framed it (pointing out the mom's shortcomings in terms of parenting effort) could be problematic. It's a tricky situation. I think the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's not directly badmouthing the mom but expressing his perspective.\n"
