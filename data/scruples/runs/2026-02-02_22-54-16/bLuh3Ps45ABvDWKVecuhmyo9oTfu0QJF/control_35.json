She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person (who is the stepfather in this scenario) is in the wrong for resenting that his children see their mother as a hero. The mother has a history of issues: jail, affairs, losing jobs, living with her mom. The stepfather is a single dad for three years, caring for three kids, now remarried, providing everything, paying for healthcare, activities, etc. He doesn't ask for child support because she can't support herself. \n\nThe conflict arises when his daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should say her mom is her hero. The stepfather responds by pointing out the mother's inconsistent parenting and the stepfamily's support. He's frustrated because the kids idealize the mother without recognizing what they do.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The stepfather is a step parent, and the kids have both parents, even though the ex-mother is not a good provider. Legally, the stepfather isn't the biological parent, so maybe he shouldn't be expected to pay for things, but he's doing it anyway. The kids are with their mother every other weekend, where they have no chores and eat with food stamps. The mother isn't contributing much, yet the kids see her as a hero.\n\nHe's trying not to badmouth their mother but is frustrated. The stepfather's response to his daughter was direct, pointing out the differences in parenting. Is that inappropriate? Well, in front of the daughter, he's contrasting his own parenting with her mother's. But he's not outright negative; he's more highlighting the reality. \n\nIs he in the wrong? The user wants a yes or no answer. Let's think about parenting roles. Step-parents often have a challenging position. The kids are legally the mother's, and the stepfather is not the biological parent. The mother's behavior is problematic, but the kids are in her custody some of the time. The stepfather is providing, but the kids still look up to their mother, which is natural. \n\nHe's expressing frustration, but did he cross a line? He didn't outright criticize the mother, but he did imply she's an easier parent. He didn't make the daughter choose, but he made a comparison. Maybe he's right to feel resentful after all he's done, but is it fair to bring up this comparison in such a direct way? It might be seen as putting the daughter in the middle of parental conflict, which is generally discouraged. However, the stepfather is trying to clarify the situation for the daughter to make an informed choice. \n\nAlternatively, the stepfather's frustration is valid given the circumstances. He's providing more care, and the mother isn't contributing. But the daughter's admiration for her mother is her own feeling. The stepfather's response might be a way to help the daughter understand the realities of both parents' roles. \n\nIn terms of morality, is the stepfather wrong? It's a gray area. He's not attacking the mother, just explaining the situation. However, in child custody situations, it's often advised not to put kids in the middle. But here, the daughter asked for advice, and he gave his perspective. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's trying to be honest and his actions are in the context of his own sacrifices. But others might say he's in the wrong because he's influencing the child's view. However, given the mother's issues and his own contributions, his frustration is understandable. The key is he's not belittling the mother directly but pointing out the facts. So I think B is the right answer here.\n"
