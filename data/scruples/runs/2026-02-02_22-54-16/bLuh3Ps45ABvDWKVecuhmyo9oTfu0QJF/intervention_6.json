She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The story is about a father who is a single parent to three kids, then remarried. His ex-wife has a troubled history\u2014jail time, affairs, lost jobs, lives with her mom. The new wife and the father provide everything for the kids: healthcare, school help, activities, even future car and braces. He doesn't ask for child support because she can't support herself. Now, the daughter is in a pageant and was asked who her hero is. The daughter considered saying the mom. The father expressed frustration that the kids see the ex as a hero despite all they do. He doesn't want to badmouth the ex but feels they don't appreciate what they do.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Answer A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The father is providing a lot for the kids, while the ex isn't contributing. It's understandable he feels resentful. He's not attacking the ex directly but is expressing his feelings to the daughter in a way that might influence her. However, he's trying to make the daughter realize the ex isn't as great by pointing out the inconsistencies. The key is whether his approach is wrong.\n\nThe father's response to the daughter was to point out that the ex only spends limited time with them, which is easier than being a full-time parent. This might be seen as trying to sway the daughter's perception. But he also mentions he forgives the ex and doesn't want to hurt her. The daughter is in a position where she's supposed to choose a hero, and the father is making a case that the ex isn't the best example despite her limited role.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he's not physically or emotionally abusive, just expressing his feelings. However, talking to a child about a parent in a negative light might be considered undermining the other parent, even if it's indirect. But the father's main point is to highlight the differences in parental roles. The daughter is old enough to understand the context, and the father is trying to help her make an informed choice rather than blindly idolizing the mother.\n\nIn terms of legal or ethical standards, generally, children should maintain a relationship with both parents unless there's abuse or neglect. The ex is not providing support, but the father is raising the kids. However, the father's ex is their biological mother, and the kids might have a bond. The father's frustration is valid, but how he's handling it could be problematic. By bringing up the mother's shortcomings, even indirectly, he's influencing the daughter's perception. This could be seen as undermining the ex, which might be considered wrong even if he's not outright negative.\n\nBut he's also trying to explain the situation to his daughter, helping her understand the reality. The line between being honest and being unfair is blurry here. The father's actions might be seen as justified because he's pointing out facts that the daughter might not be aware of. However, in family dynamics, it's often advised not to speak negatively about the other parent in front of the children, even if the parent is flawed. The father's approach could be seen as trying to correct the daughter's perception rather than letting her make her own judgment.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the answer is B, then it's because his intentions are to guide the daughter to recognize the full-time efforts of him and his wife versus the mother's limited role. But if the answer is A, it's because he's undermining the ex's role, even if indirectly, which isn't right. The key factors are whether he's being fair and honest versus manipulative. The father isn't directly badmouthing her but is contrasting the time and effort each parent puts in. That might be acceptable. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
