She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether they're being too harsh or if they have a valid reason. \n\nFirst, the user is a stepfather who's been taking care of the kids for three years, doing a lot, like paying for everything, helping with school, and even learning to braid hair. His ex-wife is described as having a problematic history\u2014jail, affairs, job losses, living with her mom. He's resentful because the kids see their mom as a hero, despite her not contributing much, and he's the one providing all the support.\n\nIn the specific incident, his daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should name her biological mother as her hero. The stepfather responds by pointing out that his family provides for her and that the real mother doesn't do much except on weekends. He doesn't want to hurt the ex-wife but is frustrated the kids don't appreciate what they have.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break down the possible angles. \n\nOn one side, the stepfather is trying to protect the kids from having an unrealistic view of their mother, especially considering her lack of contributions and problematic past. He's also feeling unappreciated for all the efforts he and his wife are making. It's understandable that he's frustrated the kids don't see him and his wife as the heroes in their lives.\n\nOn the other side, children often idealize their biological parents, which is a common psychological phenomenon. The stepfather's direct approach of pointing out the differences in parenting roles might come across as undermining the mother, even if he's not directly criticizing her. The kids are still allowed to visit their mother, and the stepfather's response could be seen as influencing their perspective, which might not be fair. Also, he's in a position where the kids live with him full-time, so it's natural for them to have more positive interactions with him and his wife.\n\nBut the key here is whether he overstepped. He didn't outright tell the daughter not to say her mom, but he did highlight the contrast between the two living situations. It's possible that by emphasizing the challenges of being a parent all the time versus part-time, he's subtly devaluing the mother's role. However, he's also trying to help the daughter think critically about her choices, which could be seen as fair. \n\nThere's also the aspect of not cutting off contact with the ex-wife. The stepfather allows the kids to see their mom every other weekend, which is good. He's not preventing the relationship, just expressing his frustration. \n\nI think the main issue is whether his response is appropriate. He didn't attack the mother directly but pointed out the practical realities. It's a delicate balance. While it's valid to feel unappreciated, the way he addressed it might not be the best approach. However, given his situation, his frustration is understandable. \n\nSo, considering all that, I'm leaning towards the answer being B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's trying to manage his feelings while still respecting the mother. But I'm a bit conflicted because influencing the child's perception might not be ideal. However, the context shows that he's made efforts to be fair and hasn't cut off the mother. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
