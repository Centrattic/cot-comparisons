She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeling resentful that their kids see their mom, the ex-wife, as a hero, despite the ex's problematic history. The author is a step-parent who's been providing for the kids, while the ex has issues like jail time, affairs, job losses, and lives with her mom. They don't ask for child support because the ex can't support herself.\n\nThe situation centers on a conversation where the daughter is prepping for a pageant and asks if she should name her mom as her hero. The author responds by pointing out that they provide for the kids, care for them full-time, and contrasts that with the ex's limited involvement. The author feels frustrated because the kids idealize the ex without acknowledging all the step-parent and biological parent do.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's reaction is justified. Resentment is a common emotion in such situations, especially when the step-parent is shouldering most of the responsibility. The author didn't directly criticize the ex but highlighted the disparity in care. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for expressing frustration in that specific conversation.\n\nThe daughter is 8 years old, so the author's response might be too complex for her to fully grasp. However, the author's intention was to guide the daughter's answer, not to demean the ex. The author mentions they don't want to hurt the ex and have forgiven her, which suggests they're trying to be fair. The frustration stems from feeling unappreciated, which is a valid emotion, especially given the sacrifices made by the author and their new spouse.\n\nBut is it wrong to express that frustration to the child? The author didn't attack the ex but pointed out the practical differences in caregiving. However, the daughter might still perceive this as undermining her mother, even if the author's intent wasn't malicious. The line between expressing one's feelings and potentially damaging the child's relationship with the other parent is thin here.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to feel frustrated. On the other, the way the frustration is expressed might affect the child's perception. The author's response could be seen as manipulative, subtly pushing the child to not idealize the other parent. But since the author is the primary caregiver, their perspective is valid. The question is whether the method of communication was appropriate.\n\nIn custody situations, it's generally advised not to badmouth the other parent to the children. The author didn't outright badmouth but highlighted the ex's shortcomings in comparison. This could still be seen as undermining. However, the author's main point was about the effort involved in being a full-time parent versus part-time. The answer hinges on whether the author crossed the line into damaging the child's relationship with the mother.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong because the frustration is a natural response to an unequal situation. However, the approach taken in the conversation might not be the healthiest for the child's perception. But the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which is a moral judgment. Since the author didn't directly harm the child or the ex, and their intentions were to guide the daughter, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, there's a nuance where the method could be improved. But the user says they think the author isn't in the wrong, and the answer options are A or B. So based on the analysis, the answer is B.\n"
