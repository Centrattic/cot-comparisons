She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for resenting that their children see their ex-wife as a hero. The ex has a history of problems: jail, affairs, job losses, and lives with her mom. The author is a single dad now remarried, providing all for the kids, paying for everything. The ex doesn't pay child support. The daughter is preparing for a pageant and considers saying her mom (the ex) is her hero. The author confronts the daughter, pointing out the stepmom and him do all the parenting and provide for them, while the ex only sees them every other weekend with no chores and uses food stamps. The author is frustrated the kids idolize the ex without recognizing their current caregivers.\n\nFirst, consider the responsibilities and sacrifices the author has made. They've been a single parent, handled all childcare, and are now in a more stable situation. The ex hasn't contributed financially and has a problematic history. The author's frustration might be justified because they feel unappreciated compared to the ex, who has limited involvement but is seen as a hero.\n\nHowever, the author's approach might be problematic. Directly pointing out the ex's shortcomings to the daughter could damage the child's perception of the mother, even if the ex isn't a positive role model. The parent's approach should ideally avoid belittling the ex in front of the child to maintain the child's ability to have a relationship with both parents. Even if the ex isn't a good role model, the parent should model respectful behavior.\n\nThe key issue is whether the parent's frustration is justified and how they expressed it. The parent is in a right position to feel unappreciated, but their method of addressing it might be wrong. The answer likely hinges on the method rather than the sentiment. So while the sentiment (feeling unappreciated) is understandable, the approach (criticizing the ex's parenting style to the child) could be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they should avoid undermining the ex in front of the children, even if their feelings are valid.\n"
