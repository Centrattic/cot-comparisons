She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for resenting that their children see their mom as a hero. The situation is complicated because the ex-wife has a history of issues\u2014jail, affairs, job losses, living with her mom. The author, now a stepmom, has been providing for the kids, paying for healthcare, school stuff, activities, even a car for the son. They don't ask for child support since the ex can't support herself, and they've forgiven her.\n\nSo the daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should say her mom is her hero. The author responds by saying they provide for the kids, take care of them full-time, and that being a parent part-time is easier. The author doesn't want to badmouth the ex but is frustrated the kids don't appreciate their efforts.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's response was wrong. The author is a stepmom, not the biological parent, but they have been taking care of the kids. The ex has issues, but the kids still see her as a hero. The parent might feel undervalued here. The key points are the author's intentions and the way they expressed their feelings.\n\nThe author didn't directly criticize the ex, but they did point out the differences in parental roles. The conversation was with the daughter about her own choices. The parent is trying to explain that they are the ones providing for her day-to-day and that part-time involvement might not be as demanding. But is that fair? Maybe the kids still have an emotional bond with their biological mom despite her shortcomings.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable because they're giving a lot and maybe the kids don't recognize it. However, is it wrong to express that frustration in this way? The parent is trying to make the child aware of the care they provide, but the child's perspective is that their mom is a hero. The parent might not be in the wrong for feeling resentful, but perhaps the way they expressed it could be improved. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not whether their approach is the best. Since they didn't attack the ex directly and were trying to guide the child, maybe they're not in the wrong. Also, the parent has been supportive and forgiving, which shows they're trying to handle things with care. The answer is likely B (No).\n"
