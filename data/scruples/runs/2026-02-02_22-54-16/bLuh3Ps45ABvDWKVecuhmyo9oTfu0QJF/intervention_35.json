She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for resenting that their kids see their mom as a hero, especially when the mom has a troubled history. The author is a single dad who took over raising the kids, remarried, and provides for them, while the mom is described as problematic with multiple issues. The key event is the daughter asking the author if she should say her mom is her hero for a pageant. The author responds by pointing out the realities of their mother's situation and the author's and stepmom's efforts. The author isn't directly belittling the mom but is frustrated that the kids don't appreciate their stepmom and him.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong. I need to assess if their actions are justified.\n\nFirst, the author's frustration is understandable. They've taken on a lot, provided for the kids, and the mom isn't contributing. The author's stepmom is supportive. But when the daughter asks about choosing the mom as a hero, the author's response is to highlight the mom's shortcomings and the family's contributions. The author isn't outright badmouthing the mom but is pointing out the contrast between occasional visits and full-time care.\n\nThe problem could be that the author is influencing the child's perception, even if indirectly. The daughter is still allowed to choose her hero, but the author's comments might make her feel pressured to not choose her mom. However, the author's intention was to explain the situation rather than force the child's choice. The author also mentions they don't want to hurt the mom, so it's not malicious.\n\nIs it wrong to express frustration in this context? The author is a parent figure and has a right to feel they're doing more. But the line is when they start undermining the other parent's role, even if not directly. The response was to educate the child about the realities, which might be necessary for the child to understand the situation. However, it's important that the child is allowed to form her own opinions. The author's approach might be seen as appropriate in explaining their perspective without being negative, as they mention they've forgiven the mom and don't want to hurt her. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because they're addressing their own feelings and explaining their side without directly criticizing the mother. The key is that they left the choice to the child but highlighted the facts. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
