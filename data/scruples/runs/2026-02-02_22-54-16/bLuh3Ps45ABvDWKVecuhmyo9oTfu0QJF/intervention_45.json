She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for resenting that their children see their ex-wife as a hero. The author is a single dad who took care of the kids for three years, then remarried. The ex-wife has a history of issues: jail, affairs, job losses, and lives with her mom. The author provides for the kids, pays for their needs, and even forgoes child support because the ex can't support herself.\n\nThe key incident is when the daughter asks if she should say her mom is her hero for a pageant. The author responds by pointing out the ex's inconsistent parenting and the family's role in supporting the kids. The author doesn't want to badmouth the ex but feels frustrated that the kids don't appreciate what they do.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they're not, but wants confirmation. \n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The author's ex has a troubled history, which affects her parenting. The author has been the primary caregiver, providing everything, and the kids spend most time with them. The ex's visits might be easier as she doesn't have the daily responsibilities. \n\nThe author's response to the daughter is about clarifying the reality, not directly belittling the ex. They're pointing out the contrast between the two parents' roles. The author's resentment comes from feeling unappreciated despite their efforts. The stepmom is also involved, which adds to the support system. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? It's about whether the response was appropriate. The author didn't tell the daughter not to choose her mom, but explained the differences in parenting. There's no direct harm to the daughter's relationship with her mother, but the author's frustration is valid. \n\nThe ex's actions (affairs, jail, etc.) are part of her history, but the author's children might still idolize her for reasons like inconsistency or not understanding the full context. The author's response is an honest reflection of the situation as they see it. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong: The author is expressing their feelings and facts as they know them. They didn't force the daughter to choose, just provided context. The resentment is understandable given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
