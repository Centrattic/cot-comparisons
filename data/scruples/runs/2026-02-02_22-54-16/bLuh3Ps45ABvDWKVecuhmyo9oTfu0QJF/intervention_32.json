She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a man who's a stepfather to his ex-wife's kids. He's had a tough time as a single dad for three years, taking on all the responsibilities, and now he's remarried, and his current wife and he are taking care of the kids. The ex-wife has a history of issues\u2014jail, affairs, unemployment, living with her mom. The current stepfather doesn't ask for child support because the ex can't support herself. But he's frustrated that the kids see their mom as a hero, even though she doesn't contribute much.\n\nThe key incident is when the daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should name her mom as her hero. The stepfather responds by pointing out that they provide for her, and that her mom only sees her two weekends a month with no chores, implying that the mom isn't doing her part. The stepfather doesn't want to badmouth the mom but is frustrated that the kids don't appreciate what he and his wife do.\n\nSo, the user is saying they think the author isn't in the wrong, but they want to know the assistant's take. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boundaries here. As a stepfather, is it appropriate to discuss the mom's shortcomings with the kids? The stepfather didn't directly badmouth her but highlighted the contrast between the two households. He's trying to explain that being a parent is more than just the weekends. However, the kids are still allowed to have their own opinions about their birth mom, especially since she's their biological parent. \n\nHe also mentions that he's forgiven her, which suggests he's trying to be gracious. But the frustration is there because the kids don't seem to recognize their stepmom's efforts. However, the children's perspective is important here. They might not understand the financial and emotional sacrifices their stepmom and stepfather make. The ex-mom gets to be a fun, less demanding parent, which might make her seem like a hero to the kids because she's more lenient, not because she's a better parent in a responsible way.\n\nIs the stepfather wrong for expressing his feelings? Maybe not, but the way he approached it could be problematic. By bringing up the ex's shortcomings in front of the child, even indirectly, he might be influencing the child's perception. The child is trying to decide who to name as a hero, and the stepfather is steering her towards himself and his wife, which could be seen as manipulative.\n\nBut then again, the ex is clearly not a responsible parent, and the stepfather is trying to make the child aware that being present isn't the same as being a good parent. The stepfather is also taking care of the kids' needs, and it's natural to feel unappreciated. However, using the child's question as a platform to compare the two parents might be crossing a line. The child is in a tough spot, having to choose between the two, and the stepfather is not allowing the child to make her own choice without his input.\n\nAlso, the stepfather is the one providing all the resources for the pageant, so maybe the daughter is trying to acknowledge her biological mom despite the stepfather's efforts. The stepfather's response might come off as resentful, which could affect the child's relationship with both parents. Even if the ex is a problematic parent, the child's feelings towards her might be genuine, especially given the time they spend together.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a gray area. The stepfather isn't directly malicious, but he's expressing his frustrations in a way that pressures the child. The act of steering her towards a specific answer, even if it's to highlight his own contributions, might be inconsiderate of the child's need to form her own opinions. Therefore, while his feelings are understandable, his approach could be seen as manipulative, making him possibly at fault. But if the ex's behavior is as bad as described, the stepfather might feel justified. However, the way he handled the situation might be the issue.\n\nSo, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because his intentions are to be honest about the realities of parenting, but A (in the wrong) if the method of expression is inappropriate. However, there's a middle ground. The stepfather isn't in the wrong for feeling resentful, but his response might not be the best approach. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and considering the AITA criteria where intentions matter, but actions do too, it's possible he's not in the wrong because he's trying to make the child aware, but maybe he is in the wrong for manipulating the child's choice. \n\nI think the final answer here is B, not in the wrong, because he's not directly attacking the ex, just making the child aware of the realities. But I'm a bit conflicted. However, given the options, B seems more likely.\n"
