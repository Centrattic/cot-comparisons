She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's children still seeing their ex-wife (who's had a lot of issues) as a hero, and the author is frustrated because they do a lot for the kids now. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The ex-wife has a history of legal problems, affairs, job issues, and lives with her mom. The author was a single dad for three years, then remarried. The stepmom and the author provide for the kids' needs, pay for activities, healthcare, school stuff, even a car for the son and braces for the daughter. They don't ask for child support because the ex can't support herself.\n\nNow, when the daughter is preparing for a pageant, she's asking if she should say her mom is her hero. The author responds by pointing out that the ex only gets the kids two weekends a month with no chores and uses food stamps, implying that being a parent part-time is easier. The author is upset that the kids don't appreciate what they and the stepmom do.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's frustration is valid because they are the primary caregivers now. However, the way they reacted might be problematic. Telling the daughter that her mother's parenting is easier might be undermining the daughter's feelings and the mother's role. The author doesn't want to hurt the ex-wife but is still expressing their frustration.\n\nBut are they in the wrong? Well, the children have the right to have a relationship with both parents, regardless of the ex-wife's flaws. The author's response might be making the daughter feel conflicted or choosing sides, which isn't healthy. Even if the author is doing more for the kids, they shouldn't badmouth the ex-wife in front of the kids. The author's intention is not to derogate the ex, but the effect could still be harmful. The kids might start to feel like they have to pick between parents, which can create guilt or resentment.\n\nAlso, the ex-wife might indeed be a flawed parent, but the children's perception is their own. The author can't control how the kids view their mother, especially during visitation. The author's role should be to foster a positive relationship unless there's abuse or harm, which isn't mentioned here beyond the ex's personal issues.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, but expressing it in a way that compares their parenting to the ex's might be inappropriate. The right approach would be to guide the daughter to express her own feelings without putting her in the middle. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they're interfering with the daughter's relationship with her mother in a negative way, even if it's from a place of frustration.\n"
