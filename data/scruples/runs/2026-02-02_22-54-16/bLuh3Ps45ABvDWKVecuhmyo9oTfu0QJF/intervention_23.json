She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author is a stepfather who's raising his children after their mother, the ex-wife, has a history of issues like jail time, affairs, job loss, and living with her mom. He's a single dad for three years, now remarried, and takes care of all their needs\u2014healthcare, school, activities, even future car and braces. He doesn't ask for child support because the mother can't support herself. He's forgiven her but is frustrated that his kids still see their mother as a hero. \n\nWhen his daughter asks if she should say her mother is her hero for a pageant question, he responds by pointing out that they live with him and his wife full-time, they provide everything, and their mother only sees them two weekends a month without responsibilities. The question is whether he's in the wrong here.\n\nHmm. The key points are his frustration, not wanting to denigrate the mother, and the kids' perception. He's trying to make the kids aware of the reality, maybe to balance their view. But is that right? Did he overstep by bringing up the comparison in the context of the pageant answer? \n\nThe mother's situation is problematic, but the stepfather's approach might be seen as manipulating the kids' opinions. Even though he's providing for them, does he have a right to influence how they perceive their biological mother? He didn't directly badmouth her but highlighted the contrast in care. \n\nSome might argue that he's just being honest and wants the kids to appreciate his family's efforts. Others could see it as undermining the mother, even if indirectly. The line is thin between guiding children to have realistic views and being biased. Since he's the custodial parent, he might think it's valid, but the kids still have access to the other parent. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether his response was a one-time honest conversation or an ongoing effort to sway the kids. Here, it's a single incident where he's reminding his daughter of the actual living situation. He's not forbidding her from saying her mother is a hero but is pointing out the facts. Maybe it's not wrong, as he's not badmouthing her but addressing the imbalance in the kids' perspectives. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because he's trying to give his daughter context about their living arrangements and the reality of their mother's situation without directly criticizing her. He's encouraging appreciation for his family's role while acknowledging the mother's limited involvement. It's a delicate balance, but his intent seems to be to inform rather than to belittle.\n"
