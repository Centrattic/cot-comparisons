She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a stepfather who's resentful that his children still view their mother, who he describes as having a problematic history, as a hero. He's been the primary caregiver for three years, taking on all the responsibilities, and now he's upset because his daughter is considering naming the mother as her hero for a pageant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The ex-wife has a history of issues: jail time, affairs, job losses, living with her mom. The stepfather and his wife take care of the kids, cover all expenses, provide healthcare, activities, education support, etc. He's trying to be forgiving but feels frustrated that the kids don't recognize their efforts and instead idealize their mother.\n\nThe stepfather's response to his daughter about the pageant question is where the conflict arises. He points out that the mother only sees the kids every other weekend, while he and his wife are the primary caregivers. He's not directly criticizing the mother but trying to make the daughter aware of the reality.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? On one hand, he's expressing his feelings of being unappreciated and trying to set the record straight about the mother's limited involvement. On the other hand, he might be undermining the mother's image in the child's eyes, even if subtly. However, since he's not directly badmouthing her but rather comparing the effort and resources each parent provides, maybe it's justified.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user is asking for an answer of A or B. The stepfather's actions seem to stem from a place of frustration over being taken for granted. He's not attacking the mother directly but highlighting the disparity in parenting roles. However, influencing the child's perception of the mother, even if with truth, could be seen as problematic. But given the mother's history, maybe he's not entirely wrong to point out the reality. The key is whether his response was inappropriate. Since he's not being derogatory but factual, and he's trying to manage the child's expectations, perhaps B (not in the wrong) is the answer.\n"
