She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for resenting that his kids see their mother as a hero, given her troubled history and the stepmom's contributions.\n\nFirst, the ex-wife has a lot of issues: jail, affairs, job losses, living with her mom. The author has been a single dad for three years, learned to braid hair, remarried, and now provides everything for the kids. He doesn't ask for child support because she can't support herself.\n\nThe key moment is when the daughter asks about the pageant question. The author responds by pointing out that they live with him, he provides for them, and visiting their mom is easier. He doesn't want to badmouth her but is frustrated they see her as a hero.\n\nNow, considering the situation, the author's resentment might be valid given his sacrifices. However, the way he addressed the daughter's question could be seen as undermining the mother. But he's not directly criticizing her, just highlighting the reality of their living situations. The ex's actions over time have shaped the kids' perceptions. The author's goal is to make the kids appreciate his and his wife's efforts, which is understandable. He's not forcing the daughter to say something, just explaining the context. So, is he in the wrong? Probably not, because his intentions are to foster appreciation and provide a realistic view, even if it's frustrating. The answer is B.\n"
