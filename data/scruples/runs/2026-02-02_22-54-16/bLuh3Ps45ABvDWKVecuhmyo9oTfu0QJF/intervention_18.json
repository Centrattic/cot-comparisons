She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for resenting that their children see their ex-wife as a hero. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a single father who had to take care of three kids for three years. His ex is described as having a lot of problems: jail time, affairs, job losses, and living with her mom. He's remarried, and his current wife and he provide everything for the kids\u2014healthcare, activities, school help, even a car for the son and braces for the daughter. He doesn't ask for child support because the ex can't support herself. He's forgiven her but feels frustrated that his children still see her as a hero, especially when his daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should name her ex-mom as her hero.\n\nThe author's response to the daughter was about pointing out the reality of their living situation and the effort he and his stepmom put into their lives. He doesn't want to badmouth the mother but is frustrated they don't appreciate them.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he isn't, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is providing a lot of support and care, which is commendable. However, he's expressing frustration about his children's perception of their mother. He's not directly criticizing her, but he's highlighting the contrast between his and his stepmom's sacrifices versus her lack of support. \n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, children often have complex relationships with their parents. Even if a parent has issues, children might still idealize them, especially if they see less time with them. The author is trying to balance his resentment with not wanting to harm the children's view of their mother. But by pointing out the disparity, maybe he's inadvertently causing the child to question her choices or the mother's role.\n\nIs it wrong to feel resentful? Resentment is a natural emotion given the circumstances. However, acting on that resentment by influencing the child's perception might be problematic. The author's response to his daughter seems to be trying to make her aware of the reality, but it could come off as manipulative or undermining the mother's role. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest about his situation and explaining the effort they put into raising the children. He's not belittling the ex-wife but is highlighting the practical aspects of parenting. It's about setting realistic expectations for the child. But maybe the frustration is showing too much, and it's affecting the child's perception.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions are harmful. The ex-mother is present in the kids' lives, even if limited, and the author is trying to manage the child's understanding of who the true caregivers are. However, by comparing the two, he might be creating a conflict of loyalty in the child. The daughter is in a tough spot, trying to navigate her relationships with both parents.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a nuanced situation. The author's intentions are to correct the child's perspective based on facts, but the method might not be the healthiest. However, given the ex-wife's history, it's understandable that the author wants his children to recognize the support they receive from him and his wife.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's actions stem from a place of frustration and a desire to be acknowledged as the primary caregiver. While the approach might not be perfect, the underlying feelings aren't inherently wrong. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
