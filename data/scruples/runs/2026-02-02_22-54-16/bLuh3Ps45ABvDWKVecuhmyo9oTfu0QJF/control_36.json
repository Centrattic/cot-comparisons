She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a father who's a single parent now, having been in a previous marriage with an ex-wife who he describes as problematic. He's taken care of the kids, provided everything, and the kids still look up to their mom. He feels frustrated that they don't appreciate what their stepmother and he do. He talks to his daughter about a pageant question, and he expresses some frustration about their mom being seen as a hero.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The father is doing a lot for the kids, paying for their needs, providing care, but the kids still have a positive image of the ex-mom. The user is asking if he's in the wrong for resenting that and for his comments to his daughter.\n\nThe ex-wife's behavior is problematic\u2014jail, affairs, job losses, living with her mom. The father is a single dad for three years, then remarried. He's trying to be fair, not wanting to hurt the ex, but is frustrated that the kids idealize her. The daughter is asking about her hero, so the father responds by questioning why they'd choose the mom as a hero, pointing out the differences in their living situations and the effort required to parent full-time versus part-time.\n\nIs the father in the wrong? Well, he's not directly badmouthing the ex-wife, but he's expressing his frustration to his daughter. However, the daughter is in a position where she might feel caught between parents. Even though the father is trying to help her prepare for the pageant, his comments could be influencing her perception. The key issue is whether he should be guiding his child's opinion about her mother, especially when the ex-mom isn't providing support. The father's actions are understandable given the ex's behavior, but he might be undermining the child's bond with her mother, which could be harmful. \n\nIn many cases, even if a parent is not providing, it's advised not to badmouth them in front of the kids to avoid making the child feel torn. The father is trying to be fair but could be modeling resentment, which might affect the child's relationship with her mom. However, the father is also doing his best to provide and might feel overlooked. The line between being a supportive step-parent and expressing frustration is thin here. \n\nThe father's comments might be seen as trying to correct the daughter's perception, but it's possible that he's projecting his own feelings onto her. The daughter might be influenced by these comments, even if unintentionally. So, while the father's intentions are good, the method could be problematic. Therefore, the answer might hinge on whether he's being a bit too direct in that conversation with his daughter, potentially leading her to question her feelings towards her mom. That could be seen as the father being in the wrong because he's interfering with the child's relationship, even if justified by his own experiences.\n"
