She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a stepfather who's been supporting his stepchildren after their mother's struggles. The stepfather doesn't ask for child support and has done a lot for them. Now, the daughter is preparing for a pageant and wants to name her biological mother as her hero. The stepfather expressed frustration that the kids see their mom as a hero despite her issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the stepfather's perspective. He's taken on the role of a parent, providing for the children financially and emotionally. He's remarried, and his new wife is also involved in their care. He's trying to be fair and even forgiving the ex-wife's past actions. However, he's upset that the children don't recognize his efforts and instead idealize their mother.\n\nThe stepfather's response to the daughter's question about the hero question seems a bit harsh. He points out the practical aspects of their mother's situation\u2014like living with her mom, using food stamps, and the limited time she spends with the kids. He's trying to highlight the differences between his consistent support and her sporadic involvement. But the question is whether this makes him wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, children often form emotional attachments to their biological parents, even if those parents have shortcomings. The children might not be aware of the mother's history or the extent of the stepfather's sacrifices. The stepfather's frustration is understandable, but how he addressed it might be problematic. He didn't directly criticize the mother, but he's influencing the child's perception by emphasizing the care they receive from him and his wife. However, it's important for children to have the freedom to express their feelings without pressure from either parent.\n\nThe stepfather didn't outright stop the child from choosing her mother, but he pointed out the facts. The line between guiding a child and manipulating their feelings can be thin. He might be right in wanting the child to appreciate his efforts, but it's also valid for the child to admire the parent with whom she has a relationship, even if that parent isn't perfect.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key factors are intent and impact. The stepfather's intent is to correct the child's perception, but the impact might be making the child feel conflicted about her choices. However, he didn't force her to choose; he just provided his perspective. The mother's situation is indeed complex, and the stepfather's role as a provider is significant. \n\nConsidering all this, the stepfather is trying to balance his role as a supportive parent while managing his frustration. He didn't cross a direct line of abuse or manipulation, but his actions could be seen as trying to influence the child's perception. However, given the context of his sacrifices and the mother's current situation, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because he's trying to protect his own role and the care he provides, even if his approach is a bit intense. The mother's actions are acknowledged, but the stepfather isn't the one in the wrong here.\n"
