She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person is in the wrong for resenting their kids seeing their mom as a hero. The situation is complicated. The ex-wife has a history of issues: jail, affairs, job losses, living with her mom. The author is a single dad for three years, now remarried, and provides a lot for the kids. He's not asking for child support. The daughter is entering a pageant and asks if she should say her mom is her hero. The author responds by pointing out that they provide everything and the ex only has the kids two weekends a month with no chores, implying it's easier to be a parent part-time.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is frustrated that the kids idolize the mother despite her shortcomings. He's doing a lot for the kids, but they don't seem to appreciate it. His response to the daughter was to highlight the disparity in parental involvement and resources. The question is whether he's in the wrong for this.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the ex-wife is probably not obligated to pay child support since she can't support herself. The author isn't asking her to. The issue here is emotional and psychological. The author is expressing his frustration but in a way that might undermine the mother in front of the child. Even though he says he's forgiven her, his words to the daughter could be seen as discouraging the child from respecting the mother. \n\nThe daughter is in a tough spot, trying to navigate her relationships with both parents. The author's comment might be seen as undermining the mother's role, even if not directly criticizing her. He's pointing out the practical aspects (chores, food stamps) which might make the daughter feel conflicted. \n\nIn terms of co-parenting, it's generally advised to avoid putting children in the middle. The author is doing that by making the daughter question her mother's role as a hero. Even if his intentions are to highlight the effort he and his wife put in, it's placing the child in a position where they have to choose or feel guilty about their feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex-wife's behavior has been problematic. The author has taken on the bulk of the parenting responsibilities. It's understandable that he feels undervalued. But how he expressed that to his daughter could have long-term negative effects on the child's relationship with both parents. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's approach was appropriate. Even if his frustration is valid, the way he addressed it might have been inconsiderate of the daughter's emotional well-being and the potential damage to her relationship with her mother. So, even though the ex is at fault in many ways, the author's response might be in the wrong because he's using the child as a mediator in their parental conflict.\n"
