She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for resenting that his kids see their mom as a hero, given the context. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The ex-wife has a history of issues\u2014jail, affairs, job losses, and currently lives with her mom. The author has been a single dad for three years, learned to braid hair for his daughter, remarried, and provides for the kids' needs. He pays for healthcare, activities, school work, etc. He doesn't ask for child support because she can't support herself. \n\nThe key event is when his daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should say her mom is her hero. The author responds by pointing out their family's support and the challenges of being a full-time parent. He doesn't derogate the mother but expresses frustration. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, but I need to evaluate. \n\nLooking at possible angles: The author is protecting his stepfamily's efforts, which is understandable. He's not badmouthing the ex directly but is highlighting the disparity in parenting roles. However, he might be influencing the kids' perception by pointing out the other parent's shortcomings. \n\nBut the author's actions are framed as trying to balance the kids' appreciation for what he and his wife do. He's not forbidding them from seeing their mom as a hero but is expressing his own frustration. \n\nLegal and ethical considerations: The ex's rights as a parent aren't violated here. The author is managing the kids' living situation, which is his responsibility. However, he's in a position where he's affecting the kids' view of their mother, which could be problematic.\n\nBut the main point is resentment over not being seen as the hero. The author is justified in feeling unappreciated given his contributions, but the way he's responding might subtly undermine the ex. However, he's not directly criticizing her; he's explaining the realities to his daughter.\n\nIn step-parent dynamics, there's a lot of complexity. The author's frustration is about the kids' loyalty and appreciation. He's not in the wrong for feeling that way, but maybe in how he's handling it. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. \n\nConsidering all factors, the answer is B (No). The author's resentment stems from his efforts and the ex's lack of support. He's not wrong for wanting the kids to recognize his contributions, even if it's frustrating they look up to their mother more. The key is he's not attacking her directly, just expressing his feelings.\n"
