She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a stepfather who's been taking care of his ex-wife's kids. The ex has a lot of issues: jail time, affairs, job loss, and living with her mom. The author has been doing a lot for the kids\u2014paying for their needs, providing healthcare, supporting their activities, etc. He doesn't ask for child support because the ex can't support herself. Then, the daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should say her mom is her hero. The author expresses frustration that the kids see their mom as a hero despite her shortcomings and the author's efforts.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeling resentful and speaking to his daughter the way he did. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: He's providing a lot for the kids, which is commendable. Not asking for child support because the ex can't afford it shows he's trying to be understanding. But when the daughter asks about the hero question, he responds by contrasting the ex's part-time parenting with his own full-time role. He points out that the ex doesn't have chores, eats whatever she wants, and uses food stamps. He's trying to make the daughter aware of the reality, but maybe in a way that's undermining the ex's image without outright criticizing her.\n\nThe key here is whether his response is appropriate. The author says he doesn't want to hurt the ex, so he's being careful not to directly criticize her. But he's using the daughter's own experiences to highlight the differences between the two parents' roles. The daughter is in a position where she's supposed to choose a hero, and the author is trying to influence her choice indirectly by pointing out the practical aspects of both parents' lives.\n\nIs it wrong to express frustration here? Well, the author is a parent figure, and it's natural to feel resentful if the kids don't acknowledge the support provided. However, the way he approached the situation might be problematic. By bringing up the ex's living situation and food stamps, he might be implying that the ex isn't a good parent, which could be seen as undermining. Even if he's not directly attacking her, he's using facts to make his point, which could still be hurtful. The daughter is in a position where she has to choose, and the author is steering her towards choosing him as the hero, which might not be fair to the daughter or the ex.\n\nBut the author is also trying to get the daughter to be realistic about her mother's situation. The ex is indeed a problematic parent, so there's a valid concern that the daughter isn't seeing the whole picture. The author's frustration stems from his own sacrifices and the ex's lack of contributions. However, the method of expressing this frustration might not be the healthiest. The daughter might feel caught in the middle, especially if she's trying to maintain a positive image of her mom despite the author's comments.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is not directly criticizing the ex, which is good. He's using factual examples of how the ex's parenting is less demanding. But the daughter might not understand the context of the ex's struggles. The author's approach could lead to the daughter feeling conflicted or pressured to choose a parent, which isn't ideal.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's intentions are to be honest and realistic, but the execution might be flawed. The daughter's question is a personal one, and the author's response might be more about his own feelings of being undervalued rather than the daughter's best interest. However, given the ex's history, it's understandable that the author wants the kids to have a realistic view without outright vilifying the mother.\n\nSo, I think the author isn't in the wrong because his response is a reaction to his legitimate feelings and the ex's situation. However, there's room for improvement in how he handles the situation. He should maybe encourage the daughter to think for herself rather than influencing her choice based on his own frustrations. But strictly speaking, the question is whether he's in the wrong, and given the circumstances, I don't think he is. The answer is B (No).\n"
