She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a stepfather who's frustrated that his children, who live with him and his new wife, still see their biological mother as a hero. The ex-wife has a history of problems like jail, affairs, job issues, and is currently living with her mom. The author mentions they take care of the kids financially and emotionally, paying for everything from healthcare to activities, and even a future car. They don't ask for child support because the mom can't support herself. The conflict arises when the daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should say her mom is her hero. The author responds by pointing out that they're the ones providing all the care and support, and that the mom only sees the kids two weekends a month with no chores.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a stepfather, which can be a tricky role. He's doing a lot for the kids, but the kids still idealize their birth mother despite her issues. The author's frustration is about feeling unappreciated. He's not directly criticizing the mother in front of the kids but is trying to explain the difference in their living situations. However, he might be indirectly undermining the mother's image by contrasting their own care with her minimal efforts. \n\nBut is that wrong? The key here is whether he's violating any boundaries. Since he's not speaking ill of the mother, just highlighting the practical aspects, maybe he's trying to help the daughter understand the reality. However, the daughter is in a position where she's trying to choose a hero, and the author is influencing her choice by pointing out the mother's lack of responsibility versus their own sacrifices. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel justified in wanting the kids to appreciate their current caregivers. He's providing all the support, and it's frustrating that the kids don't see the mother as problematic. But the mother is their biological parent, and even if she's flawed, the kids might not realize that because they see her as a hero during their limited visits. The author's response could be seen as trying to balance the kids' perception, but is that his role? Or is he overstepping by discouraging the daughter from choosing her mother as a hero?\n\nAlso, the fact that he's not asking for child support because she can't support herself shows he's trying to be lenient. However, the kids living with their stepdad and stepmom, who are providing everything, might naturally lead the kids to be grateful to them. The mother's inconsistent presence might make it hard for the kids to see her as anything but a hero during their time with her, even if it's not the full picture.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for expressing his frustration. He's not belittling the mother, just explaining the situation. But maybe the daughter is in a position where she's torn between two parents, and the author's response could be seen as pushing her towards a certain answer. The parent's role here is to guide, but perhaps he's overcorrecting. It's a sensitive topic, and the answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about co-parenting after divorce.\n\nIn some cases, it's important to let children form their own opinions about their parents. The author might be trying to be honest, but if the daughter chooses her mother as a hero, maybe that's her right. The author's frustration is valid, but how he expressed it could be problematic. He's pointing out the mother's shortcomings in a way that might make the daughter question her choice, even if he's not directly criticizing her.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because he's trying to help the daughter understand the reality of the situation without directly insulting the mother. Alternatively, it could be that he is in the wrong because he's manipulating the daughter's perception. It's a tough call, but I think the key is that he's not attacking the mother but highlighting the care they provide. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
