She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person is a stepfather who's been taking care of his children full-time for three years after a divorce. His ex-wife has a history of problems: jail time, affairs, job losses, and currently lives with her mom. He and his new wife provide everything for the kids\u2014healthcare, school help, activities, future car and braces. He doesn't ask for child support because she can't support herself. Now, his daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should say her mom (the ex) is her hero. The stepfather responds by pointing out that they provide for her, she lives with them full-time, and that being a parent part-time is easier than full-time. He's frustrated that the kids see the ex as an angel and don't appreciate the stepfamily's efforts.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but they want my opinion. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, let's consider the stepfather's perspective. He's taken on a lot of responsibility, and the kids are with him full-time. His ex is a difficult figure, but he's chosen forgiveness and not to hurt her image. However, he's frustrated because the kids seem to value the ex more, even though she's not providing the same level of care. His response to the daughter was meant to clarify that the ex isn't the main parent, but he's not attacking her directly. He's pointing out the reality of the situation without being derogatory.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter might be influenced by her time with the ex, even if it's only two weekends a month. Kids can perceive things differently, especially if the ex is more lenient or spends quality time with them. The stepfather's comment might come across as trying to undermine the daughter's choice or make her question her feelings. But he's not forcing her to say anything; he's just explaining his viewpoint. He's also acknowledging the ex's role without belittling her, just highlighting the stepfamily's contributions.\n\nIs there an issue with his approach? Well, he's not being disrespectful, just honest about the situation. He's helping the daughter understand the dynamics, which might be necessary for her to form a realistic view. It's possible that the kids, especially a young daughter, might idealize a parent who's more available during weekends, even if that parent isn't the primary caregiver. The stepfather's frustration is valid because he's the one handling the daily responsibilities.\n\nBut is he wrong to express that frustration in this context? Maybe not. He's not forcing her to choose, just explaining his perspective. It's important for the children to know the truth about their parents' situations without badmouthing. The key here is that he's not attacking the ex, just pointing out the practicalities. His response is about the children's well-being and their understanding of the actual support they receive. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong. His intentions are good, and his response is a way to help the daughter understand the realities without being negative towards the ex. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
