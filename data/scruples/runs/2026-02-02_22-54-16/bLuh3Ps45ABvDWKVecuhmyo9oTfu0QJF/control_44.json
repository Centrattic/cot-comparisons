She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person is a step-parent who's taking care of their children, paying for everything, and they feel resentful because the kids see their biological mother as a hero, even though the mother has a history of problems.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The ex-wife has a history of jail time, affairs, job losses, and lives with her mom. The current step-parent and their spouse are providing for the kids\u2014healthcare, activities, school projects, a car for the son, braces for the daughter. The ex doesn't pay child support because she can't support herself. The step-parent has forgiven her but is frustrated that the kids still idealize her.\n\nThe daughter is asking for advice on her pageant question about heroes. The step-parent responds by pointing out that they provide for her and that the mother only has the kids two weekends a month with no chores, implying that being a parent part-time is easier. The step-parent doesn't want to badmouth the ex but is frustrated that the kids don't appreciate them more.\n\nNow, the question is whether the step-parent is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about how the step-parent handled the situation. They didn't directly insult the ex, but they did make a comparison to their daughter about the mother's role versus theirs. The step-parent is trying to be fair and not hurt the ex's feelings but is also expressing their own frustration. The daughter is in a position where she has to choose how to answer, and the step-parent is influencing that choice indirectly.\n\nIs it wrong to express frustration about being taken for granted? On one hand, the step-parent is providing a lot and feels unappreciated. On the other hand, they are the ones supporting the children, and the ex isn't contributing. However, the step-parent's approach might be subtle but could be seen as undermining the ex's image in front of the daughter. They didn't outright say the mother is bad, but they did highlight the mother's lack of effort compared to their own.\n\nIn many cultures, it's generally advised not to speak ill of an ex in front of the kids, even if the ex is making poor choices. The goal is to maintain a balanced view and not poison the kids against the other parent. The step-parent is trying to get the daughter to consider the reality of their contributions versus the mother's, which could be seen as influencing the daughter's perception.\n\nSo, while the step-parent's feelings are valid, their method of expressing those feelings might be inappropriate. They are using the daughter's pageant question as a way to highlight their own role, which could be seen as manipulating the situation. Therefore, the step-parent might be in the wrong because they are not respecting the daughter's autonomy in choosing a hero and are projecting their own frustrations onto the child.\n\nBut wait, the step-parent also mentions they don't want to hurt the ex and haven't derogated her. They are just pointing out facts about their contributions. However, the key issue is whether they are using the daughter's question to do so. Even if the facts are true, framing it in a way that suggests the ex isn't a good parent could be harmful. The daughter is in a vulnerable position, and the step-parent is in a position of authority. Maybe the right approach is to let the daughter form her own opinions rather than influencing her to see the mother as less of a hero.\n\nSo, considering all that, the step-parent's actions might be in the wrong because they are using the situation to express their own frustrations indirectly, which could be unfair to both the daughter and the ex-wife. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
