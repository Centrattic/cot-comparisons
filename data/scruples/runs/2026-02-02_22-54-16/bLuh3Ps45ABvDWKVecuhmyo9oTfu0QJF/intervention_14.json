She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person is a stepfather who's been taking care of his children full-time, providing everything, while the kids' biological mother has a troubled history. The kids still see their mom as a hero. The author is upset about that and had a conversation with his daughter about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author mentions his ex-wife's issues: jail time, affairs, job losses, living with her mom. He's been a single dad for three years, which sounds really tough. Now he's remarried and his stepfamily provides everything for the kids. He's not asking for support from the mother because she can't support herself. He's forgiven her, but he's frustrated that the kids idealize her.\n\nThe key moment is when the daughter asks about choosing her mom as a hero for a pageant. The author responds by pointing out the ex's shortcomings, explaining that being a parent part-time is easier than doing it full-time. The author isn't directly putting down the mother but is highlighting the differences in their situations.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's trying to make his daughter aware of the reality. He's not attacking her mother but explaining his perspective. However, there's a risk in making a child choose between parents. The daughter is in a tough spot, having to navigate both parents' expectations. The author might be trying to correct her skewed perception, but he's not being negative about the mother. He's more focused on the effort and resources he and his wife have provided.\n\nOn one hand, the author is justified in feeling underappreciated, given the sacrifices made. On the other hand, he is in a position where he's not the biological parent, so there might be different expectations. However, he's been the primary caregiver. The daughter's loyalty to her biological mother is natural, but the author's frustration is valid if the mother isn't contributing. The author's response doesn't seem malicious; he's trying to balance the daughter's views. Since he's not badmouthing the mother and is explaining his side gently, he might not be in the wrong. The answer could be B.\n"
