She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is a stepdad who's taking care of his stepchildren. He mentions that the kids' biological mom has a history of jail time, affairs, job losses, and lives with her mom. He's been a single dad for three years, doing all the parenting stuff like braiding hair, and now he's married again. His new wife and him provide everything for the kids: healthcare, school help, activities, projects, even a car for the son and braces for the daughter. He doesn't ask for child support from the ex because she can't support herself. He's forgiven her.\n\nNow, the daughter is entering a pageant and was asked about her hero. The daughter asked if she should say her mom. The author responded by pointing out that they provide for her, they registered her for the pageant, they take care of her full-time, and that while she goes to her mom every other weekend, there she has no chores and eats what she wants (mom uses food stamps). He says it's easier to be a parent part-time, whereas being a parent all the time is harder. He's frustrated the kids see the mom as a hero instead of appreciating all he and his wife do. He says he hasn't badmouthed the mom and doesn't want to hurt her, but he's frustrated.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is a stepdad, not the biological parent. He's providing for the kids, which is commendable. The ex is problematic, but he's not holding it against the kids. He's trying to explain to his daughter that while her biological mom does her part (even if it's minimal), the stepdad and his wife are the ones who are fully supporting the kids. However, he's expressing frustration that the kids still see the biological mom as a hero.\n\nIs it wrong to feel resentful in this situation? Well, resentment is a natural emotion, especially after providing so much while the other parent isn't contributing. But the key is how he expressed it. He didn't directly criticize the mother in front of the daughter but instead explained the logistics of their living situations. He might be trying to help the daughter understand the reality without badmouthing the mom. However, he's still trying to influence the daughter's perception, which could be seen as undermining the mother, even if indirectly.\n\nBut considering the mother's history, is it fair for the kids to idolize her? The author is concerned about the daughter not appreciating the support from the stepdad and stepmom. The ex isn't contributing financially, and the author is covering all expenses. The stepdad is trying to balance between being fair to the kids' feelings about their mom and making them aware of the actual support they receive.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often considers intent and actions. The author didn't lash out or say mean things about the mother. He's just pointing out the practical realities. However, he might be trying to shift the daughter's view, which could be seen as meddling. But given the mother's history, maybe it's justified. The stepdad's frustration is understandable, but should the kids' perception of their mother be his responsibility?\n\nAlternatively, the daughter is just answering the question based on her experiences. If the mother is present even if part-time, the daughter might naturally look up to her. The stepdad and his wife are providing the majority of care, but the mother's role, though flawed, is still a part of the child's life.\n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped by trying to influence the daughter's answer. He didn't force her but gave his perspective. It's a delicate balance between being honest and not undermining the mother. Since the author hasn't derogated the mother directly, just highlighted the support system, maybe it's not wrong. But some might argue that it's the children's right to have their own views of their parents, even if the parent is problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is trying to manage his feelings and the children's perceptions without being overtly negative. His actions are more about explaining the situation rather than attacking the mother. So, he's probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
