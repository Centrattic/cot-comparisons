She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for resenting that his kids see their mom as a hero, even though she's had a lot of issues. The author is a stepfather who's been taking care of the kids, providing everything, and the kids are with their mom every other weekend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The ex-wife has a history of problems\u2014jail, affairs, job losses, living with her mom. The stepdad has been the primary caregiver for three years, doing a lot, including learning to braid hair. Now, the kids are in their care full-time, and the stepdad is paying for everything. The daughter is asking about her hero for a pageant, and when she mentions the mother, the stepdad responds by pointing out the mother's lack of responsibility and the stepdad's own efforts.\n\nThe question is whether the stepdad is in the wrong for expressing frustration. He didn't directly criticize the mother but explained the reality to his daughter. The user thinks he's not wrong, but wants to know the opinion.\n\nI should consider if the stepdad's response was appropriate. He didn't attack the mother directly but highlighted the mother's shortcomings in a way that might influence the child's perception. However, since the kid is asking for advice, the stepdad is trying to guide her. But is that okay?\n\nOn one hand, the stepdad is frustrated because he's the one providing all the support. On the other hand, the children might still have a positive view of their biological mother despite her issues. The stepdad's response might be seen as undermining the mother's image, even if he's trying to correct the child's skewed perception.\n\nBut the key point is that he's not criticizing the mother directly, just explaining the situation. He's not making the child choose between them, but pointing out the reality. He's also given the child the choice to answer however she wants. The frustration is about the child's possible bias towards the mother despite her shortcomings.\n\nI think the stepdad is justified in feeling frustrated. He's doing a lot for the kids, and it's natural to feel underappreciated. His response was a way to make his daughter aware of the mother's lack of contribution and his own efforts. However, it's a delicate situation because he's not their biological parent. But he's the one providing for them daily, so his perspective is valid. He didn't force the child to say one thing or another, just gave her information. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
