She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for resenting their children viewing their mother as a hero, especially given the ex's history. The author has taken on a lot as a single dad, providing for the kids, and now after remarrying, they and their new wife are handling everything. The ex isn't contributing, and the kids still seem to have a positive image of her, which is causing frustration.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The ex has a problematic history\u2014jail, affairs, job instability, living with her mom. The author has been the primary caregiver, even before remarrying. They're not asking for child support, which shows some forgiveness. However, when the daughter questions if she should say her mom is her hero, the author responds by pointing out the ex's lack of responsibility and the current caregivers' efforts. The key issue here is whether the author's frustration is justified and if their response crossed a line.\n\nThe author didn't directly attack the ex but highlighted the contrast between the ex's limited role and their own contributions. They mention that the ex's parenting is easier because it's only two weekends a month. This might be seen as trying to influence the child's perception, which could be problematic. However, considering the ex's history, the author is trying to explain the reality to the child. The question is whether this response was appropriate.\n\nChildren often have a positive view of their biological parents regardless of the parent's behavior, which the author is aware of. The author's frustration stems from feeling unappreciated and wanting the children to recognize their efforts. However, the way they expressed this might have been a bit harsh, especially when the child is preparing for a pageant and asking for advice. The author's response could potentially undermine the child's relationship with her biological mother, even if the ex isn't a good parent. There's a balance between protecting the child's well-being and not alienating them from a parent, even a flawed one.\n\nIn family law and child psychology, it's generally advised to avoid badmouthing the other parent, as it can harm the child's emotional development. However, the author hasn't outright insulted the ex but rather pointed out the practical realities. The main issue is the resentment and the desire to shift the child's perception, which might not be in the child's best interest. The author's actions are understandable given the circumstances, but the approach might be questionable. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit nuanced. They're justified in feeling frustrated but may have overstepped by trying to influence the child's view. However, since they didn't directly belittle the ex and were explaining the situation, it's not entirely their fault. The answer might be B, not in the wrong, but with a caveat about the approach.\n"
