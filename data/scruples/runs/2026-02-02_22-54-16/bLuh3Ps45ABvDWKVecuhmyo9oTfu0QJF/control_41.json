She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, a stepfather, feeling resentful that his children view their biological mother, the ex-wife, as a hero despite her problematic behavior. The ex-wife has a history of legal issues, affairs, job instability, and currently lives with her mother. The author, now remarried, has been taking care of the children, providing for all their needs, and not asking for child support because the mother can't support herself.\n\nThe key point here is the author's response when the daughter asks if she should say her mom is her hero for the pageant. The author points out the disparity in parenting: the children live with him and his wife full-time, who take care of everything, while with their mom, they have less responsibility (no chores) and she uses food stamps. He's frustrated that the kids see their mom as an angel without recognizing what he and his wife do.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The question is about whether his reaction is justified. On one hand, he's expressing frustration about the children's perception of their mother, given her history and the stepfamily's support. On the other hand, he's not outright badmouthing her but is pointing out the reality to the daughter. However, the daughter is still young (8 years old) and might not fully grasp the context of her mother's situation. The stepfather's response could potentially influence the child's perception, even if he's not directly criticizing the mother. \n\nBut considering that the author is trying to explain the situation honestly, he's not lying. The mother's behavior has been problematic, and the stepfather is highlighting the differences in parenting to help the child understand. While it's important for children to maintain a relationship with both parents, the mother's actions have led to the current situation. The author's frustration is understandable, but is it wrong to express that? Maybe not entirely, especially since he's not forcing the child to choose but is explaining the facts. However, the way he frames it might be a bit dismissive of the mother's role, even if she's not a good parent. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that he's forgiven her, so his resentment might not be about her faults but about the children's perception. The line is thin between guiding the child's understanding and undermining the mother. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about child-rearing and co-parenting. In many cases, it's advised not to speak negatively about the other parent in front of the children, to maintain a positive relationship even if the parent isn't ideal. But the author isn't badmouthing; he's explaining the practical aspects. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong (B). He's being honest about the situation and the support he and his wife provide, which is valid. The key is that he's not attacking the mother directly but pointing out the realities to the child in a way that might help her understand the dynamics without directly criticizing her mother. The frustration is justified given the circumstances, and he's not withholding support or love. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
