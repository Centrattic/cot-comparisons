She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a father who is a step-parent now, and his kids see their mom (his ex) as a hero, even though she has a troubled history. The father is frustrated because he and his new wife take care of the kids, providing everything, while the ex has issues like jail time, affairs, and can't support herself. When his daughter asks about choosing her mom as her hero for a pageant, the father responds by pointing out that he and his wife take care of them full-time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects here. The father feels he's doing more, but the kids still look up to their mom. The ex mom isn't involved much but gets idealized. The step-parent is trying to explain that being a parent all the time is harder than part-time visits. But is he wrong to express that?\n\nFrom a parental responsibility standpoint, the father is trying to manage the kids' perception without being negative. He doesn't want to hurt the ex, but he's frustrated. The daughter is 8, so she's young. The father's response could influence her view of both parents. However, he's not directly criticizing the ex mother; he's just highlighting the step-parent's role. \n\nBut does he have a right to be upset? It's natural for kids to sometimes idealize a parent they see less of. The step-parent is doing a lot, but the biological parent might still be seen as special. The father's frustration is valid, but how he addresses it matters. His response is honest but might be harsh for a young child to understand. Is he in the wrong for expressing his feelings, or is it okay to set realistic expectations?\n\nAlso, he's not cutting off contact, but he's trying to balance the kids' perception. The key question is whether his response is reasonable or if he overstepped. The answer depends on whether his words were meant to undermine the mother or just to help the daughter understand the situation. He says he doesn't want to derogate her, so maybe he's in a tough spot here. \n\nIn summary, the father's intentions are good, but his method might be questionable. However, the core issue is about differing parental roles and the child's perception. The answer likely depends on cultural or social norms around co-parenting and step-parent dynamics. I think the answer is B (No) because he's trying to manage the situation without being negative, but he's frustrated and wants the kids to appreciate his efforts. However, it's a close call. He might be in the right not to be in the wrong (B), but some might argue he's overreacting. Need to check if his response was appropriate.\n"
