She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the person is asking if they're at fault for resenting their kids seeing their mom as a hero. The mom has a lot of issues: jail time, affairs, lost jobs, lives with her mom. The ex is a single dad for three years, did a lot for the kids, even learned to braid hair. Now remarried, their stepmom helps with everything, pays for stuff, and they don't ask for child support because the ex mom can't support herself.\n\nThen the daughter is preparing for a pageant, and asked about her hero. The daughter considered saying her mom. The ex dad responded by pointing out that they provide for her, and that it's easier to be a parent part-time. He didn't directly criticize the mom but implied that the mom isn't doing much. He doesn't want to hurt the mom's image, but is frustrated the kids don't appreciate what he and his stepmom do.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break this down. The key points are the ex's actions versus the stepmom's. The ex took care of the kids full-time, now the stepmom is handling most of the responsibilities. He's not asking for child support because the ex mom can't afford it. But when the daughter asks about her hero, the ex dad's response is trying to highlight the contrast between the time he puts in versus the ex's sporadic involvement.\n\nIs it wrong to express frustration that the kids see the mom as a hero? Well, the ex dad is trying to manage the kids' perception without being negative about the mom. He's pointing out the reality of the situation\u2014like the mom's part-time care versus their full-time support. However, he's not directly criticizing the mom but the daughter's answer. But he's also the one providing for the kids, so maybe he's justified in feeling underappreciated. However, encouraging the daughter to not choose her mom as a hero could be seen as undermining the mom, even if indirectly. The stepmom isn't the biological parent, so the daughter's relationship with her is different. The ex dad is trying to balance between not hurting the ex's feelings and wanting the kids to recognize their sacrifices. \n\nBut is he wrong? It's a complex situation. The stepmom is providing for them, but the biological mom is still part of their lives. The ex dad's frustration might be valid, but the way he's addressing it could be problematic. By pointing out the ex's shortcomings through the daughter's choice, he's influencing her perception. Maybe he should focus on his own role as a supportive parent rather than trying to redirect the daughter's admiration. However, given the context of the ex mom's behavior, it's understandable that he feels this way. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether his actions are inconsiderate or if they're a reasonable expression of his feelings. Since he's not directly belittling the mom but highlighting the practicalities, he might not be in the wrong. But the question is about resentment and the kids' perception. If the stepmom is the one providing, but the kids still idolize the ex mom despite her issues, it's a conflict of interests. The dad is trying to assert his and his wife's role, which is a tricky situation. Maybe he's not wrong because he's trying to ensure the kids recognize the support they receive, but he's handling it in a way that could be seen as manipulative. However, given the circumstances, it's a tough spot. The answer might be B (No), because he's not in the wrong, but it's a close call.\n"
