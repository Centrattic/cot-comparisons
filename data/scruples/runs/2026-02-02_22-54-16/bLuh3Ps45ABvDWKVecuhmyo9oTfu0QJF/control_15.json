She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a father who's a single dad for three years, now remarried. The kids see their mom as a hero, despite her having a troubled history. The stepmom and dad are providing for the kids, but the kids still look up to the mom.\n\nThe father is frustrated because he's the one providing all the support, and the kids seem to appreciate the mom more. In a specific instance, the daughter is doing a pageant and asks if she should say her mom is her hero. The dad responds by pointing out that the stepmom and he take care of them, and that their mom only sees them every other weekend with fewer responsibilities.\n\nSo, the question is whether the dad is wrong for feeling resentful and expressing this to his daughter. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The ex-wife has a history of issues: jail, affairs, job losses, living with her mom. The current parents are providing everything, paying for school, activities, healthcare, etc. The dad is a single parent for three years, which is a huge commitment. \n\nHowever, when the daughter asks if she should say her mom is her hero, the dad's response is a bit harsh. He mentions that the kids live with him and the stepmom, and that their mom only has them two weekends a month with no chores and food stamps. The dad is trying to point out the contrast in the level of care, but maybe in a way that undermines the mother's role. \n\nThe key points here are about the dad's resentment and how he addressed it. He didn't attack the ex-wife directly but tried to highlight the stepmom and his own contributions. However, he's frustrated that the kids see their mom as an angel. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, as a parent, it's important to avoid undermining the other parent in front of the children. Even if the ex-wife isn't the ideal parent, the dad should probably refrain from criticizing her in a way that makes the kids feel they should question their mother's hero status. However, the dad is also providing a lot, and his feelings of resentment might be valid. \n\nBut in terms of parenting, it's generally advised not to badmouth the other parent to the children. Even if the ex has issues, the dad's response could be seen as trying to influence the daughter's perception. The dad's intention might be to correct the child's view, but the method could be problematic. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's expressing resentment to his daughter about the other parent, which isn't advisable. Even though his situation is challenging, he should work on managing his feelings instead of voicing them in a way that could affect the kids' opinions. However, there's nuance here. The dad is providing a lot, and his feelings are understandable, but the way he's handling it might not be the best approach. \n\nAlternatively, some might argue that the dad is justified in feeling frustrated and isn't necessarily wrong for expressing his perspective. But from a parenting advice standpoint, undermining the other parent's image, even indirectly, is usually discouraged. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
