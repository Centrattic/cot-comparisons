She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the user is a stepfather who's been taking care of his children financially and emotionally since their mother was a single parent and then left them. Now, the kids live with their stepfather and his new wife, who provide everything for them. The user is frustrated because the kids still see their mother as a hero despite her issues. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. He's had to step up as a single parent for three years, even learning to braid hair to take care of his daughter. He's now married again, and they're fully supporting the kids, including big expenses like a car and braces. He doesn't ask for child support because he knows the mother can't support herself. He's forgiven her, but he's frustrated when his daughter considers her mother a hero.\n\nNow, the daughter is asking about her hero for a pageant. The user responds by pointing out that their stepfamily takes care of them, and that their mom only has them two days a week. He's not badmouthing her, but he's highlighting the contrast between the two. The user is concerned that the kids don't appreciate what their stepfamily does for them.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, he's not directly putting down the mother, but he's trying to influence the child's perception. The child is in a position where she has to choose who she considers her hero. The mother's flaws are significant, but the child still sees her that way, maybe because the time with the mother is less stressful, or she's trying to be a good mom when she has the kids, even if she can't handle being a full-time parent. \n\nThe user's frustration is understandable, but as a parent, even a step-parent, he might be overstepping by trying to sway the child's opinion. The child's feelings towards her mother are her own, and the stepfather should respect that. Even if he's the primary caregiver now, the child has the right to have her own feelings, even if they're influenced by the limited time with her biological mother.\n\nAlso, the user is in a position of authority, so his comment might come off as coercive. He's pointing out the stepfamily's contributions and the mother's lack of support, which could make the child feel bad for having those feelings. It's possible that the child doesn't fully understand the complexities of her mother's situation. The stepfather might be trying to correct a perceived imbalance, but the way he's doing it could be wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, he's trying to get the child to appreciate the support they provide. However, the child's admiration for her mother might be genuine, based on her experiences. The stepfather's role is to support the child, not to force her to admire him or his wife. The key here is whether he's being respectful of the child's autonomy in forming her own opinions. \n\nIn conclusion, while the user's feelings are valid, he might be in the wrong because he's trying to shape the child's perception instead of allowing her to form her own views. It's important for the child to understand both sides but without being pressured. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting the child's independent feelings and is possibly manipulating her to see the stepfamily as better, which isn't fair.\n"
