She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's children idolizing their mother despite her issues, and the author's frustration about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The ex-wife has a history of problems\u2014jail, affairs, job losses, living with her mom. The author was a single dad for three years, now remarried, providing for the kids. He's not asking for child support because she can't support herself. He forgives her but is upset that the kids see their mom as a hero, especially after his stepmom and he take care of them.\n\nThe key moment is when the daughter asks if she should say her mom is her hero. The author responds by pointing out that they provide for the kids, and that their mom only sees them two weekends a month with no chores and food stamps. The author doesn't want to badmouth the mom but is frustrated the kids don't appreciate what they do.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to be fair and not derogatory towards the ex-wife. He's pointing out the reality of the situation: the ex can't support herself, the kids have more with him and his wife. He's explaining that it's harder to be a parent all the time. He's not directly criticizing the ex-wife but highlighting the practicalities.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the emotional aspect. Kids might naturally idealize their biological parents, especially if they have limited time with them. The author is a step-parent, and the kids might be torn between two households. The ex might not have the resources to provide, but she's present when she can. The author's frustration is understandable, but is it wrong to express that reality?\n\nLegally and ethically, parents are supposed to encourage a relationship with the other parent unless there's abuse. Since the ex isn't abusive, just has issues, the author shouldn't interfere with the kids' relationship. However, the author is not preventing contact, just expressing his feelings of being unappreciated.\n\nThe author's response to the daughter might be seen as trying to influence her answer, which could be problematic. But he's not directly telling her not to choose her mom; he's pointing out the practicalities. He's not being derogatory, just stating facts. The line here is thin\u2014parents should support their children's relationships with the other parent unless it's harmful. Since the ex isn't abusive, even with her flaws, the author's frustration is about appreciation, not about the ex's actions towards the kids.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He's not directly criticizing the ex, but he's highlighting the disparity in care. He's also the one providing all the resources. The kids seeing their mom as a hero could be due to her being a more present figure in their lives during the time they have, even if she can't support them financially. The author's efforts are valid, but the kids' attachment isn't necessarily his fault.\n\nThe answer might depend on cultural norms or specific family dynamics. However, since the author isn't blocking contact or badmouthing the ex, just expressing his feelings of being unappreciated, he's likely not in the wrong. The key is that he's not acting out of malice but from a place of frustration. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
