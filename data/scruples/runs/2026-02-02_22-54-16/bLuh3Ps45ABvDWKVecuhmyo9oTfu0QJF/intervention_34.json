She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who's been a single dad for three years, caring for his kids, and now he's remarried. He's providing everything for his children, but his kids see their mother, who has a history of problems, as a hero. The father feels resentful and had a conversation with his daughter about it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. The father has put in a lot of effort, time, and resources into his children's lives. He's taken on the role of a parent, even learning to braid hair, which shows dedication. He also doesn't ask for child support from the mother, who can't support herself. That's a significant point. He's chosen to forgive her, which is a mature stance.\n\nThe daughter is entering a pageant and asks if she should say her mom is her hero. The father responds by pointing out that they provide for her, take care of her more, and that the mother only sees the kids two weekends a month. He's trying to highlight the reality of the situation without being derogatory towards the mother. He doesn't want to harm the kids' image of their mom but is frustrated they don't appreciate what he and his wife do.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, but wants another opinion. Let me consider the possible angles. The father is expressing frustration without directly badmouthing the mother, which is a good point. He's trying to balance his feelings with not wanting to damage the children's relationship with their mother. However, is it wrong to feel resentful in this case?\n\nResentment is a natural emotion when someone feels unappreciated, especially after putting in so much effort. The father isn't badmouthing the mother, so he's not forcing the children to take sides. He's just explaining the other side to the daughter. The mother's issues are well-documented, so the father's perspective is understandable. \n\nBut there's a line between expressing frustration and being in the wrong. The father is trying to help the daughter understand the context, not put down the mother. The key here is that he's not making the daughter choose between parents but is gently pointing out the differences in their level of involvement. \n\nI think the father is justified in his feelings. He's not in the wrong for feeling resentful, as long as he's not acting out in harmful ways. He's communicating his perspective to his daughter to help her make an informed choice without disrespecting the mother. So the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
