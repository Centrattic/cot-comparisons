She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for resenting that their children see their ex-wife as a hero. The ex-wife has a history of issues like jail, affairs, job losses, and living with her mom. The author, now a step-parent, is providing all the kids' needs, including healthcare, activities, and even future car and braces. They don't ask for child support because the ex can't support herself.\n\nThe conflict arises when the daughter considers naming the biological mom as her hero in a pageant. The author responds by pointing out the ex's shortcomings and the effort they put into parenting. The author doesn't want to hurt the ex but is frustrated that the kids don't appreciate what the step-parent and them do.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a step-parent who has taken on the role of a full-time parent, providing extensively. The ex is present only part-time but is seen as a hero. The author's frustration is about the kids not recognizing the step-parent's efforts. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't directly insult the ex-wife, but they did highlight her shortcomings to the daughter. The author's intention was to make the daughter aware of the realities, not to badmouth the ex. However, the way they addressed the daughter might have been a bit harsh. But given the context, the author is trying to balance between not wanting to damage the daughter's perception of her mother and feeling undervalued. \n\nIn many cases, step-parents invest a lot, and it's natural to feel overlooked. The author's response was a moment of frustration but aimed at explaining the situation rather than belittling the ex. The key is whether the author crossed a line. They didn't forbid the daughter from choosing her mom, just explained the situation. So, likely, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're in a complex situation, trying to manage their feelings while taking care of the kids. The resentment is understandable given their sacrifices.\n"
