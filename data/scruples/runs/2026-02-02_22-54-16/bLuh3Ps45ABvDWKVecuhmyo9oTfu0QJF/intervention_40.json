She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a single dad who's been taking care of his kids for three years while their mom has a troubled history. Now he's remarried, and they support the kids financially and emotionally. The daughter is preparing for a pageant and wants to mention her mom as her hero. The dad is frustrated because he feels they don't appreciate what he and his wife do for them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dad's perspective. He's worked hard, provided everything, and the kids still look up to their mom despite her issues. He's not saying bad things about her but pointing out the contrast between the two parenting situations. He's trying to help his daughter think critically about the question.\n\nOn the other hand, the kids are children. They might not fully understand the complexities of their parents' situations. The dad is their primary caregiver, but they see their mom as a hero, maybe because she's more lenient or because they don't know the full story. The dad's frustration is valid because he's doing a lot, but should he be the one to correct their perception, especially in a sensitive way?\n\nThe key here is his approach. He didn't attack their mom directly but explained the differences in parenting. He's not forcing them to change their views but is trying to make them aware of the reality. It's possible that the kids aren't aware of their mom's shortcomings because she might present herself differently. The dad is trying to balance being supportive while also being honest about the situation.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he's not telling them to hate their mom. He's just highlighting the practical aspects of being a parent. His actions are out of frustration but also a desire for the kids to appreciate what he and his wife do. However, he might be overstepping by trying to influence their answer to the pageant question. But given the context, his intentions are good. He's not being malicious, just expressing his feelings and the reality of the situation.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's trying to guide his daughter and help her see the broader picture without being negative. His frustration is justified given the circumstances.\n"
