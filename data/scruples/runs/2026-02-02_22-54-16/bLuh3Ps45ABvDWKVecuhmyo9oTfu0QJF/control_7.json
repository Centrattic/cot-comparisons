She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent (the author) who is upset that their children see their mother, the author's ex-wife, as a hero. The ex-wife has a history of issues: jail time, affairs, job losses, and currently lives with her mom. The author has been a single dad for three years, caring for three kids and has since remarried. They take care of the kids' needs, including healthcare, activities, school work, and even paying for a future car and braces. They don't ask for child support because the ex can't support herself.\n\nThe author is frustrated because their daughter is about to enter a pageant and asked if she should say her mom is her hero. The author's response was to point out that the stepmom and they provide everything, and that their mom has it easier with less responsibility. The author doesn't want to badmouth the ex but is upset the kids don't appreciate what they do.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the key points. The author is a step-parent who's providing a lot, and the ex is not fulfilling her responsibilities. The author's response to the daughter was to highlight the contrast in parenting roles. However, the author didn't directly criticize the ex in front of the kids but tried to explain the situation. The main issue is whether the author's frustration is justified and if their approach is appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, the author has every right to feel frustrated. They are the ones providing for the kids daily, and the ex's inconsistent parenting might lead the kids to have an unrealistic view of her. The author is trying to help the daughter understand the context without being negative.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's response might be seen as indirectly belittling the ex, even if not directly. The children are still entitled to a relationship with their mother, even if she's not a perfect parent. The author's role is to ensure the kids can maintain that relationship without undermining the other parent.\n\nIn custody situations, it's generally advised not to speak negatively about the other parent. The author's statement could potentially harm the child's relationship with the ex. Even though the author is a step-parent now, the kids still have a legal and emotional bond with their mother. The author's frustration is valid, but the way they expressed it might not be constructive. Instead of pointing out the mother's shortcomings, maybe the author should focus on their own role as a supportive parent and let the kids form their own opinions about their mother.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's situation is understandable, their approach in responding to the daughter's question might be inappropriate. They are in the wrong because they risk damaging the child's relationship with the other parent, even if their intentions were to highlight their own contributions.\n"
