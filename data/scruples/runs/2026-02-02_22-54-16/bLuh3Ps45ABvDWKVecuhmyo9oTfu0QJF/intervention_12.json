She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a stepfather who's been taking care of his kids full-time, providing everything they need. He has a history with his ex-wife, who he describes as a problematic parent. The kids see their mom as a hero, which he finds frustrating because he's the one doing most of the work.\n\nHe talks about how he's never insulted their mom, but he's upset that the kids don't appreciate what he and his wife are doing. When his daughter asks about her pageant question, he responds by pointing out the reality of their living situation. The key here is whether his response was appropriate.\n\nHe didn't directly say negative things about the ex, but he highlighted the contrast between the two environments. He made the daughter aware that her mom's parenting is part-time and easier. The user is asking if he's in the wrong. \n\nThe question is about whether it's okay to express frustration about the kids idolizing the ex when the stepfamily is doing all the work. He's not badmouthing her, just providing perspective. The daughter is eight, so maybe she's not yet aware of the complexities. The stepfather's approach might be seen as trying to balance the daughter's perception rather than letting her have an unrealistic view of the mother. \n\nBut does that make him wrong? He's trying to manage the child's expectations and appreciation for what he and his wife do. However, he's not directly attacking the mother, so maybe it's justifiable. His main issue is the daughter's hero choice, so he's giving her context to make an informed decision. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because he's addressing the child's question honestly, explaining the realities without badmouthing the ex. He's trying to help the child understand the situation, not to hurt the ex. So the answer is B.\n"
