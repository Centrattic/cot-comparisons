She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole for resenting that their kids see their mom as a hero, even though the mom is a problematic ex. The user is a stepdad who's been taking care of the kids since the ex left, while the mom has a history of jail time, affairs, job loss, and lives with her mom. He's supportive, but the kids still idolize their biological mom.\n\nHe had a conversation with his daughter where she asked if she should name her mom as her hero. He explained that the stepdad and his wife take care of the kids full-time, providing everything, while the mom only sees them part-time. The user is frustrated that the kids don't appreciate what their stepmom and he do.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider if his frustration is justified. The mom has a problematic history, and the stepdad is providing all the care. But the kids are still bonding with their biological mom, which is natural. The stepdad didn't denigrate the ex, just expressed his feelings. He's trying to balance between not hurting his daughter and feeling unappreciated. \n\nHowever, the way he phrased the response might come across as undermining the kids' feelings. Telling the daughter to question her mother's hero status because of the circumstances could make the kids feel torn between their mom and stepdad. It's a sensitive situation. \n\nBut the user's main point is resentment over the kids' admiration for the mom despite her shortcomings. The stepdad is trying to correct the kids' perception, not out of malice, but because he feels unappreciated. However, kids often have a natural attachment to their biological parents, even if parents are flawed. The stepdad's frustration is valid because he's providing care, but it's important not to belittle the kids' feelings toward their mom. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Maybe he's not in the wrong because he's trying to be fair and not badmouth the mother, but he's also expressing his feelings of underappreciation. However, the way he's approaching it might not be the healthiest. It's possible that the stepdad isn't in the wrong because the mother's actions are problematic, but he could be approaching the situation more constructively. \n\nAlternatively, the kids have a right to feel close to their mom, even if she's not perfect. The stepdad's frustration is understandable, but he needs to find a way to validate the kids' feelings without undermining their mom. So maybe the answer is B (No), he's not in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in how he handles it.\n"
