She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for resenting that their children see their ex-wife as a hero, despite the author's and their new wife's efforts. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a single dad who had a difficult time with his ex-wife: she has a history of jail, affairs, job losses, and can't support herself. He took care of the kids for three years, remarried, and now they provide everything. They pay for healthcare, school, activities, etc. He doesn't ask for child support because his ex can't afford it. Now, when his daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should say her mom is her hero, he expresses frustration about the ex being seen as a hero when they do so much.\n\nHe didn't criticize the ex, but he pointed out the disparity. The question is whether he was wrong to feel that way and act that way.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, is he wrong? Well, he's justified in being frustrated. The ex isn't contributing, yet the kids idealize her. But the way he responded to the daughter might be an issue. He brought up the other parent's shortcomings, which could affect the kids' perception. Even though he didn't directly put her down, he implied that her role is easier. That might be undermining the ex mom in front of the kids, which could be harmful. \n\nBut on the other hand, he's a parent who's been doing a lot for the kids, and it's natural to feel unappreciated. The children might not understand the complexities. The challenge is balancing the kids' relationship with both parents without making the kids feel caught in the middle. \n\nThe key points here are whether he crossed a line. The user thinks he's not wrong, but the answer could be either way. If he's not in the wrong, it's because he's protecting his own contributions. But if he's in the wrong, it's because he's influencing the kids against the other parent. \n\nIn family law and child custody, it's generally advised not to badmouth the other parent in front of the kids, as it can create loyalty conflicts. Even if the ex isn't a good parent, the focus should be on the children's well-being. The author's response might not be outright abusive, but it could be seen as undermining the ex's role, which could be detrimental to the kids. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the author's actions are considered harmful. The user's opinion is that the author isn't wrong, but others might argue that he is. Considering all this, I think the answer is B (No), because while his frustration is valid, the way he handled the situation might not be constructive. However, the question is specifically about being in the wrong, which is more about moral judgment. Since he didn't directly criticize the ex, but pointed out the disparity, it's a bit of a gray area. But leaning towards B because the author's intentions were to set the record straight without being malicious.\n"
