She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a man who was a single dad for three years, now remarried, providing for his kids. His ex-wife is described as having multiple issues\u2014jail time, affairs, job losses, living with her mom. He doesn't ask for child support because she can't support herself. Now, he's frustrated that his kids, especially his daughter, see their mom as a hero despite her problems.\n\nHe talks about a situation where his daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should say her mom is her hero. The author responds by pointing out that they provide for the kids, pay for activities, etc., and that their mom only sees them every other weekend with no chores. He's not trying to badmouth the ex-wife but is frustrated that the kids don't appreciate what he and his stepmom do.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to answer A or B. Let me break it down. The key points here are the father's frustration, his efforts, and how he expressed it. The question is whether his response was wrong.\n\nFirst, the father has a valid reason for feeling resentful. His ex is not contributing financially, has a problematic history, and the kids still idolize her. The father is trying to make the kids aware of the reality without directly attacking the ex. He's explaining the situation in a way that helps the daughter understand the context of their mother's role versus what he and his wife do. \n\nHe didn't tell the daughter not to say her mom is a hero, but he's pointing out the differences in their living situations. It's about perspective rather than outright criticism. He's trying to balance the daughter's admiration with the reality that their mom isn't as involved in the daily struggles of parenting. \n\nIs there a problem here? Maybe the father could have handled it differently, like discussing values of family and support without comparing the two. However, he's not belittling the ex-wife directly but explaining his own role. The frustration is understandable given the circumstances. The author's main issue is that the kids don't recognize his and his wife's efforts.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and fairness. The father's intent isn't to harm the kids' relationship with their mom but to ensure they understand the full picture. He's not the one providing consistent care, so it's reasonable to feel that his contributions should be acknowledged. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (No, he's not in the wrong). The father is justified in feeling frustrated and is trying to guide his daughter to understand the complexities of their family situation without being malicious towards the ex-wife.\n"
