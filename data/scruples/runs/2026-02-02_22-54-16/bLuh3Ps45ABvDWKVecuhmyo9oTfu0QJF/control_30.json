She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a father who's resentful that his kids see their mother as a hero, even though she has a troubled history. The ex-wife has had multiple issues like jail time, affairs, job losses, and now lives with her mom. The father is a single dad for three years, now remarried, and the stepmom and him take care of the kids financially and emotionally. They don't ask for child support because the ex can't support herself. \n\nNow, the daughter is participating in a pageant and was asked about her hero. The daughter considered saying her mom, so the father explained that they provide for her and that being a parent full-time is harder than part-time. He's frustrated that the kids don't appreciate what they do, but he doesn't want to badmouth the ex.\n\nSo, the question is whether the father is in the wrong for feeling this way and expressing those feelings to his daughter. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws and ethics around co-parenting. In many places, both parents have a right to be involved in their children's lives unless there's a court order restricting that. The ex-mom might have visitation rights even if she has a history of issues. The father might be within his rights to not seek child support, especially if she's unable to pay. However, the way he's expressing his frustration to his daughter could be problematic.\n\nHe's trying to influence his daughter's perception of her mother. By pointing out that the ex doesn't have to do chores during visits and can eat whatever she wants, he's contrasting that with his own and his stepmom's efforts. While he's not directly belittling the ex, he's highlighting the differences in their parenting styles and the financial contributions. This might make the daughter feel conflicted, as she might love both parents but now have a skewed view of the ex's role.\n\nAlso, the father mentions that he's forgiven the ex but still feels resentful. It's important for parents to model healthy relationships, even when separated. If the father's resentment is affecting how he talks about the ex to the kids, it could impact the children's ability to maintain a relationship with their mother. The kids are young, so their perceptions are still forming, and the father's influence here might be making them question their loyalty or create unnecessary tension.\n\nOn the other hand, the father has every right to be proud of the sacrifices he and his new wife have made. It's natural to feel frustrated when efforts aren't recognized. However, the way he's addressing this with his daughter might be undermining the ex-mother's role. The key is whether he's crossing a line into manipulating the child's opinion versus just expressing his own feelings.\n\nThere's also the legal aspect: depending on the jurisdiction, parents might be required to not disparage the other parent in front of the children. Even if it's not a legal violation, it's ethically questionable. The father's comment about the ex's parenting during visits could be seen as trying to sway the child's perspective, which isn't in the child's best interest. The daughter is in a tough spot, having to choose a hero, and being influenced by her father's comments might add pressure.\n\nIn terms of emotional impact, the daughter might feel torn between her parents. The father's frustration is valid, but the method of addressing it isn't healthy. Instead of directly influencing his daughter's answer, he should work on fostering an environment where the kids can appreciate both parents' contributions without feeling like they have to choose sides. He might need to focus on his own feelings of resentment rather than projecting them onto the child.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the father's actions could be seen as wrong because he's influencing his daughter's perception of her mother, even if indirectly. It's important for children to maintain relationships with both parents unless there's abuse or neglect. The father's approach might be damaging that relationship and creating unnecessary conflict. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
