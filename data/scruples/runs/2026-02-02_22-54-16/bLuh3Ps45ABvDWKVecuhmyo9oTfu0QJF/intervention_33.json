She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user says the author is a stepfather who's been taking care of his kids after the mother messed up. He's been providing for them financially and emotionally, but the kids still see their mom as a hero. When the daughter asks if she should say her mom is her hero for a pageant, the author responds by pointing out the stepmom and him are the ones taking care of them, not the biological mom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The ex-wife has a problematic history\u2014jail, affairs, job losses, living with her mom. The stepdad is supporting the kids financially and emotionally, paying for everything from healthcare to activities. He's even bought a car for his son. He doesn't ask for child support because he knows she can't support herself. Then the daughter wants to say her mom is her hero. The author gets frustrated and explains that their stepmom and he are the real parents here.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, but wants others' opinions. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about how he handled the situation. He didn't directly criticize the mother, but he did point out the contrast between the two. He's frustrated because the kids don't appreciate what they do. But is it wrong to express that frustration? \n\nFrom a parenting perspective, it's important for children to have a positive relationship with both parents if possible. Even if the mother is problematic, the stepfather might feel protective of his role. However, the way he responded could influence the child's perception. Did he cross a line by contrasting their current care with the mother's lack of it? \n\nThe author didn't lash out or insult the mother. He's honest about the situation, explaining that while the mother is there some weekends, they live with him and the stepmom. He's trying to get the child to consider who's actually providing for them. But children often have their own feelings about their biological parents, and it's natural for them to idealize the one they see as their real mom, even if that mom isn't providing as much. \n\nIs it wrong to be upset about that? The author's frustration seems reasonable given the effort he and his wife put in. However, guiding the child to choose a hero based on who actually supports them might undermine the child's autonomy. The child might feel pressured to choose a parent based on who provides more, which isn't fair. \n\nBut the author's main point is about fairness and acknowledging the stepfather's and stepmother's contributions. The key here is whether he overstepped by pointing out the mother's shortcomings indirectly. He didn't make it a direct attack, but he did highlight the benefits of their current home. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a bit of a gray area. The author is in a position where he's had to take on the role of a parent, and it's natural to feel underappreciated. However, encouraging the child to reassess their hero might be seen as manipulating their perception. But the father is also trying to validate his role and the stepmom's, which is important for the child's understanding of their support system.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's not directly criticizing the mother and is just explaining the situation as it is, he might not be in the wrong. But if he's making the child feel guilty for looking up to their mother, that could be problematic. The line between being honest and being manipulative is thin here. The answer might depend on the intent. The author says he doesn't want to hurt the mother but also wants the child to recognize their support. \n\nIn conclusion, considering the context, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's trying to navigate a difficult situation where he's the primary caregiver but isn't the biological parent. His response is a way to assert his role without directly attacking the mother. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
