She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The key points here are the parent's frustration over their children idolizing their ex-wife, who has a history of negative behavior, while the stepmother and current father are providing for the kids. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of co-parenting. The stepmom and the new husband are doing a lot for the kids\u2014paying for healthcare, activities, school projects, etc. They also don't ask for child support because the ex can't support herself. The father is trying to be fair and forgiving.\n\nThe daughter is about to enter a pageant and is considering naming her biological mother as her hero. The stepdad questions this, pointing out that they are the ones who care for the kids full-time, while the ex only sees them two weekends a month. But he's careful not to badmouth the ex directly.\n\nNow, the question is whether the stepdad is in the wrong. The user is asking for a judgment based on the scenario. The stepdad isn't belittling the ex in front of the child directly but is expressing frustration that the kids don't appreciate the stepmom's efforts. He's trying to guide the child towards a more realistic view. \n\nI should consider if it's wrong to feel resentful in this situation. The stepdad is in a position where he's making sacrifices, and it's natural to feel underappreciated. However, the way he's approaching it\u2014by questioning the daughter's choice without attacking the mother\u2014might be appropriate. He's not forcing the child to say something, just making her aware of the other parent's role.\n\nOn the other hand, is there a right or wrong here? The ex might be seen as a neglectful parent, but the children might still idealize her. The stepdad's frustration is valid, but he's not in the wrong for wanting the kids to recognize the support they receive. Since he's not directly criticizing the ex and is trying to educate the child, maybe he's justified. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no element of manipulation or undermining the ex. The stepdad is trying to balance the child's perspective without being negative. So, probably B.\n"
