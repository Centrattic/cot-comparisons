She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a father who's frustrated that his children see their mother as a hero, despite her being a problematic parent. The ex is described as having a history of jail time, affairs, job losses, and living with her mom. The author and his current wife have been taking care of the kids, providing everything they need, and even paying for their mother's child support. \n\nThe daughter is about to enter a pageant and asks if she should say her mom is her hero. The father responds by pointing out that they take care of the kids and that their mother only sees them every other weekend, implying that it's easier to be a parent part-time. The father doesn't want to badmouth the ex but is frustrated that the kids don't acknowledge their stepmom and him.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The father's response was a direct answer to his daughter's question. He didn't outright lie or make a harsh comment but gave his perspective on the situation. He's trying to get the daughter to consider the reality of their living situations. However, he's also trying to balance not wanting to hurt the kids' perception of their mother while expressing his frustration.\n\nFrom a parenting perspective, it's common for children to have a positive view of their biological parents, even if they're not ideal. The father's frustration is understandable, especially given the sacrifices he and his stepmom have made. But in his response, did he cross a line? Maybe he could have approached it differently, like encouraging the daughter to think about what qualities make someone a hero without undermining the ex. However, he didn't directly attack the ex, just highlighted the differences in their parenting roles. \n\nIt's possible that the father's frustration led him to voice his feelings in a way that could be seen as dismissive of the kids' attachment to their mother. But considering the context of the ex's history and the father's efforts, maybe his reaction is justified. The key point is whether he was wrong to express his feelings in that moment. Since he wasn't malicious or harmful, just honest about the situation, it's more of a B (not in the wrong). The answer hinges on whether his response was appropriate, given the circumstances. He's trying to guide his daughter's thinking without being negative towards the ex. While there might be room for a more neutral approach, the intent wasn't to harm but to clarify the situation.\n"
