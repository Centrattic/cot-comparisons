She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for resenting that their kids see their ex-wife as a hero.\n\nFirst, the ex-wife has a history of problems: jail, affairs, job issues, and living with her mom. The author, a single dad for three years, now remarried, takes care of the kids financially and emotionally. They pay for everything from healthcare to activities, even a car for his son. He doesn't ask for child support. Then, when his daughter asks about a pageant question about heroes, he responds by pointing out the ex's easier parenting role. He's frustrated because the kids see the ex as an angel and don't appreciate what he and his stepmom do.\n\nSo the main question is whether his response was wrong. He didn't directly attack the ex, but he's expressing frustration. He wants the kids to appreciate their current caregivers but is upset that they revere the ex. \n\nOn one hand, it's understandable he's frustrated. He's doing a lot for the kids. On the other hand, maybe he overstepped by bringing up the ex's shortcomings, even indirectly. But he didn't tell the daughter not to mention her mom; he just explained the different situations. He's not badmouthing the ex, just highlighting the reality.\n\nI think the key here is whether his response was unkind or unfair. He's being honest about the ex's parenting role and his own family's support. He's trying to help the daughter understand the context. Since he's not attacking the ex directly and is trying to help the daughter see the bigger picture, maybe he's not in the wrong. The ex's actions (like using food stamps) are part of the reality. The author is trying to balance his daughter's admiration for the ex with the reality that he and his stepmom are the ones providing consistently. \n\nSo I think the answer is B; he's not in the wrong.\n"
