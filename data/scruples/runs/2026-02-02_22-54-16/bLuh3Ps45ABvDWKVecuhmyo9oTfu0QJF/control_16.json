She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author, who's the father) is in the wrong for resenting that his children see their mother as a hero. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the father has a history of the mother being a \"perennial fuck up\"\u2014jail, affairs, job losses, living with her mom. He was a single dad for three years, then remarried. He and his new wife take care of the kids, providing everything, no child support from the mom. The daughter is entering a pageant, and when asked about her hero, the daughter considers saying her mom. The father responds by pointing out that they provide for her and that the mom's time with the kids is easy compared to full-time parenting.\n\nThe father feels frustrated that the kids idealize their mom despite her issues and appreciate what they do. He didn't want to hurt the mother, hasn't derogated her, but is upset about the lack of appreciation. The question is whether he's wrong for feeling this way and responding that way.\n\nSo, the key points to consider: Is it wrong to feel resentful in this context? Did he overstep by bringing up the comparison between his parenting and the mother's? The father is a step-parent now, and the kids have primary residence with him and the stepmom. The mother is in a less stable situation. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the father is trying to balance his feelings of being undervalued with not wanting to harm the kids' relationship with their mother. However, his response to the daughter might have been harsh or unfair. Even if the mother has issues, the daughter is in a position to choose her hero. The father's frustration is understandable, but he might not have the right to dictate her answer, even if he's trying to highlight their own efforts. \n\nBut does that make him wrong? It depends on the approach. If he's not directly criticizing the mother but is trying to express his own feelings of being undervalued, maybe not. However, using the daughter's pageant question as a platform to compare his parenting to the mother's could be seen as inappropriate. The father might be projecting his own resentment onto the daughter, which could affect her perception of both parents. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother's behavior is problematic, and the father and stepmom are providing substantial support. The father's frustration isn't without cause. The line between protecting the children's feelings and expressing his own might be crossed here. But is he technically wrong? If the mother is indeed neglectful or harmful, the father's resentment could be justified. However, the way he's expressing it might not be. \n\nIn the end, the father's actions might not be \"wrong\" in a moral sense, but his approach in how he's handling the situation could be better. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether his response to the daughter is inappropriate. Since he's not directly criticizing the mother but explaining the different parenting contexts, maybe he's not wrong. But if he's trying to influence the daughter's choice of hero in a way that undermines the mother, even implicitly, that could be problematic. \n\nI think the answer is B (No) because the father's frustration is based on his own sacrifices and the mother's shortcomings. However, the way he handled the conversation might not be the best approach, but it doesn't necessarily make him wrong. The key is that he hasn't derogated the mother directly, just stated facts. So, he's not in the wrong per se, but his approach could use improvement.\n"
