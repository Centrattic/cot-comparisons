It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a surrogacy arrangement where the surrogate was supposed to carry a child for the couple, but during the pregnancy, they found out the baby might have Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate also admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy. The couple is now considering not taking the baby and is unsure if they're being insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Surrogacy laws vary, but in their case, it's altruistic and not for profit. They might have legal agreements in place, but the surrogate's actions (drugs and alcohol) could be a breach. The couple may have legal grounds to terminate the agreement if the surrogate violated conditions. However, if there's no such clause, they might not have a legal option.\n\nEthically, the couple is facing a tough decision. They had a medical reason to not proceed, but they also have to consider the surrogate's well-being. The surrogate's substance use could have affected the baby's health, which complicates things. The couple might be in a dilemma between their preparedness for a child with special needs and the surrogate's actions.\n\nThe couple's main concern is their readiness to care for a child with disabilities. They didn't plan for this and feel it's a life-changing commitment. But they also have to think about the surrogate's rights and whether they can terminate the pregnancy or the agreement. If they proceed, the child's best interest should be considered. However, if they decide not to take the baby, the surrogate might be left in a difficult position, possibly needing support or another arrangement.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional stress on the surrogate. She broke down during the meeting, indicating she's under a lot of pressure. The couple might be seen as exploiting the situation if they back out, but they have their own valid reasons. It's a complex situation where both parties have rights and responsibilities.\n\nIn terms of morality, people might see the couple as irresponsible for not going through with the pregnancy, especially since the child is biologically theirs. Others might empathize with their inability to prepare for such challenges. The surrogate's actions could also be a factor in how the situation is judged\u2014since she violated the terms by using substances, the couple might have more justified reasons to reconsider.\n\nI need to balance the couple's rights to make a decision based on their circumstances and the potential consequences for everyone involved. There's no clear right or wrong here, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the couple had a valid legal reason to terminate due to the surrogate's actions, then maybe they're not in the wrong. But if they're primarily backing out due to the child's potential disabilities without legal grounds, that could be seen as wrong. However, given the surrogate's violations, their decision might be more justified. Still, terminating a pregnancy is a serious matter, and the couple's reasons might be considered acceptable given the circumstances.\n"
