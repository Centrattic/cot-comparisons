It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple using a surrogate, who later admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy. The baby might have Down syndrome and spina bifida. The couple is now considering refusing the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The user mentioned that surrogacy for profit is illegal in their country, so it's purely altruistic. That might mean different legal obligations compared to commercial surrogacy. In some countries, if the surrogate is altruistic, the legal process might be different. If the pregnancy is not yet at a point where termination is legally possible, they might be stuck. But the surrogate's behavior (smoking and drinking) could be a legal issue. Did they have any contract or agreement in place? If the surrogate violated the terms by using substances, maybe there are grounds to terminate the arrangement.\n\nEthically, this is tricky. The couple might feel they're not ready for a child with disabilities, but they also had a choice to proceed with the surrogacy. The surrogate's actions could have harmed the fetus, but she might be under stress. They might feel responsible for the situation, but the surrogate's behavior complicates things. The couple's main concern is their ability to care for a child with these conditions. They might not be in the wrong for re-evaluating, especially if they weren't prepared for the responsibilities. However, backing out after this point could leave the surrogate with a child they don't want, which raises ethical concerns about the surrogate's rights and the child's future.\n\nAlso, the part where they mention the surrogate \"toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them\" is harsh. It suggests they blame her for the situation, but the original issue was their own decision to use a surrogate and the surrogate's undisclosed behavior. The couple might not be in the wrong if the surrogate violated agreed-upon terms, but they could also be seen as irresponsible for not having proper safeguards in place. \n\nLegally, depending on the jurisdiction, the couple might have options if the surrogate breached the agreement. But ethically, walking away from a child, regardless of circumstances, might be viewed differently. They should consider the child's best interest and their own readiness. If they can't provide the necessary care, perhaps they should not proceed, but they also need to consider the surrogate's situation and the potential legal consequences.\n\nIn summary, the answer hinges on legal rights and ethical responsibilities. If the surrogate's actions made the pregnancy non-viable or breached her agreement, the couple might not be in the wrong. However, the decision to refuse the child after this point could be seen as abandoning a vulnerable life, which might be ethically questionable. The answer isn't straightforward, but considering the legal and ethical angles, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because they were unaware of the surrogate's behavior and the child's condition, and they're making a difficult choice based on their circumstances. However, they should have legal recourse if the surrogate violated terms, which might absolve them of wrongdoing.\n"
