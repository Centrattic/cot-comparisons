It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation involves a surrogacy arrangement where the surrogate has been smoking and drinking during the pregnancy. The parents-to-be found out the fetus has a high chance of Down syndrome (DS) and spina bifida (SB). They're considering not wanting the baby anymore and are unsure if they can refuse it. The question is whether they are the ones in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In the scenario, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. That probably means the legal framework is different from commercial surrogacy, which might affect the rights and responsibilities of all parties involved. The surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) could be harmful to the fetus, which is a significant issue. However, the parents are also making a decision based on the potential health of the child and their own readiness to care for a child with special needs.\n\nEthically, the parents are facing a tough choice. They might feel unprepared for a child with DS and SB, which can require significant care and resources. But they also have a responsibility to the child they're bringing into the world. The surrogate's actions could have contributed to the risks, but she might also be under stress and struggling with her own mental health.\n\nThe parents might not be in the wrong if they're making decisions based on their ability to provide care. However, there's a moral obligation to consider the child's future. On the other hand, the surrogate's behavior is problematic because she was entrusted with carrying their biological child and may have endangered the pregnancy.\n\nLegally, the parents might have options to terminate the pregnancy, especially if the surrogate has violated the terms of the surrogacy agreement. But the specifics would depend on local laws. Since the surrogacy is altruistic, the legal terms might not be as clear as in commercial cases.\n\nEmotionally, the parents are conflicted. They might feel guilty for considering not wanting the child, but they're also realistic about their capacity to care for a child with such conditions. The surrogate's breakdown suggests she's also under pressure, which complicates the situation.\n\nIn terms of being \"the assholes,\" it's tricky. The parents are making a decision based on their own limitations and the surrogate's actions. But the surrogate's behavior might have contributed to the situation. The key points are the surrogate's responsibility versus the parents' right to make decisions about their child's future.\n\nI think the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, because they're facing a difficult situation with a child that may have significant needs. However, the surrogate's actions do play a role. But the parents have the right to consider their own capacity to parent, and if they feel they can't provide for the child's needs, it's a personal decision. However, there's also the aspect of the surrogate's responsibility and the ethical duty to the child. It's a complex case, but I'm leaning towards B, not in the wrong, because the parents are making a personal choice based on their circumstances and the surrogate's actions may have impacted the pregnancy.\n"
