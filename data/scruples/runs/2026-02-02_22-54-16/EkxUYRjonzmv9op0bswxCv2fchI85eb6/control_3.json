It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a surrogacy arrangement where the surrogate has been smoking and drinking during pregnancy, and the parents-to-be found out that the baby has a high chance of Down Syndrome and spina bifida. They're considering not taking the baby now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The surrogacy is altruistic since it's illegal for profit in their country. The surrogate broke the agreement by using substances, which could endanger the baby. The parents might have the legal right to terminate the pregnancy if the surrogate's actions compromised the child's health. But there's also the ethical side: choosing not to take the baby because of disabilities raises questions about societal views on disability and the value of life. However, the parents are also under no obligation to raise a child they didn't anticipate needing long-term care. The surrogate's actions are definitely a problem, as she's risking the child's health. The key factors here are the legality of the surrogacy, the health risks from the surrogate's behavior, and the parents' right to make decisions about their family. The parents aren't in the wrong if they choose not to proceed, especially given the surrogate's violations and the unexpected challenges of raising a child with disabilities. So the answer would be B.\n"
