It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves surrogacy, a medical issue with the fetus, and the surrogate's behavior during pregnancy.\n\nFirst, the couple tried for years to have a child, and due to medical issues, they used a surrogate. The surrogate is in the third trimester (5 months). They had an amniocentesis that showed a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. Then the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking, which is concerning.\n\nThe couple is now considering refusing the baby, feeling overwhelmed by the potential lifelong caregiving required. They're worried about being seen as insensitive but are also concerned about the surrogate's actions affecting the child.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the couple's right to terminate the pregnancy due to new information, the surrogate's breach of medical protocol, and ethical considerations of surrogacy.\n\nLegally, in altruistic surrogacy (which is illegal for profit in their country), the laws can vary. In some places, the intended parents might have options to terminate if the surrogate's actions endanger the baby. However, since the surrogate is 5 months pregnant, options might be limited. Medically, the fetus's conditions and the surrogate's substance use complicate things.\n\nEthically, the couple might feel they're not prepared for the challenges of raising a child with disabilities. However, they chose surrogacy knowing the risks, and maybe they should have considered these possibilities beforehand. The surrogate's actions are definitely a problem, but that doesn't necessarily absolve the couple of responsibility once the pregnancy is underway.\n\nThe question is whether they're in the wrong for wanting to refuse the baby now. If the surrogate's actions contributed to the baby's health issues, maybe the couple has a right to reconsider. However, terminating at 5 months for non-medical reasons (like the child's disabilities) might be ethically contentious. They might be seen as making a choice based on the child's potential needs rather than the child's well-being.\n\nAlso, the surrogate's health choices could lead to legal issues. The couple might have a right to report her actions, which could affect the pregnancy. But if they proceed with the pregnancy, they might have to care for a child with disabilities they didn't anticipate. It's a tough spot.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the couple might not be in the wrong if they can show that they made an informed decision after new information came to light. However, their decision to not proceed could be seen as selfish if they're terminating solely due to the child's disabilities. But considering the surrogate's misconduct, maybe they have a stronger case.\n\nSo, balancing all factors, maybe the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're facing unexpected circumstances and the surrogate's actions added another layer. However, the decision to terminate based on disabilities could be ethically debatable. But the user is asking for a yes/no answer based on the situation as described. The user's tone suggests they feel conflicted but are considering the surrogate's actions as a contributing factor. So, I think the answer leans towards B.\n"
