It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves surrogacy, unexpected medical issues in the fetus, and the surrogate's misconduct.\n\nFirst, the couple went through surrogacy because the wife couldn't carry a pregnancy. The baby is biologically theirs. Now, the amniocentesis shows a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking, which is concerning.\n\nThe couple is considering not wanting the baby anymore. The key points here are the legal and ethical implications. Since surrogacy is altruistic and not for profit, the legal terms might be different. They need to check the surrogacy agreement. If there's a clause about such conditions, that could guide their decision. \n\nEthically, the couple is facing a tough choice. They didn't anticipate the health issues and feel unprepared for the lifelong care required. The surrogate's actions add another layer of complexity. However, the child's well-being is also important, and terminating the pregnancy later might be an option, but they're worried about the timing (5 months in). \n\nThe user is torn between their own readiness and the surrogate's actions. They fear being seen as insensitive, but they're not sure what their options are. The question is whether they're in the wrong for considering refusing the child. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, without specific clauses in the surrogacy agreement, they might not have grounds to back out. The surrogate's behavior could be a breach of the agreement, which might allow them to terminate the arrangement, but that's something to discuss with legal counsel. Ethically, it's a complex issue. While they have the right to make decisions about their family, the surrogate's actions raise concerns about the child's health. \n\nThe couple's feelings of being unprepared and overwhelmed are valid. They might need time to process, but they also have a responsibility to ensure the child's best interests. The answer depends on the surrogacy agreement's terms and the legal framework in their country. If the agreement allows for termination in such cases, then they might not be in the wrong. However, if they proceed without addressing the surrogate's actions and the child's potential needs, it could be seen as irresponsible. \n\nIn summary, without more information on the legal aspects of their surrogacy agreement, it's hard to definitively say if they're in the wrong. They should consult legal experts to understand their options and responsibilities. Ethically, they need to balance their preparedness with the child's well-being and the surrogate's breach of trust.\n"
