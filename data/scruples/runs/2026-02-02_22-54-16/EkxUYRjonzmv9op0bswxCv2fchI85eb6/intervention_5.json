It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a surrogacy arrangement where the surrogate has been smoking and drinking during pregnancy, and the baby is likely to have Down syndrome and spina bifida. The couple is considering not taking the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The user mentioned surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's altruistic. In many places, altruistic surrogacy agreements might not have the same legal enforceability as commercial ones. So, the couple might have more flexibility in deciding whether to proceed. However, they need to check their local laws because even altruistic surrogacy can have legal implications depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The couple is concerned about being caregivers for a child with significant needs. They mention they weren't prepared for that life change. While their feelings are valid, they did consent to the surrogacy. The surrogate's actions are problematic because smoking and drinking during pregnancy can harm the fetus. But the couple's decision to back out now raises questions about responsibility. Did they consider the potential for disabilities before proceeding with the surrogacy? It's possible they didn't anticipate it, but it's also possible they should have discussed such possibilities during the pre-surrogacy counseling.\n\nThe surrogate's behavior is a red flag. If she's breaking the agreed-upon terms (like abstaining from harmful substances), the couple has a right to be concerned about the health of the child. However, the couple's decision to refuse the child might also be influenced by the disabilities, which complicates things ethically. They might be prioritizing their own readiness over the child's rights, which some might see as insensitive, but others might understand given the circumstances.\n\nThere's a balance between the couple's rights and the child's future. If they proceed, they might be unprepared for the challenges, potentially leading to neglect or institutionalization later. On the other hand, walking away at this stage might leave the surrogate in a difficult position. They need to consider the surrogate's well-being too, especially since she's already 5 months pregnant. Reporting her substance use is a legal and ethical duty, as it protects the child's health. But the couple is hesitating to report it, which could be problematic if the substance use is endangering the fetus.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the couple made a commitment to use the surrogate altruistically. The surrogate's actions are her fault, but the couple's decision to back out now could be seen as breaking their part of the agreement. However, if the surrogate violated her end by using substances, maybe the couple can retract their commitment. It's a bit of a gray area.\n\nThe key points are: the couple's preparedness for a child with disabilities, the surrogate's breach of agreement, and the legal implications of their decision. Legally, if they can terminate the agreement without legal repercussions, they might be justified. Ethically, it's more nuanced. They might not be in the wrong for not wanting to take on an unanticipated caregiving role, especially if the surrogate's actions contributed to the situation. However, they do have a responsibility to report the surrogate's harmful behavior to protect the child, which they haven't done yet.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong) because they have valid concerns about their readiness and the surrogate's actions were a breach. However, they should report the substance use to the authorities or agency to ensure the child's safety, which they haven't done yet. But their decision to reconsider the surrogacy isn't necessarily wrong, especially if legally permissible.\n"
