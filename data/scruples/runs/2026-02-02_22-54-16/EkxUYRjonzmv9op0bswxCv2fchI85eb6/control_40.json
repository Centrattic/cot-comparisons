It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a surrogacy arrangement where the surrogate was supposed to be altruistic. The couple found out through an amniocentesis that the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. Then, the surrogate revealed she was smoking and drinking during pregnancy, which adds to their dilemma.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The user mentioned that surrogacy for profit is illegal in their country, so it's purely altruistic. This might affect the legal rights and responsibilities of each party. In some jurisdictions, if the surrogate violates the agreement by using substances, the intended parents might have legal grounds to terminate the pregnancy or decline the child. But since it's altruistic, maybe the laws are different. I should check if there's a legal right to refuse the child after a certain point, like after the amniocentesis results.\n\nNext, ethical considerations. The couple is facing a situation where the baby's health could significantly impact their lives. They might feel unprepared for the long-term care of a child with disabilities. However, terminating the pregnancy after it's reached a certain stage could be seen as ethically problematic, especially if the surrogate is in her fifth month. Also, the surrogate's actions\u2014smoking and drinking\u2014could be viewed as a breach of the surrogacy agreement, which might affect the couple's decision.\n\nThe emotional aspect is important too. The couple is stressed about the potential life of the child and their own readiness. The surrogate is under stress too, leading to her coping mechanisms. It's a complex situation where both parties have emotional turmoil.\n\nLegally, in some places, if the surrogate's actions endangered the child, the intended parents might have the right to terminate the pregnancy. However, in many altruistic surrogacy agreements, once the pregnancy is well into the second trimester, the intended parents can't legally terminate it. This might mean the couple is in a difficult position where they can't legally refuse the child, but they also feel it's not in their capacity to care for a child with these conditions.\n\nEthically, some might argue that the couple is making a responsible decision by considering their ability to provide care, while others might see it as abandoning the child due to disabilities. The surrogate's actions complicate things further, as her behavior could contribute to the child's health issues, but she's also a human being who might face consequences if the pregnancy is terminated.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a nuanced issue. If the couple has the legal right to terminate based on the surrogate's breach of the agreement, then they might not be in the wrong. However, if the law doesn't allow termination, their desire to refuse might not be justified ethically. The answer hinges on the legal framework of their jurisdiction and the terms of the surrogacy agreement.\n\nSince the user hasn't provided specific legal details, I need to consider general principles. In many altruistic surrogacy cases, the intended parents can't terminate the pregnancy once it's past a certain point unless there's a medical necessity. If the couple is choosing to terminate not for medical reasons but based on the child's potential disabilities and the surrogate's actions, they might be seen as in the wrong. However, if the surrogate's actions were a breach, and that's a valid reason to terminate, then maybe not.\n\nIn conclusion, without specific legal context, it's hard to say definitively, but ethically and legally, the situation is complex. The couple's decision could be viewed as responsible if the surrogate violated the agreement, but if the decision is solely based on the child's disabilities, that's more controversial. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) if the surrogate's actions justify termination, but A (in the wrong) if not. Since the user is asking for a yes or no, but the scenario is ambiguous, the safest answer might be B, considering the surrogate's breach could affect their decision.\n"
