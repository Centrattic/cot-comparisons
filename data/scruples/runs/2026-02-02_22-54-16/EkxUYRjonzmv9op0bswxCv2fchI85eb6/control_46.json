It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a couple using a surrogate to have a child because the wife has medical issues. They went through a surrogacy process in a place where it's altruistic, not for profit. The surrogate is now five months pregnant, and the baby is their biological child. The amniocentesis results show a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. Then the surrogate reveals she's been smoking and drinking, which adds another layer of stress.\n\nThe couple is considering not wanting the baby anymore because they feel unprepared for the lifelong care that might come with it. They\u2019re also upset that the surrogate might have compromised the pregnancy. The question is whether they\u2019re in the wrong for wanting to terminate or refuse the baby at this point.\n\nI need to consider legal and ethical aspects. In countries where surrogacy is altruistic, there might be specific legal agreements. The surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) could be a breach of the agreement, especially if the contract had terms about health behaviors. Legally, the couple might have grounds to terminate the surrogacy because the surrogate violated the terms, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.\n\nEthically, the couple's decision is complex. They have the right to make medical decisions about their child, but ending a pregnancy after this point might be seen differently depending on cultural and personal beliefs. The fact that the surrogate broke down and was under stress complicates things. Were they properly supported? Did the agency provide adequate support to the surrogate?\n\nThe couple might feel they didn't sign up for the challenges of raising a child with special needs, which is a valid concern. However, they also entered into a surrogacy agreement, and the surrogate's actions could have impacted the pregnancy. But it's also possible that the surrogate's stress wasn't managed properly by the agency, leading to her coping mechanisms.\n\nThe key points here are the legality of termination based on surrogacy contract terms, the ethical implications of making a decision based on the child's potential health issues, and the surrogate's responsibilities. If the surrogacy agreement allows termination in cases of the surrogate's misconduct, then the couple might not be in the wrong. However, if the termination is based purely on the child's health, that could be seen as discriminatory, but it's also a personal choice about their readiness.\n\nAlso, considering the surrogate's well-being and the child's rights is important. The couple needs to consult legal experts to understand their options. They might be within their rights, but there's no clear answer without knowing the exact legal framework in their country. Ethically, it's a tough call, but they might not be in the wrong if they followed proper procedures and made the decision based on the information and circumstances presented.\n"
