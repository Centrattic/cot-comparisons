It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple who used a surrogate because the wife can't carry a pregnancy. Now, the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida, and the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy. The couple is considering not wanting the baby anymore and are worried about being called insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their responsibilities. They went through a surrogacy process, which is a big commitment. The surrogate is altruistic, so it's not a financial arrangement. They had to trust her to take good care of the baby. If she's been using harmful substances, maybe that's a breach of that trust. But legally, in a place where surrogacy is altruistic, there might be different rules. The couple might have limited options now, but they're considering their ability to care for a child with special needs.\n\nThe couple's argument is that they didn't expect this situation and feel unprepared for the long-term commitment of caring for a child with disabilities. They also feel upset that the surrogate's actions may have affected the baby. But, is it their right to refuse the child? If they agreed to surrogacy, they might be bound by the agreement, and walking away could leave the surrogate with a child she didn't intend to parent. However, the surrogate's actions could have endangered the child, so maybe the couple has valid concerns.\n\nEthically, it's a tough call. On one hand, they have the right to make decisions about their family and future. On the other hand, the surrogate is now pregnant, and the child's well-being is a factor. If they proceed, they might be able to provide the best care despite the disabilities, but if they back out, the surrogate would have to raise the child alone or find another arrangement, which is stressful for her. Also, the couple's initial hesitation about being caregivers might be selfish, but they're being honest about their limitations.\n\nLegally, without knowing the specific laws of the country, it's hard to say, but in many places, once a surrogate has carried a child, the intended parents can't back out. So the couple might be legally bound. Emotionally, they're struggling with unexpected circumstances. The surrogate's behavior complicates things further because her actions may have contributed to the issues.\n\nIn summary, the author is in a difficult situation. They might not be in the wrong because they're making a tough decision based on their ability to care for the child and the surrogate's actions. However, they need to consider the legal and ethical implications of walking away. But since the question is whether they're in the wrong, it's a matter of perspective. Some might see their decision as understandable given the circumstances, especially if the surrogate's actions were a violation. Others might argue they should have anticipated risks in surrogacy. I think the answer leans towards B (they're not in the wrong) because they're making a hard choice based on their situation, but it's a close call.\n"
