It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves surrogacy, and the couple is considering refusing the baby after finding out about potential disabilities and the surrogate's substance use.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The couple went through a lot to have a child, and the surrogate was supposed to carry it altruistically. Now, the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The couple feels they aren't prepared for the lifelong care that comes with these conditions. They're also upset because the surrogate used substances during pregnancy, which might have contributed to the issues.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, surrogacy laws can be complex. If surrogacy is altruistic and not for profit, the legal obligations might differ. The couple might have a right to make decisions about the child's future, but there's also the surrogate's role to consider. They haven't reported her substance use yet, which could be a legal issue. The surrogate breaking her agreement by using drugs could affect the couple's rights.\n\nEthically, people have different opinions. Some might say the couple has the right to not have a child they're not prepared for, especially if they're not the biological parents. Others might argue that once a pregnancy is started, the child has a right to be born and cared for, regardless of circumstances. The surrogate's actions complicate matters because her behavior might have impacted the fetus's health.\n\nThe couple's feelings of not being ready and the stress of the situation are valid. They might feel they're making a responsible decision, but others might see it as abandoning a child they created. The surrogate's emotional state and her actions (smoking and drinking) add another layer. She might face consequences, but the couple is also in a tough spot.\n\nI need to check if there's any clear wrongdoer. The surrogate broke the agreed-upon conditions of the surrogacy by using substances, which could be a breach of contract. The couple's decision to not proceed might be justified if they can prove the surrogate's actions affected the pregnancy. However, deciding to terminate or refuse a child after knowing the risks could be seen as insensitive, especially if the child would have a chance at a good life with proper care.\n\nIn summary, the legal and ethical lines are blurry here. The couple's decision might be understandable given the circumstances, but they could be seen as wrong for avoiding responsibility. The surrogate's actions definitely contributed to the problem. The answer hinges on whether the couple's refusal is considered selfish or a responsible choice given the surrogate's breach and their own readiness.\n"
