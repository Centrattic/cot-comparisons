It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThey're trying to decide whether to go through with the pregnancy after finding out the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking, which adds another layer. The question is, are they the asshole for not wanting the baby anymore?\n\nFirst, let's consider surrogacy laws. The user mentioned it's altruistic and for profit is illegal. That probably means there's no financial incentive for the surrogate, which might affect legal rights. In many places, when surrogacy is altruistic, the legal framework can vary. The user might not have legal options to terminate the pregnancy if the surrogate is still carrying it. They need to check their specific laws here.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The parents are worried about the lifelong impact of caring for a child with these conditions. They didn't expect this and aren't ready. But is it selfish? Some people argue that parents have the right to make decisions based on their circumstances. Others might say once they started the process, they're responsible regardless of the outcome. The surrogate's actions (drugs and alcohol) could also be a factor. If she violated agreed-upon terms in the surrogacy agreement, the parents might have grounds to take legal action, but that depends on the contract's terms.\n\nThe surrogate's health choices are concerning. She broke down and admitted to stress. Maybe she's under a lot of pressure, but she's still responsible for her actions. If the surrogacy agreement had rules against substance use, that's a breach. The parents could report her, but they haven't yet. They're in a tough spot between their own readiness and the surrogate's behavior.\n\nAlso, the parents' emotional state is important. They feel they aren't ready to be caregivers for a child with special needs. That's a valid concern. However, deciding not to proceed with the child after it's already conceived raises ethical questions. Some might say they should accept the outcome, but others might agree that they have the right to change their minds, especially with the surrogate's role in the pregnancy complications.\n\nI should also think about the child's welfare. If the parents are not prepared, is it better for the child to be born and then placed elsewhere? But that's a different issue. The immediate question is whether the parents are in the wrong for not wanting the baby now.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical responsibility, the answer might depend on surrogacy laws in their jurisdiction. If they can't terminate and the surrogate is in good standing, the parents might have to take the child. If the surrogate violated the agreement, they might have legal recourse. But without knowing the exact laws, it's hard to say. Ethically, it's a tough call. They might not be in the wrong for their feelings, but they might be in the wrong if they proceed to abandon the child after the surrogate has carried it to term. Alternatively, if they can terminate the pregnancy legally, that's another angle.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer could lean towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're facing unforeseen circumstances and the surrogate's actions may have contributed to the situation. But the parents' decision to not proceed might be seen as abandoning the surrogate and the child, which could be considered wrong. However, given the complexity and the fact that surrogacy laws vary, the answer might be that they're not in the wrong, but they need to handle it legally and ethically.\n"
