It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple using a surrogate to have a child, and they're considering refusing the baby due to the child's potential disabilities and the surrogate's substance use during pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The couple has gone through a lot to have a child via surrogacy in a country where it's altruistic, not for profit. The surrogate is five months pregnant. The amniocentesis results indicate a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida, which the couple didn't expect. Additionally, the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking, which adds another layer of concern.\n\nThe couple is now considering not taking the child, feeling unprepared for the lifelong commitment of caring for a child with those conditions. They didn't report the surrogate's behavior yet because they're unsure of their options. They feel conflicted about being seen as insensitive but are honest about their readiness.\n\nNow, to determine if they're in the wrong. Legally, surrogacy agreements can vary, but in altruistic arrangements, there might not be strict contractual obligations. However, the surrogate is carrying the couple's biological child, so there's an emotional and ethical component. The couple's main concern is their ability to care for a child with disabilities, which is a personal and valid consideration. But the question is about moral wrongdoing, not just legal.\n\nThe surrogate's actions\u2014smoking and drinking during pregnancy\u2014are harmful. However, the couple's decision to not proceed with the birth might be seen as abandoning the child, which is a serious ethical issue. On the other hand, they might be making a responsible decision based on their capacity to care for a child with significant needs.\n\nEthically, it's a tough call. The couple has the right to make decisions about their family and future. They might not be in the wrong for prioritizing their ability to provide adequate care. However, the child's rights and the surrogate's responsibilities also come into play. The couple could explore options like adoption if they decide not to parent the child but want to avoid termination. Terminating the pregnancy might be legally and ethically complex, depending on local laws, especially at five months.\n\nThe surrogate's actions do affect the child's health, but the couple is also considering factors beyond her actions. Their decision isn't solely based on the surrogate's behavior but also the child's potential needs. They might be facing a dilemma between their expectations and the reality of the situation.\n\nIn conclusion, whether they're in the wrong depends on the context. If they proceed with the birth and care for the child, they might be fulfilling their commitment. If they choose not to, they might be prioritizing their readiness. The key is whether they're making a responsible decision while considering all parties' well-being. Given the circumstances, they might not be in the wrong for re-evaluating their decision, especially if they can find a solution that ensures the child's welfare, like adoption.\n"
