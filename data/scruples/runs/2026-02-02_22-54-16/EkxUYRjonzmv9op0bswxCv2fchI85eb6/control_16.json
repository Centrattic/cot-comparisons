It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves surrogacy, a high risk of Down syndrome and spina bifida, and the surrogate using alcohol and tobacco during pregnancy. The couple is considering refusing the baby now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Since surrogacy for profit is illegal in their country, it's altruistic. But what are the legal rights here? Typically, in altruistic surrogacy arrangements, the surrogate may not have financial incentives, but the legal parentage might still be determined by the biological parents. However, laws vary by country, so without specific info, I have to assume the legal parentage is the couple.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The couple is distressed about the potential disabilities. They feel unprepared for the lifelong care that a child with such conditions might require. They also mention the surrogate's substance use, which could affect the child's development. But is it ethical for them to back out now?\n\nThe surrogate's actions\u2014smoking and drinking\u2014are concerning. These can lead to additional health issues for the baby. The couple might feel misled or that the surrogate endangered their child. However, terminating the pregnancy now (at 5 months) might not be an option, especially if the surrogacy contract doesn't allow for termination unless certain conditions are met.\n\nThe couple's feelings are valid. They might not be \"in the wrong\" for feeling unprepared. However, they do have a responsibility to the child once it's born. Refusing the child could mean the surrogate becomes the legal parent, or the child might end up in foster care, which is a serious outcome.\n\nBut wait, if they are the legal parents, can they refuse the child? That might depend on the surrogacy agreement and local laws. If the contract requires them to accept the child regardless of health conditions, they might be legally bound. If not, they might have options, but it's a complex area.\n\nMoral responsibility: Even if legal, is it morally right to back out after a surrogacy process that's already advanced? The surrogate might have emotional and possibly financial ties now, even if it's altruistic. The child's rights are also a factor. Choosing not to parent a child with disabilities could be seen as discriminatory, but the couple's right to make decisions based on their readiness is another aspect.\n\nThe couple's frustration and stress are understandable. They didn't expect this situation and are now dealing with a dilemma. However, the key is whether they have the right to refuse the child after agreeing to surrogacy. If they can legally and ethically choose to end the pregnancy or proceed with the child, but the question is about being \"in the wrong.\"\n\nConsidering all factors, it's a tough call. The author might not be in the wrong legally, but morally, some might argue that once they committed to surrogacy, they're responsible regardless of the child's condition. Others might empathize with their position. The answer would depend on the specific laws and the nuances of the surrogacy agreement. But based on the information given, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong), as they're facing unexpected circumstances and their decision is based on their readiness and the surrogate's actions.\n"
