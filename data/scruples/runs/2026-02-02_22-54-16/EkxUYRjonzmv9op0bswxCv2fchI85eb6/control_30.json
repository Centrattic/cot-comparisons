It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a surrogacy arrangement where the surrogate was supposed to carry the couple's child. They found out the baby has a high chance of Down Syndrome and spina bifida, and the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy. They're considering not taking the baby and wondering if they're the \"assholes\" for that.\n\nFirst, the ethical aspect. Surrogacy laws vary, but in this case, it's altruistic, not for profit. The surrogate's behavior (smoking and drinking) might violate the surrogacy agreement terms, which often require the surrogate to avoid harmful substances. So legally, the couple might have grounds to terminate the arrangement if the surrogate breached the contract. But emotionally, it's a tough spot for everyone involved.\n\nThen there's the moral question. The couple is concerned about being caregivers for a child with significant needs. They admit they didn't anticipate this and aren't ready. It's their right to consider their own capacity to care for a child with special needs. However, the decision to not want the child after it's already in development raises ethical concerns. The surrogate's actions might have contributed to the baby's health issues, so there's a question about responsibility.\n\nThe surrogate's actions are problematic. If she knew she was pregnant and chose to use harmful substances, she's at fault. The couple is reacting to both the health issues and the surrogate's negligence. But they might still feel they have a choice here if the surrogacy contract allows for termination under such circumstances.\n\nLegally, in some jurisdictions, surrogacy agreements might include provisions for termination if the surrogate violates health terms. If that's the case, the couple isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, if the contract doesn't cover that, they might face legal challenges in terminating the pregnancy.\n\nThe couple's hesitation to report the surrogate to the agency shows they're aware of the complexities. They're not malicious; they're worried about their ability to care for the child. It's a difficult situation, and their decision could be seen as self-preservation rather than being insensitive.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the surrogate broke the agreement, the couple isn't at fault. But if the surrogacy contract didn't account for such scenarios, the situation becomes more ambiguous. The couple's primary issue is with the unforeseen circumstances and the surrogate's actions, which they feel have put the child at risk. Their decision is based on their capacity to care for the child, which is a valid consideration, even if it's hard to admit.\n\nSo, weighing all factors, the answer would depend on the legal terms of the surrogacy agreement and the ethical stance on terminating a pregnancy in such circumstances. But given the surrogate's breach of health terms, the couple's decision might be justified, so they aren't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
