It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for considering refusing the baby after finding out about the health issues and the surrogate's behavior. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The couple went through surrogacy because the wife couldn't conceive. The surrogate is pregnant with their biological child. Now, testing shows Down syndrome and spina bifida, and the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy. The couple is conflicted about whether they can withdraw, and they're worried about being seen as insensitive.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me consider the ethical angles. On one hand, the couple had a medical procedure showing the baby might have serious conditions. They might not be prepared for the lifelong care that comes with these conditions. Also, the surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) could be seen as harmful, especially since she's not the biological parent. \n\nBut on the other hand, surrogacy agreements are usually legal contracts. If they proceed with the pregnancy and then refuse the child, that could leave the surrogate in a difficult position, and the child's future uncertain. Also, the couple might be making a decision based on their own readiness rather than the child's best interests. However, they are considering that they might not be able to provide the necessary care, which is a valid concern. \n\nLegally, in altruistic surrogacy where profit isn't involved, the laws can be murky. If the couple can terminate the agreement now, that might be an option. But if not, they might be obligated to proceed. The surrogate's actions raise questions about her responsibility, but that's more about her legal liability than the couple's moral standing. \n\nEmotionally, the couple is under a lot of stress. They didn't expect this and are struggling with the decision. While they might be seen as selfish, their concerns about being caregivers for life are real and valid. The key points are their preparedness and the potential impact on the child's well-being. \n\nConsidering all this, the couple's decision isn't clear-cut. They have valid reasons for feeling unprepared, and the surrogate's actions add another layer. However, deciding not to proceed could be seen as a rejection of a vulnerable child. But given the circumstances, it's a tough spot. Legally, they might have options, but ethically, it's complex. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the decision is based on the child's best interest or their own inability to cope. If they can't provide proper care, maybe they are in the right to consider this. However, if they're making a decision based on their own convenience, that's a problem. Given the information, they're in a difficult situation but not necessarily in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
