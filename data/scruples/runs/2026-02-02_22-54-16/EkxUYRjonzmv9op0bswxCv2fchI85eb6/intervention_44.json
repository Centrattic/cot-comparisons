It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering refusing the child conceived via surrogacy. The context is that the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida, and the surrogate has been using substances. The author and wife are struggling with whether to proceed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. The key points are the parents' right to make decisions about their child, the surrogate's actions, and the legal framework. Since surrogacy is altruistic and not for profit, maybe there's less financial pressure, but legally, the parents might have more say. However, the surrogate's drug use adds a layer where the parents might be concerned about the baby's health and their own preparedness.\n\nThe parents are worried about becoming full-time caregivers, which is a valid concern. They didn't plan for this and might not be ready. The surrogate's actions are problematic because she's harming the baby, but that's her own behavior. The parents might feel they can't proceed knowing the risks and the potential issues from the surrogate's habits.\n\nBut is it wrong to not want the child anymore? Ethically, people have the right to make difficult decisions about their family. However, the surrogate might be in a bind if the parents back out after she's pregnant. The question is whether they have the right to terminate the agreement or if there's a legal obligation. If they can't legally refuse, maybe they're stuck, but ethically, their decision is based on personal readiness and the baby's well-being.\n\nAnother angle: the parents were told early on the health risks. They might have felt they were prepared for challenges, but this is more than they anticipated. The surrogate's actions complicate things further. They might be conflicted between their initial commitment and the new realities.\n\nI think the answer hinges on personal choice and ethical responsibility. The parents aren't in the wrong because they're making a tough decision based on their circumstances, even if it's hard. The surrogate's actions are her own, but the parents can't be blamed for reassessing their situation. So, answer B.\n"
