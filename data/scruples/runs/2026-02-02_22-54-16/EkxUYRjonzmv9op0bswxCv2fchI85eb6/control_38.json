It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering refusing the baby due to Down Syndrome and spina bifida, and the surrogate's substance use. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple used a surrogate because the wife couldn't carry the pregnancy. The surrogate is now five months pregnant, and the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. Additionally, the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking, which could affect the baby's health.\n\nThe author is conflicted about whether they're wrong to not want the baby anymore. They mention the surrogate's actions as a factor, but also their own readiness to be caregivers for a child with significant needs. \n\nLegally, in some places, if surrogacy is altruistic, the couple might still have rights, but it's a gray area. Ethically, the couple's decision is complex. On one hand, they didn't know about the genetic risks and the surrogate's behavior. On the other hand, the child's well-being and the surrogate's responsibilities come into play.\n\nThe couple could be seen as not being in the wrong because they weren't aware of the risks beforehand. The surrogate's actions might have impacted the pregnancy, adding to the complications. However, considering the child's future and their own preparedness is also a valid concern. \n\nBut is it right to refuse the baby now? If they can abort, maybe they are within their rights. However, if the surrogacy agreement doesn't allow termination, it's complicated. The surrogate's actions might also affect her legal standing. \n\nThe key points are: the couple's lack of prior knowledge, the surrogate's undisclosed substance use, and their preparedness. The author might not be in the wrong because they're making a difficult decision based on new information. However, the way they frame it as the surrogate \"toying with a life\" might be harsh, as the surrogate was also unaware of her own substance use during pregnancy. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the couple is facing unexpected challenges and making a tough decision, not out of malice but based on their capacity to care. The surrogate's actions are a separate issue, but the couple's intent wasn't to harm.\n"
