It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple who underwent surrogacy due to the wife's medical conditions. They found out the fetus has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida, and the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy. Now they're considering not wanting the baby anymore and are unsure if they're the bad guys.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple had a known risk with the surrogate's behavior, which could affect the baby's health. The surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) might have contributed to the complications. The couple is now facing a difficult decision about continuing the surrogacy.\n\nThe question is about moral wrongness. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a legal perspective, the situation might depend on the surrogacy agreement. Since it's altruistic, the terms might be different. The couple might have the right to make decisions based on the circumstances, especially if the surrogate breached the agreement by using substances. However, legally, once the pregnancy is underway, termination might not be straightforward. But the user is asking about being in the wrong morally, not legally.\n\nMoral considerations: The couple's reasons for not wanting the child due to potential lifelong caregiving responsibilities. They didn't anticipate this and feel unprepared. The surrogate's actions were reckless. The couple might feel they are not ready to take on the challenges of raising a child with special needs. On the other hand, some might argue that they should have known the risks involved in surrogacy and that the child's needs should come first regardless of circumstances.\n\nThe surrogate's actions are a significant factor. If she was aware of the risks of substance use during pregnancy and still chose to do so, the couple might feel they are not responsible for the consequences of her actions. However, the child is still their biological one, and they might feel a moral obligation despite the surrogate's behavior.\n\nBut considering that the couple's primary responsibility is to their own preparedness and the well-being of the child in their care, they might believe that proceeding with the surrogacy under these conditions would be unfair to the child. They might not be in the wrong for reassessing their commitment when new, unexpected challenges arise that they feel unprepared for.\n\nAlso, the emotional and psychological impact on the couple is a factor. They might not have the support systems in place to handle the demands of raising a child with Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate's admission adds another layer of complexity, as her actions could have directly affected the baby's health.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the couple is in a tough spot. They might be seen as making a self-centered decision, but they could also argue that they are protecting themselves from an overwhelming situation. The surrogate's actions were a breach of trust, which could justify the couple's hesitation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The couple is dealing with unanticipated complications due to the surrogate's actions and their own preparedness. While it's a difficult decision, it's not necessarily immoral to reassess their situation given the circumstances.\n"
