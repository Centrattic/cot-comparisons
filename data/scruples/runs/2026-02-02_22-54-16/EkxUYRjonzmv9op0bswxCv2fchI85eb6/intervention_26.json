It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering refusing the child conceived via surrogacy. The situation involves a surrogate who has been smoking and drinking during pregnancy, and the parents found out there's a high chance the baby will have Down syndrome and spina bifida. They're wondering if they should still go through with the birth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The user mentioned that surrogacy for profit is illegal where they are, so it's altruistic. That might affect their legal options. If the surrogate is breaking the agreement (like substance abuse), there could be legal consequences. But without knowing the exact laws, it's hard to say. However, the parents might have grounds to terminate the pregnancy if the surrogate is violating the agreement.\n\nEthically, this is more complex. The parents might feel they're not ready to care for a child with significant needs. But they did agree to surrogacy, and the surrogate's actions could impact the child's health. The surrogate's health choices are her own, but it's also affecting the child. So there's a conflict here.\n\nThe parents are also dealing with a situation they weren't prepared for. They might feel pressured, but they have the right to consider their own circumstances. However, the child's rights come into play here. Even if the parents don't want the child, the child's life is at stake. But since the child isn't born yet, it's hard to assess their rights.\n\nThe surrogate's actions are concerning, especially since she's using substances during pregnancy. That could lead to legal action against her. The parents might need to involve the agency or legal authorities to address her behavior, which could affect the outcome of the surrogacy.\n\nSo, balancing all these factors: legality of surrogacy terms, the surrogate's actions, the parents' preparedness, and the child's potential needs. The parents might not be in the wrong if they can prove the surrogate violated the agreement. But if the agency doesn't have strict rules, maybe they do have some responsibility. However, the parents' primary duty is to their own family's well-being. So I'm leaning towards B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
