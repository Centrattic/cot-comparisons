It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple has been trying to have a child for years. The wife has PCOS and endometriosis, making it hard to carry a pregnancy. They went through a surrogacy agency, which is altruistic since it's illegal for profit in their country. The surrogate is now five months pregnant. The baby is biologically theirs. Then, during an amniocentesis, they found out the baby might have Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate also admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy, which is concerning.\n\nThe couple is now questioning whether they're the bad guys for not wanting to proceed with the pregnancy. They mention fear of being seen as insensitive, but they're not prepared to be caregivers for a child with such conditions. They also mention the surrogate \"toying with a life,\" which might refer to her substance use affecting the baby.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the couple's right to choose based on the baby's condition, the surrogate's actions, and ethical considerations around surrogacy agreements.\n\nFirst, in many places, surrogacy agreements can outline expectations, including prohibitions on substance use. If the surrogate violated the terms by smoking and drinking, that could be a breach of contract. The couple might have legal grounds to reconsider the arrangement, depending on the specific laws and the terms of their agreement.\n\nThen there's the ethical aspect. The couple is worried about being called insensitive for considering termination due to the baby's potential disabilities. This is a complex area. In some ethical frameworks, the right to make reproductive choices is considered important, and parents should not be blamed for seeking an abortion in such circumstances. However, others argue that life is valuable regardless of abilities, and parents should accept the child as it is.\n\nThe surrogate's actions complicate things. If she was aware of the need to avoid substances and violated that, it's a serious issue. But if she was under stress and not properly supported, maybe the agency or the couple could have done more to provide mental health resources. The fact that the surrogacy is altruistic might mean that financial incentives aren't there, which could affect the surrogate's stress levels and support.\n\nAnother angle is the legal and emotional consequences for the surrogate. If the couple decides not to proceed, what happens to her? She might have to carry the pregnancy to term alone, which could be traumatic. The couple might be in a tough spot legally and morally here. They have to consider her well-being too, not just their own.\n\nThe couple's statement about not being ready to be caregivers is a personal choice. While some might judge them, others understand that parenting a child with disabilities requires significant resources and emotional readiness. They might not be the right parents for this child, but that doesn't necessarily make them wrong for realizing that now.\n\nHowever, there's a risk that this decision could be seen as valuing certain lives over others. It's a slippery slope argument, but it's a real ethical concern. People with disabilities often face societal discrimination, and choosing not to have a child with them could be part of a larger problem.\n\nPutting it all together: The couple is in a tough situation. They might have valid reasons based on the surrogate's actions and their own readiness. But the ethical implications are complex. Legally, if the surrogate violated the agreement, the couple might have grounds to terminate the arrangement. However, emotionally and ethically, it's a gray area. Whether they're in the wrong depends on the specific circumstances of the surrogacy agreement, local laws, and one's perspective on reproductive rights versus disability rights.\n"
