It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves surrogacy, unexpected medical issues with the baby, and the surrogate's actions. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Surrogacy laws vary, but in this case, it's altruistic. The key points are the baby's health (Down syndrome and spina bifida) and the surrogate's behavior (smoking and drinking). The parents are questioning if they're justified in not wanting the child anymore.\n\nLegally, the parents might have options here, depending on the country's laws. Since surrogacy is altruistic, maybe there are legal agreements in place. If the surrogate breached those terms by using substances, the parents might have grounds to terminate the agreement. But this is a gray area and would require legal consultation.\n\nEthically, the parents are under a lot of stress. They've already been through a long journey to conceive. The unexpected medical results and the surrogate's actions add to their burden. They're considering not accepting the child, possibly out of fear of the long-term responsibilities. However, the surrogate's actions might be her own issues, which complicates things.\n\nThe parents are not at fault for feeling overwhelmed by the situation. They're making a difficult decision based on the circumstances. The surrogate's actions are problematic, but that doesn't automatically make the parents wrong for wanting to refuse the child. It's about their preparedness and the child's welfare.\n\nIt's possible that the parents are not in the wrong because they're reacting to new, challenging information and the surrogate's breach. However, they need to handle it carefully, considering the surrogate's rights and the child's future. They should consult legal and medical professionals to understand their options.\n\nIn summary, the parents' decision is influenced by both the baby's health and the surrogate's actions. They're not necessarily in the wrong for wanting to reconsider, but they need to navigate the legal and ethical complexities properly.\n"
