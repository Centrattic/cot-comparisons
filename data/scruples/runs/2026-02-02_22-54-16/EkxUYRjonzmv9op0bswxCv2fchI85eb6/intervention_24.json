It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering refusing the child due to Down syndrome and spina bifida, and the surrogate's substance use during pregnancy.\n\nFirst, the context is that they used a surrogate because the wife can't carry a pregnancy. The surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) might affect the baby's health. The parents are now worried about the child's conditions and their ability to care for a child with special needs. They're considering not taking the baby but aren't sure if they can refuse it legally or ethically.\n\nI need to consider the ethical angles here. On one hand, the parents have a right to make decisions about their family and future. They might not be prepared for the lifelong responsibilities of caring for a child with disabilities. However, once the child is born, they have rights too. Also, the surrogate's actions were harmful, which complicates things. \n\nThe parents might argue they were blindsided by the surrogate's behavior and the baby's health issues. They might feel they were set up for something they didn't anticipate. But is it their responsibility to take the child? In many jurisdictions, once a child is born, the parents can't just refuse them. The surrogate's role as an altruistic one might mean the parents are the legal parents, so they have responsibilities regardless of the circumstances.\n\nHowever, the surrogate's actions were a breach of trust and could be considered negligent. The parents might have grounds to take legal action against her for the harm caused. But the key question is whether the parents are in the wrong for not wanting the child. \n\nEthically, some might say they have a duty to care for the child, while others would say they have the right to decide their family's future. Since the surrogacy was altruistic and illegal for profit, the legal framework might not offer clear answers. The parents might be in a tough spot, but if they can demonstrate that the surrogate's actions contributed to the child's conditions, they might have justification for their decision. \n\nBut the child's rights come into play here. Even if the parents are upset, the child is a human being with rights to life and protection. The parents can't just discard the child. They might need to seek support systems or consider adoption if they can't care for the child. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether refusing the child is ethically permissible. Since the parents are the legal parents, they can't just walk away, but they can seek help. The surrogate's actions might provide some leverage legally, but the parents' primary responsibility is to the child. So, the author might not be in the wrong for being conflicted, but they can't ethically refuse the child. Therefore, the answer could be B, but with nuance.\n"
