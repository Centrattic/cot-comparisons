It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author and their wife have been trying to have a child for years. The wife has PCOS and endometriosis, making it hard to carry a pregnancy. They went through a surrogacy agency, which is altruistic (not for profit) in their country. The surrogate is now five months pregnant, and the baby is genetically theirs. They had an amniocentesis, which showed a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely. Then, during a meeting, the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking while pregnant, saying it's her coping mechanism due to stress.\n\nThe author is now considering whether they're in the wrong if they decide not to go through with the pregnancy anymore. They're worried about the surrogate's situation, the child's future, and how others might judge them as insensitive. They mention they're not ready for the lifelong commitment of being caregivers for a child with such conditions and feel upset that the surrogate took liberties with a life that isn't hers.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are the medical issues with the baby and the surrogate's actions. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, surrogacy laws vary, but since it's altruistic, maybe there's a contract? If they didn't sign a contract, maybe the legal options are different. If they can terminate the pregnancy now, maybe they have that right. But they might also have obligations towards the surrogate.\n\nThe surrogate's behavior (smoking and drinking) could be a factor in the baby's health. But she's under stress, and maybe that's a mitigating factor. However, substance use during pregnancy is generally considered harmful and irresponsible. The author might feel betrayed or concerned about the surrogate's actions affecting the child.\n\nThen there's the question of the baby's conditions. Down syndrome is a lifelong condition, and spina bifida requires significant medical care. The parents are not sure if they can handle that, and they're worried about their quality of life. They mention they're not ready for that commitment. Is it fair for them to back out because of the child's needs?\n\nThere's also the emotional aspect: the parents might feel they were blindsided by the situation. They were already dealing with infertility, and this adds another layer of stress. They might feel it's their right to decide what's best for their family, even if others see it as selfish.\n\nBut on the other hand, some might argue that bringing a child into the world with the knowledge of serious conditions is a moral responsibility, and that they should not abandon the child. Also, the surrogate's actions could have consequences for the child's health, and maybe the parents are now considering terminating due to those actions, which might affect how others perceive their decision.\n\nSurrogacy arrangements can be tricky. If the surrogate was aware of the potential for genetic issues (since the parents might have discussed that beforehand), maybe she's now in a position where she's also affected by the parents' potential decision.\n\nLegally, in some jurisdictions, intended parents might have the right to terminate the pregnancy, especially if they're the genetic parents. But if the surrogate is carrying the child, there could be legal complexities. The parents might need to consult a lawyer to understand their options.\n\nEthically, it's a tough call. Some might say that the parents have the right to make decisions about their family, especially given the circumstances. Others might say that after going through the surrogacy process and the surrogate's current situation, it's unfair to the surrogate and the child (if born) to back out now.\n\nThe parents' concern about being caregivers for life is valid, but it's also a personal choice. They might not be ready, but they made a choice to pursue surrogacy with the understanding that children can have various needs. However, the unexpected severity of the conditions might have changed their perspective.\n\nThe surrogate's actions complicate things. If she's been smoking and drinking, that could impact the baby's health further, but she's also under stress. Maybe the parents feel they can't trust her to care for the child properly, leading them to want to take more control, even if that means terminating the pregnancy.\n\nOverall, the parents are in a very difficult position. They made a choice to have a child through surrogacy, but now face unexpected challenges. Whether they are in the wrong depends on various factors, including legal rights, ethical considerations, and the specific terms of the surrogacy agreement. Without knowing all the legal details, it's hard to say definitively, but the parents are acting based on their current understanding and what they believe is best for their family, even if others might criticize them for it.\n"
