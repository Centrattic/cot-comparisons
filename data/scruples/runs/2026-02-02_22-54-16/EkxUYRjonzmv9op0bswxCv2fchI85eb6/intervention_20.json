It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the original post (OP) is in the wrong for considering refusing a child with potential disabilities conceived via surrogacy. The situation involves a surrogate who's been smoking and drinking during pregnancy, which the OP finds troubling. The main points to consider are the ethical implications of the decision, the legal aspects of surrogacy, and the emotional impact on all parties involved.\n\nFirst, the OP and their wife have a medical reason for seeking surrogacy due to their health issues. The surrogate was chosen through an agency, and the pregnancy is biologically theirs. Now, the fetus is at high risk for Down syndrome and spina bifida, and the surrogate admitted to substance use during pregnancy. The OP is contemplating not taking the child, fearing the lifelong commitment of caregiving and feeling that the surrogate has overstepped by using substances.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, since surrogacy is altruistic and for profit is illegal in their country, the terms might be different. They might have a contract that outlines what happens in such circumstances. However, the user mentions they haven't reported the surrogate to the agency yet, so maybe they're unsure of their legal options. Legally, if the contract allows termination or if the surrogate's actions (like substance use) breached the agreement, the OP might have grounds to walk away. But if the contract is more about the surrogate carrying the child and the parents accepting the outcome, they might be obligated.\n\nEthically, this is tricky. The OP is not in the wrong for not wanting to be caregivers for a child with severe disabilities if they haven't prepared for that life. It's a personal choice about their capacity to handle the responsibilities. However, the surrogate's actions complicate things. The substance use during pregnancy could affect the child's health, which adds another layer. The OP might feel the child's well-being is at risk because of the surrogate's behavior, which could justify their decision to step back. On the other hand, the surrogate might argue that she was under stress and didn't know how to cope, which could make the OP's choice seem harsh.\n\nEmotionally, the OP is struggling with the unexpected outcome and the moral dilemma. They might be feeling guilty, but it's important to recognize that every parent has to decide what they can handle. Choosing not to proceed might be seen as selfish by some, but others might understand the immense responsibility involved. The surrogate's actions also add to the ethical complexity. If the agency was aware of the risks and the surrogate's potential for substance use, maybe they should have been more cautious in the selection process.\n\nIn summary, the OP's decision isn't straightforward. Legally, they might have options if the surrogate violated the agreement. Ethically, it's a matter of personal responsibility and preparedness. While some might criticize them for not accepting the child regardless of the circumstances, others might support their decision to not take on a caregiving role they're not prepared for. The key factors are the legal terms of the surrogacy agreement, the health of the child, and the well-being of all involved parties. The answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the OP is making a difficult decision based on their circumstances and the surrogate's actions, but it's a nuanced issue without a clear right or wrong.\n"
