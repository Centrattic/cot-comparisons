It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering refusing their unborn child with Down syndrome and spina bifida, especially after the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple went through surrogacy because of medical issues. The surrogate is altruistic, not for profit. The baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate confessed to using harmful substances during pregnancy. The couple is now considering not taking the child.\n\nThe main ethical issues here are the couple's right to make decisions about their child's health, the surrogate's actions, and the legal and ethical implications of surrogacy. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, once a pregnancy is underway, the intended parents might not have the option to terminate it, especially if the surrogate is carrying the child. The surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) could be a factor in the child's health, which might affect the couple's decision. However, the couple's reasons for not wanting the child are personal and might involve their readiness to care for a child with special needs.\n\nLegally, surrogacy agreements vary. If it's altruistic, there might be more flexibility, but if the surrogate is breaking the agreement by using harmful substances, the couple might have legal grounds to take action. However, ending a pregnancy is a major decision, and laws around termination for surrogacy might be strict.\n\nEthically, the couple's feelings are valid; they might feel unprepared for the lifelong care required. But the surrogate's actions complicate things. The couple might feel they were set up for a situation they didn't anticipate, which could influence their decision. However, they also have to consider the life of the unborn child and the surrogate's well-being if they proceed.\n\nThe question is whether the couple is in the wrong. If they decide to proceed with the pregnancy despite the risks, they might be acting in the child's best interest. If they choose to terminate, they might be seen as abandoning the child, but the surrogate's actions could be a mitigating factor. The key points are the couple's right to decide, the surrogate's responsibility, and the child's rights.\n\nIn many cases, people have the right to make difficult decisions based on their circumstances. The couple's decision isn't necessarily malicious; they're expressing concern about their ability to care for a child with special needs. The surrogate's actions might be a contributing factor, but it's not clear if that's a valid reason to refuse the child. However, the couple's primary motivation seems to be their unpreparedness, which is a personal choice but might be seen as selfish by some.\n\nOn the other hand, the surrogate's behavior was harmful and could affect the child's health, which might give the couple grounds to reconsider. But legally and ethically, they might still have obligations. The answer depends on whether their decision is based on the surrogate's actions or their own unpreparedness. If it's the latter, they might be in the wrong. If it's due to the surrogate's negligence, it's more complex.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer isn't black and white. However, the primary reason given is their unpreparedness, which is a personal choice, so they could be seen as in the wrong. But if the surrogate's actions are the main reason, it's more justified. The question is whether they are in the wrong based on the scenario described. The user's main point is the couple not wanting the child due to the child's potential disabilities, so they might be in the wrong. However, the surrogate's actions complicate things. I think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because they are considering their own limitations and the surrogate's behavior, but it's a tough call. However, the initial decision to refuse based on the child's condition might be seen as ethically questionable unless there's a valid reason like the surrogate's misconduct.\n"
