It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the scenario is about a couple who went through surrogacy because the wife has medical issues that make it hard to carry a child. The surrogate now reveals she's been smoking and drinking during pregnancy, and the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The couple is considering not taking the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The user mentioned that surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's altruistic. In many countries, the legal framework for surrogacy can vary. If it's altruistic, maybe there are different obligations. But if the surrogate is breaking the agreed terms by using substances, that might affect things. Also, in some places, the intended parents might have the right to terminate the pregnancy if certain conditions are met, especially if the surrogate is acting in a way that endangers the child.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The couple is worried about the baby's health and their readiness to care for a child with disabilities. They might feel they aren't prepared for the long-term care, which is a personal decision. But does that make them wrong? People have different capacities and values. On the other hand, the surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) are harmful and potentially unethical. She's taking the child's life into her own hands, which could be seen as irresponsible.\n\nAnother angle is the surrogate's well-being. She's under stress and using substances as a coping mechanism. This raises questions about her mental health support and whether the agency provided enough support. If the surrogate wasn't given proper care, maybe the agency is at fault. But the couple is still responsible for the child's future. \n\nThe couple's decision to not take the baby could be seen as abandoning the child, but if they can't provide the necessary care, maybe it's better for the child if they don't take it. However, the baby would then need to be placed elsewhere, which might be difficult given the circumstances. \n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility: they are not in the wrong if they choose not to go through with the birth, especially since the surrogate breached her agreement by using substances. Their concerns about being caregivers for a child with significant needs are valid. The main issue is whether they have legal options to terminate the pregnancy or if they must proceed. Also, considering the surrogate's actions, the couple might have grounds to reevaluate the situation. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author's decision might not be wrong given the surrogate's actions and their own preparedness. But it's a complex situation with legal and ethical nuances. The answer would be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong considering the circumstances.\n"
