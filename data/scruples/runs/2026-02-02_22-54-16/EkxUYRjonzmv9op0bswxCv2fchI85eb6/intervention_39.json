It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for considering to refuse their unborn child with disabilities. The context is a surrogacy arrangement in a country where it's altruistic, not for profit. The surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy, which could affect the baby's health. The couple is now worried about the significant life changes required if the baby has Down Syndrome or Spina Bifida.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects. In altruistic surrogacy, the surrogate isn't paid, but there might still be legal agreements in place. The couple might have the right to make decisions about continuing the pregnancy, depending on local laws. But the surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) could complicate things. If she violated the terms of the surrogacy agreement regarding substance use, the couple might have legal recourse. However, the surrogate also seems to be struggling with stress, which adds a layer of vulnerability.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, it's a tough call. The couple is upfront about being unprepared for the challenges of raising a child with special needs. They're not denying the surrogate's right to her own choices, but the surrogate's actions may have impacted the child's health. The question is whether the couple's decision to not proceed is compassionate or selfish. On one hand, they might be prioritizing their ability to provide proper care. On the other, the surrogate might have been expected to uphold certain health standards.\n\nThe key points are the legality of the surrogacy, the terms of the agreement (if any), and the couple's capacity to handle the situation. If the surrogacy contract allows them to terminate based on health issues, they might not be in the wrong. But if the contract is binding, their refusal could backfire. The surrogate's health issues might also be a point of responsibility\u2014perhaps the couple should address her well-being first before making a decision about the child.\n\nI think the answer hinges on the specific legal framework and the couple's intentions. They are not the biological parents, but the surrogate's actions could have endangered the pregnancy. The couple's right to make decisions about the child's future is important, but they should also consider supporting the surrogate in her struggles instead of just walking away. However, the initial question is whether they're in the wrong. I'm leaning towards B, not in the wrong, but with the caveat that they should handle it responsibly, maybe by addressing the surrogate's health and consulting legal/agency channels. The main issue is the couple's right to refuse based on personal readiness versus the surrogate's actions. Since the surrogacy is altruistic, the couple might have more leeway in decision-making if the terms permit. So, the answer is B.\n"
