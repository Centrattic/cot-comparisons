It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a surrogacy arrangement where the surrogate has been drinking and smoking during pregnancy, and the results of the amniocentesis show the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The couple is considering refusing the baby now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In the country mentioned, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's altruistic. That probably means the surrogate isn't getting paid, which might affect her motivations. She's broken the agreement by using substances, which could be a breach of contract. The couple might have grounds to terminate the surrogacy because of her actions, especially if the substances affected the baby's health or posed a risk.\n\nThen there's the medical aspect. The couple wasn't prepared for the possibility of a child with significant disabilities. They might feel they wouldn't be able to provide the necessary care, which is understandable. However, making a decision based on the baby's potential disabilities is ethically complex. Some might argue it's selfish, while others might see it as a realistic assessment of their ability to care for the child.\n\nThe surrogate's actions (drugs and alcohol) are concerning. She's admitted to it, and that could impact the baby's development further. The couple might feel they can't trust the surrogate's care, especially if she's not following medical advice. This could be a reason to terminate the pregnancy legally, depending on the jurisdiction's laws regarding surrogacy agreements and breach of terms.\n\nEmotionally, the couple is struggling with the decision. They mention being upset that the surrogate \"toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them,\" which suggests they feel violated in some way. However, the surrogate's actions were her own, and she might have her own reasons for using substances, like stress. The couple's responsibility here is to handle the situation through the appropriate legal channels rather than making a decision solely based on the baby's potential disabilities.\n\nLegally, the couple might need to report the surrogate's behavior to authorities or the agency. If the surrogacy agreement allows for termination in cases of breach, they might have options. However, if it's illegal to terminate the pregnancy, they might have to proceed with the birth, but then they could choose not to take the child, which could lead to legal battles. The child's welfare is also a factor here\u2014being born into a difficult situation might not be in the child's best interest.\n\nEthically, deciding based on disabilities is a contentious issue. Some argue that all lives have value regardless of abilities, while others believe that parents should be honest about their ability to care for the child. The couple's decision not to proceed could be seen as abandoning responsibility, but it's also a personal choice based on their capacity and preparedness.\n\nIn summary, the couple is in a tough spot. The surrogate's actions may give them legal grounds to reconsider, and their emotional readiness is a valid concern. However, their decision could be seen as ethically questionable if they're rejecting the child solely due to disabilities. The answer might hinge on legal rights and the specific terms of the surrogacy agreement.\n"
