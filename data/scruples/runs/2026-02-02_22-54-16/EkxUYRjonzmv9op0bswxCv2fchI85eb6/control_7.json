It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves surrogacy, a pregnancy resulting in potential disabilities, and the surrogate's substance use.\n\nFirst, the couple went through a lot to have a child via surrogacy because of medical issues. The surrogate is altruistic, so not for profit. The baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida, which the couple wasn't thrilled about. Then the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking, which could affect the baby.\n\nThe couple is considering not wanting the baby anymore. They're worried about being seen as insensitive, but they feel unprepared for the lifelong commitment of caring for a child with those conditions. They also mention the surrogate \"toying with a life that doesn't belong to them,\" which adds complexity.\n\nLegally, surrogacy laws vary, but since it's altruistic, maybe there are no financial ties. The couple might have the right to make decisions, but the surrogate's actions (substance use) could affect the child. The surrogate's breaking down might show she's under stress, which could be a factor in her behavior.\n\nEthically, this is tough. The couple's right to choose versus the surrogate's responsibilities. The surrogate's actions during pregnancy could be seen as negligent, possibly affecting the baby's health. But the couple is now reconsidering their commitment because of the disabilities, which some might view as a failure to accept the child's needs.\n\nBut the couple's stance is about being unprepared for the challenges of raising a child with disabilities. That's a personal decision, but it's also about the child's best interest. However, terminating the pregnancy now might not be possible. Also, the surrogate's actions might have contributed to the situation, but that doesn't necessarily absolve the couple of their responsibilities.\n\nSo, is the couple in the wrong? They made a choice to proceed with surrogacy, knowing the biological parents' issues. Now facing unexpected challenges, they're reevaluating. They have a right to their autonomy, but the child's rights and the surrogate's actions complicate things. The answer might hinge on whether their decision is seen as selfish or a realistic consideration of their capacity. Alternatively, they might be expected to commit despite the challenges.\n"
