It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a surrogacy arrangement where the surrogate has been smoking and drinking during pregnancy, and the baby has a high chance of Down Syndrome and Spina Bifida. The couple is considering not accepting the baby anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Surrogacy laws vary, but in this case, it's stated that surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's altruistic. Altruistic surrogacy might have different legal implications compared to commercial arrangements. The couple might have legal rights and responsibilities depending on the jurisdiction. They might be able to terminate the pregnancy if certain conditions are met, but that depends on the law. However, the main question is about being in the wrong ethically, not just legally.\n\nEthically, the couple's decision is complex. They were told the baby has a high chance of Down Syndrome and Spina Bifida, which they feel would drastically change their lives. They also discovered the surrogate was using substances during pregnancy, which could affect the baby's health further. The couple might feel they are not prepared for the challenges of raising a child with special needs, especially given the added complications from the surrogate's behavior.\n\nBut is that making them the \"assholes\"? On one hand, people have the right to make decisions about their family and future. On the other hand, the surrogate is carrying their child, and breaking the surrogacy agreement could have emotional and possibly legal consequences for her. The couple hasn't reported the surrogate's actions yet, which might be because they're uncertain about their next steps. However, the surrogate's actions do impact the child's health, so the couple might have a duty to address that.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The couple's right to make decisions about their family based on unforeseen circumstances, 2) The ethical implications of terminating the pregnancy given the existing conditions, and 3) The handling of the surrogate's actions.\n\nIn some ethical frameworks, the couple's decision could be seen as prioritizing their own well-being and ability to provide care, which is understandable. However, others might criticize them for not accepting the child regardless of the challenges. The surrogate's actions also complicate things\u2014she violated medical advice by using substances, which could have contributed to the baby's conditions. The couple might feel they are not responsible for her actions, but they still have to deal with the consequences.\n\nIt's also important to consider the surrogate's situation. If she's under stress and using substances as coping mechanisms, that's a serious issue. The couple might need to consider whether she's being supported adequately and what their responsibilities are. However, the primary question is about the couple's moral standing.\n\nIn many cases, the right to make reproductive decisions is seen as the parents', especially when it comes to their ability to care for the child. If they believe they can't provide the necessary care due to these conditions, some might argue they have a right to refuse the child. However, others might argue that every child deserves a chance, regardless of the challenges. The line between personal choice and ethical responsibility is blurry here.\n\nGiven that, the answer isn't straightforward. The couple's decision is influenced by both the surrogate's actions and the medical prognosis. They might not be in the wrong because they had to make a difficult choice based on new information. But they also have a responsibility to handle the situation with care, possibly involving the agency and legal counsel to ensure they're following the right procedures and minimizing harm to the surrogate.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong), but there are complexities. They need to act responsibly, but their decision is based on their circumstances and the new information they've received.\n"
