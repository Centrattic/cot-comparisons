It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a surrogacy where the surrogate has been smoking and drinking, and the parents-to-be found out the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. They're considering not taking the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal and ethical aspects. The surrogacy is altruistic and in a country where it's not for profit. The parents have a biological connection to the child. The surrogate disclosed her substance use, which is a serious issue because smoking and drinking during pregnancy can cause fetal harm. \n\nThe parents are now facing a dilemma: they didn't anticipate the disabilities and aren't ready for the long-term caregiving required. They feel the surrogate compromised the child's health. \n\nLegally, in many altruistic surrogacy arrangements, the intended parents have rights, especially if the surrogate's actions endangered the child. The parents might have the option to terminate the pregnancy or take other legal actions, depending on local laws. Ethically, it's complex. The parents have the right to make decisions about their future, especially regarding their child's well-being and their own capacity to care. However, the surrogate's actions were harmful, which could affect the child's health beyond the genetic issues.\n\nThe parents' decision to not proceed might be seen as prioritizing their own readiness and the child's potential quality of life. But they also need to consider the surrogate's well-being and any legal obligations. It's possible they aren't in the wrong because they're facing unforeseen circumstances and the surrogate's behavior added to the complications. However, some might argue that they should accept the child regardless, which is a moral stance. \n\nSince the parents are not at fault for the genetic conditions, which are beyond their control, and the surrogate's actions were a separate issue, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But the situation is nuanced. The key factors are the surrogate's substance use and the parents' preparedness, which are both significant.\n"
