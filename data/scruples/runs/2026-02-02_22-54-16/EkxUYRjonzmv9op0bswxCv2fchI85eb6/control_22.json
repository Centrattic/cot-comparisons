It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for considering refusing the baby conceived via surrogacy. \n\nFirst, the context: The couple has a hard time conceiving due to medical issues and uses a surrogate in a country where surrogacy is altruistic. Now, the surrogate is 5 months pregnant. The baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida, which the couple didn't expect. They found out the surrogate was smoking and drinking, which adds stress. They're conflicted about continuing the pregnancy and feel they might not be ready for the lifelong commitment of caring for a child with these conditions.\n\nSo, the ethical dilemma here is whether the couple is justified in not wanting the child after knowing the risks. Legally, surrogacy agreements might have terms about such scenarios. Also, the surrogate's behavior (substance use) could affect the decision. \n\nThe couple's main arguments: They didn't anticipate the child's needs, which they feel would fundamentally change their lives. They also mention the surrogate \"toying with a life that doesn't belong to them,\" which could imply they feel the surrogate was irresponsible. \n\nBut the surrogacy was supposed to be altruistic. The surrogate's actions (smoking, drinking) might have violated the agreement's expectations, even if not explicitly stated. The couple might have grounds to reconsider if the surrogate breached the agreement. However, the baby is biologically theirs, so they have a responsibility towards the child. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the couple's feelings about being unprepared is understandable. However, deciding not to parent a child with disabilities because of personal readiness could be seen as selfish. On the other hand, if the surrogate's actions contributed to the baby's conditions, maybe they have a right to reconsider. But the couple can't control the surrogate's actions post-conception; they can only address the situation now.\n\nAlso, the legal aspect is important. If the surrogacy contract allows termination or has clauses about health issues, that would influence the answer. Since the user mentions they haven't reported it yet, maybe they're unsure about legal options. Without legal clarity, it's hard to say if they're in the wrong.\n\nThe surrogate's health risks: smoking and drinking during pregnancy are harmful, but she might have been under stress. The couple might feel the surrogate wasn't responsible, but they had to rely on her. However, they can't control her actions once the pregnancy is underway. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the couple can't walk away from their own biological child, regardless of disabilities. But if the surrogate's actions contributed to the situation, maybe they can argue that she's at fault. However, this is a complex mix of factors.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether their decision is seen as abandonment or a reasonable response to circumstances. If they had no prior knowledge of the surrogate's habits and the health issues are a new development, it's hard to blame them. But walking away from a child due to unforeseen challenges might be seen as not fully committing as parents. \n\nConsidering all angles, the answer isn't straightforward. Legally, they might have options, but morally, it's a tough call. Since the user wants a yes or no, but the situation is nuanced, I have to consider the main factors. The couple is in a difficult position, but refusing the child could be seen as not taking full responsibility. However, the surrogate's actions also play a role. The correct answer might be B (no, they are not in the wrong) because they are dealing with unexpected challenges and the surrogate's breach might affect their decision, but this is a tough judgment.\n"
