It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The scenario is about a couple who used a surrogate to have a child. The surrogate is now pregnant, but there are complications with the baby's health, like Down syndrome and spina bifida. Plus, the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy. The couple is considering not taking the baby and are asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects of surrogacy. Since surrogacy is altruistic and not for profit, the legal framework might differ. The surrogate isn't being paid, so maybe there are different responsibilities on both sides. The couple's main concern is the health of the baby and their readiness to care for a child with disabilities. They also mention the surrogate's actions affecting the pregnancy.\n\nLegally, I'm not sure about the specifics. If the surrogacy agreement is in place, there might be clauses about termination or what happens if the child has disabilities. But since they haven't reported the surrogate's substance use yet, maybe there's a process to follow. Ethically, the couple is weighing their right to make decisions based on the baby's health against the surrogate's actions. The surrogate's behavior could impact the child's well-being, so maybe the couple is justified in considering termination for the baby's future.\n\nThe couple's feelings of being overwhelmed and unprepared are valid. Caring for a child with disabilities is a significant commitment, and if they're not ready, it's a personal choice. However, they might also consider the surrogate's situation. She's under stress and used coping mechanisms, which is troubling. But her actions could have consequences for the child. \n\nThe question is whether they're in the wrong for not wanting the baby. If they decide to terminate, they might face ethical criticism for not being prepared or for making a decision based on the child's disabilities. On the other hand, if they proceed, they might be taking on a role they're not ready for, which isn't fair to the child. The surrogate's actions complicate things further. They could be at fault for endangering the pregnancy, but the couple's decision might be influenced by her behavior.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the child's rights. Choosing not to have a child with disabilities could be seen as discriminatory, but the couple's inability to provide the necessary care is a real concern. It's a tough balance. Legally, if the surrogacy agreement allows for termination, they might be within their rights. If not, they might need to navigate legal processes.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer isn't straightforward. However, the couple's decision is based on their inability to care for a child with disabilities and the surrogate's actions, which might not be entirely their fault. So, depending on the legal context and the surrogacy agreement, they might not be in the wrong. But ethically, there's a debate about discarding the child due to disabilities. However, considering their personal preparedness and the surrogate's breach of responsibilities, the answer could be B (not in the wrong).\n"
