It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves surrogacy, unexpected health issues in the fetus, and the surrogate's behavior during pregnancy.\n\nFirst, the surrogacy was altruistic, so there's no financial incentive. The couple went through a lot to get here, and the surrogate is now pregnant. The amniocentesis results show high chances of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The couple is now considering not proceeding with the pregnancy, partly because the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking, which adds stress and potential health risks.\n\nThe author feels conflicted. They acknowledge the surrogate's actions but are concerned about their ability to handle the child's needs. The key points here are the ethical responsibilities of the couple, the legal implications of surrogacy in their jurisdiction, and the well-being of the child and surrogate.\n\nLegally, in altruistic surrogacy, the legal parentage is usually determined early. The couple might be the legal parents, so terminating the pregnancy might involve legal steps. However, the surrogate's actions complicate things. They broke the terms of the agreement by using substances, which could affect the child's health. The couple has a right to consider the child's best interest and their own capacity to parent.\n\nEthically, the couple's decision is based on their readiness to care for a child with disabilities. It's a tough call, but they are honest about their limitations. The surrogate's behavior is a breach, and the couple is in a difficult position to address this. They may not be in the wrong for reevaluating, especially if they can't meet the child's needs. However, they have a responsibility to handle this situation carefully, perhaps consulting with the agency and considering the surrogate's well-being as well.\n\nThe main question is whether their decision to not proceed is morally wrong. Since they were unaware of the challenges, and the surrogate's actions added stress, their decision might be seen as self-aware and responsible. But it's a close call. Given the circumstances, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong), as they are making a difficult choice based on their capacity and the child's future.\n"
