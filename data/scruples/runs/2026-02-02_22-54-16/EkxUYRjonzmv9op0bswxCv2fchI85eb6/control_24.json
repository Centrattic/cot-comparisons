It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple who used a surrogate because the wife can't carry a pregnancy. The surrogate is now pregnant, and they found out the baby might have Down syndrome and spina bifida. Then the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy. The couple is considering not wanting the baby anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal and ethical aspects. The article mentions it's altruistic surrogacy since it's illegal for profit. So maybe the legal terms here are different from commercial surrogacy. In some places, the intended parents might have more rights, but others might require carrying through. But since the surrogate is breaking the agreement by using substances, maybe that's a problem.\n\nThe couple's main issue is the health of the baby. They didn't expect this and feel unprepared for the lifelong care. The surrogate's actions might have contributed to the baby's conditions. But how much responsibility does the surrogate have here? If she was supposed to take care of the baby but did something harmful, maybe the couple has grounds to reconsider.\n\nEthically, the couple might feel they're not at fault because the surrogate's actions were harmful. On the other hand, they are making a decision based on the baby's health, which some might see as selfish. But considering the surrogate's actions, maybe they are not the ones in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the question is about whether refusing the baby is wrong. If the surrogacy agreement didn't account for this scenario, maybe the couple has options. If the surrogate breached the agreement by using substances, the couple might have legal recourse. However, the emotional and ethical side is tricky. They might be seen as abandoning the child because of disabilities, which some would criticize. But the surrogate's negligence complicates things.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the couple's decision is justified given the surrogate's actions. If the surrogate violated the terms, the couple might be within their rights to back out, even if the decision is difficult. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. But I need to check if the act of refusing the child is inherently wrong, regardless of the circumstances. However, since the surrogate's behavior was problematic, the couple's stance could be seen as protecting the child's best interests if the surrogate can't be trusted. So the answer might be B.\n"
