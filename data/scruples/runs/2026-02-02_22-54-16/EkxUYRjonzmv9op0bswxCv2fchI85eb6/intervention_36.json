It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering refusing the unborn child conceived via surrogacy. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple went through surrogacy because the wife couldn't carry a pregnancy. The surrogate is now five months pregnant, and the baby is biologically theirs. They had an amniocentesis that showed a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. Then the surrogate admitted to drinking and smoking while pregnant, which adds another layer of concern.\n\nThe authors are conflicted. They mention not being ready for the lifelong commitment of caring for a child with such conditions. They're also upset that the surrogate \"toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them,\" implying they feel the surrogate was irresponsible.\n\nNow, the question is whether they're in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, this is tricky. On one hand, they're making a tough decision based on their own readiness and the child's future. On the other hand, the surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) might have contributed to the child's health issues, which complicates things.\n\nLegally, surrogacy agreements vary, but since it's altruistic and not for profit, the legal framework might not have clear provisions for terminating the pregnancy in such a scenario. However, the couple's right to make decisions about their biological child could be a factor. They might have the legal standing to choose, especially if the surrogate's actions were negligent.\n\nEthically, people have different views. Some might argue that the couple is in the right because they weren't prepared for the challenges of raising a child with special needs, and the surrogate's actions were harmful. Others might say they should have considered the possibility of birth defects beforehand and that choosing to terminate now is abandoning the child.\n\nThe surrogate's behavior (using substances during pregnancy) could be seen as a breach of trust. If the surrogacy agreement didn't allow for such behaviors, the couple might have grounds to reconsider. However, the surrogate's emotional state (stress) might also be a mitigating factor.\n\nIn the end, it's a complex situation. The authors are facing a life-changing decision that they didn't anticipate, and they're considering the child's well-being as well as their own capacity to care for it. While some might judge their decision, others might understand the difficulty. The key factors are the legal rights regarding surrogacy, the surrogate's actions, and the couple's genuine concerns about their preparedness.\n"
