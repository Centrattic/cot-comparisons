It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering refusing their unborn child due to Down syndrome and spina bifida, especially after the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from different angles. The parents have a medical condition that makes it hard for the wife to carry a pregnancy, so they used a surrogate. The surrogate was supposed to be altruistic, but she's been using harmful substances. The parents are now dealing with the possibility of the baby having serious disabilities and are considering not taking the child.\n\nOn one hand, the parents have a right to their own expectations and preparedness for parenthood. If they aren't ready for a child with significant needs, maybe it's better not to proceed. But on the other hand, once the child is born, they have ethical and legal responsibilities. Also, the surrogate's actions (drugs and alcohol) might be a factor in the baby's condition, which complicates things.\n\nLegally, if they can terminate the pregnancy, maybe they can. But if the child is born, they can't just refuse it. They might have to go through legal processes like termination of parental rights or adoption. However, the ethical part is tricky. Are they being selfish? Some might argue that every child deserves a chance, while others might respect the parents' right to choose their family's circumstances.\n\nThe surrogate's behavior is a red flag. If she violated the agreement by using substances, maybe they can hold her accountable. But the parents' main issue is the child's condition. It's possible they are in a moral dilemma here. They might be prioritizing their own ability to cope over the child's life, which some might see as wrong, but others might understand their reasoning.\n\nI need to consider cultural and personal beliefs. Some people believe life is sacred and should be protected regardless of conditions, while others prioritize the quality of life. The parents also have to consider the surrogate's well-being if she's being honest about her stress. Was she properly supported? Did the agency fail her?\n\nIn terms of legal steps, they should consult the agency and maybe a lawyer. The answer isn't black and white. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If they proceed to terminate, some might say it's wrong. If they don't and can't care for the child, that's also problematic. The surrogate's actions might mitigate some of the parents' responsibility, but not entirely. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because they're making a difficult decision based on their circumstances and the surrogate's actions. But there's a strong argument for A as well. However, since the question is about the author's wrongness, and given the context of their medical issues and the surrogate's behavior, it's a complex situation where they're not necessarily in the wrong.\n"
