It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. First, I need to understand the situation. The couple went through surrogacy because the wife can't carry a pregnancy. The surrogate is now pregnant, and the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. Plus, the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking. The couple is considering not taking the baby and is unsure if they can legally refuse it.\n\nSo, the main points are: the couple didn't expect the baby's health issues, the surrogate broke the agreement by using harmful substances, and they're now thinking of not accepting the child. The question is whether they're the wrongdoers here.\n\nI need to consider the legal aspects first. If surrogacy is altruistic and not for profit, there might be legal contracts. If the surrogate violated the contract by using alcohol and tobacco, the couple might have grounds to terminate the agreement. Legally, if the surrogate breached her part, the couple might not be obligated to accept the baby. That could protect them from being in the wrong.\n\nThen, the ethical angle. The couple's decision is based on their readiness to care for a child with disabilities. They might feel unprepared, which is a personal choice. But is it ethical to abandon the child because they don't want to care for it? It's a tough call. On one hand, they didn't anticipate the challenges; on the other, the child's well-being is a concern. However, the surrogate's actions (smoking/drinking) add another layer. Her behavior contributed to the risks, so maybe the couple is justified in reconsidering.\n\nAlso, the surrogate's responsibility. She was supposed to follow medical guidelines, and her actions could have affected the baby's health. If she's breached the terms, the couple's decision isn't just about the baby's condition but also about her negligence. This could shift the blame more towards the surrogate.\n\nBut the couple's initial hesitation about Down syndrome and spina bifida might be seen as not wanting to care for a child with disabilities. That could be viewed as selfish or discriminatory, but it's also about their ability to handle the long-term responsibilities. They might feel they can't provide adequate care, which is a valid personal limitation.\n\nIn terms of the child's future, if they can't accept the baby, maybe there's an option to place it for adoption. But since surrogacy agreements might not allow that, they need to check the legal terms. If they can't legally refuse, they might have to take responsibility, but given the surrogate's actions, there might be a way out.\n\nPutting it all together, the couple isn't necessarily in the wrong. The surrogate's actions are a significant factor, and the couple's decision could be a response to both the baby's condition and the surrogate's breach of duty. They're dealing with unexpected challenges and personal readiness. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), as their situation involves both legal grounds and the surrogate's misconduct.\n"
