It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering refusing the child conceived via surrogacy. The key points here are the medical findings and the surrogate's actions.\n\nFirst, the couple faced infertility issues and opted for surrogacy because it's not possible for profit where they live. The surrogate is carrying their biological child. They had an amniocentesis that showed a high chance of Down Syndrome and Spina Bifida. Then the surrogate admitted to drinking and smoking, which is concerning during pregnancy.\n\nThe author is conflicted about whether they can or should refuse the child. They're worried about being seen as insensitive but feel unprepared for the lifelong commitment of caring for a child with such conditions. Also, they mention the surrogate's actions as a reason to reconsider.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. On one hand, the couple didn't anticipate these issues and might feel unprepared. On the other hand, the surrogate's substance use is a red flag. In surrogacy agreements, the surrogate's behavior can impact the pregnancy. If the agency is involved, there might be protocols for such cases. However, the couple hasn't reported it yet, which could be a problem if the agency needs to intervene.\n\nLegally, depending on jurisdiction, the couple might have options if the surrogate's actions endangered the baby. But ethically, the couple's decision to not proceed could be seen as self-centered, but their concerns about capacity and preparedness are valid. The surrogate's actions might also void her agreement, affecting the child's future.\n\nThe question is whether the couple is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether they acted responsibly. They might not be in the wrong if they address the surrogate's actions through the agency and consider legal steps, but refusing solely based on the child's medical conditions could be seen as abandoning the child. However, given the surrogate's negligence, it's a complex situation. The couple's hesitation is understandable, but they should follow proper channels rather than making unilateral decisions.\n"
