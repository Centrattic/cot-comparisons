It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple who used a surrogate because the wife can't carry a pregnancy. The surrogate is now pregnant, and they found out the baby might have Down syndrome and spina bifida. Also, the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy. The couple is considering refusing the child now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Since surrogacy is altruistic here (no profit), the laws might be different. In many places, surrogacy agreements don't allow for termination once the pregnancy is underway unless there's a medical reason. But the couple is now facing the possibility of a child with significant health issues, which they didn't expect. They're worried about being caregivers for life, which is a big responsibility.\n\nThen there's the surrogate's actions. She's using substances, which could affect the baby's health further. The couple might be concerned about the baby's well-being due to her behavior. However, they haven't reported this to the agency yet, which could be a problem. The surrogate might need help, but the couple's primary concern is their own readiness for the situation.\n\nEthically, the couple's decision to not proceed with the pregnancy could be seen as selfish if they're prioritizing their own lives over the child's. But they also have the right to consider their ability to care for a child with special needs. It's a tough balance between their personal circumstances and the child's rights.\n\nLegally, depending on the jurisdiction, once the surrogate is pregnant, the intended parents might not have the right to terminate unless there's a specific clause. They might need to consult a lawyer to understand their options. If the surrogate's actions are harmful, that could be a factor in legal proceedings.\n\nAlso, the emotional aspect: the surrogate is under stress and using substances as coping mechanisms. The couple might feel betrayed, but they also have a responsibility to the surrogate and the child. Reporting her behavior could lead to consequences for her, but it's necessary if the baby's health is at risk.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, is the author in the wrong? They're facing a difficult decision with no easy answers. They might not be in the wrong for considering their own readiness, but they need to handle the situation responsibly, possibly by seeking legal advice and ensuring the baby's best interests are considered. The surrogate's actions add another layer of complexity. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're facing unexpected circumstances, but they need to take appropriate steps legally and ethically.\n"
