It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The scenario involves surrogacy and a difficult decision after finding out the baby might have Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate also admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy, which adds another layer.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether the decision to not want the baby now is justified. Surrogacy arrangements can vary, but since it's altruistic and not for profit, there might be different legal and ethical considerations. The couple had the intention to have a biological child, but the medical results changed their perspective. They mention not wanting to be caregivers for a child with significant needs, which is a personal choice but might be seen as selfish by some.\n\nThe surrogate's actions of smoking and drinking could be seen as a breach of the agreement, especially if the surrogacy contract had certain health requirements. However, the couple didn't report it yet, maybe because they're still processing the information. The ethical dilemma here is balancing the couple's right to make decisions about their family with the surrogate's actions and the child's well-being.\n\nLegally, depending on the jurisdiction, the couple might have options to terminate the surrogacy agreement if the surrogate violated terms. Ethically, it's more complex. The couple's decision could be viewed as prioritizing their own life circumstances over the child's existence, which might be controversial. However, they might also be considering the quality of life for the child and their inability to provide the necessary care.\n\nThe surrogate could face consequences if she breached the agreement, but she's also human and had her own stressors. The couple's hesitation to report the surrogate might stem from uncertainty about legal steps and fear of judgment.\n\nIn terms of morality, some might argue that life is precious and the couple is making a selfish choice. Others might empathize with their situation, acknowledging the challenges of raising a child with disabilities. The surrogate's behavior complicates things further, as she may have impacted the pregnancy.\n\nOverall, it's a tough situation. The couple's decision isn't necessarily right or wrong in a black-and-white sense. They have valid reasons based on their preparedness and the surrogate's actions, but there's also a responsibility to consider the child's rights and the surrogate's accountability. The answer likely leans towards not being in the wrong (B) because they're making a personal decision based on their circumstances and the surrogate's actions, but it's a nuanced case.\n"
