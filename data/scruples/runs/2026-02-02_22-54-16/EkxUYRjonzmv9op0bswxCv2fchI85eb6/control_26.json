It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves surrogacy and a decision about continuing the pregnancy after finding out the baby might have Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate also admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The couple is considering refusing the child, which is a big decision. They have a right to make decisions about their family, but there's also the surrogate's actions to consider. She was supposed to be an altruistic surrogate, but she's been using substances, which could affect the baby's health. That's a problem because the child's well-being is at risk.\n\nThe couple's fear of becoming caregivers for a child with significant needs is valid. They might not be prepared for the lifelong commitment. But does that make them wrong? It depends on the legal and ethical framework. In altruistic surrogacy, the parents might still have the right to make decisions, but if the surrogate's actions endangered the child, maybe the couple has a right to reconsider.\n\nAlso, reporting the surrogate's behavior is important for the child's health. The couple is hesitant to report because they're unsure of their options. But not reporting could be neglecting the child's welfare if the surrogate's actions have caused harm.\n\nThe question is whether the couple is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, in altruistic surrogacy, the intended parents are the legal parents once the child is born. So they might have the right to make decisions. However, the surrogate's actions could lead to legal issues if the child is harmed. The couple's decision to not take the child might be legally possible, but ethically, it's complex. They might be seen as abandoning the child, but the surrogate's responsibility here is also a factor.\n\nConsidering all this, the couple isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're dealing with unexpected challenges and the surrogate's negligence. They're making a tough decision based on their circumstances. The answer might be B (No), but I need to check if there's any ethical obligation they're ignoring. They do have a responsibility to the child, but the surrogate's actions complicate things. The couple's decision is difficult but not clearly wrong.\n"
