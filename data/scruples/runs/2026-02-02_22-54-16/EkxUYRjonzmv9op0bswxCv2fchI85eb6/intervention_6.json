It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering refusing their unborn child conceived via surrogacy. The situation involves a surrogate who admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy, and the couple found out the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. They\u2019re conflicted about continuing the pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. The user mentioned that surrogacy for profit is illegal here, so it's altruistic. The surrogate is breaking the agreement by smoking and drinking, which could be a legal issue. The couple might have grounds to terminate the surrogacy if there's a breach of contract. Legally, that might not be the case, so the author might be in the right there.\n\nEthically, it's a tougher call. The couple is facing a significant life change if the child has these conditions. They might feel unprepared to be caregivers for a lifetime. On the other hand, the surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) could impact the baby's health further, which adds another layer of complexity. The couple's decision isn't just about the child's condition but also the surrogate's negligence.\n\nPublic opinion might split here. Some might say the couple is being selfish for not wanting to raise a child with disabilities, others might support their decision given the unforeseen circumstances and the surrogate's actions. The author's feelings of being upset that the surrogate \"toyed with a life\" that isn't theirs might be valid if the surrogate violated the terms of the agreement.\n\nThe key points are: the couple's readiness for a caregiving role, the surrogate's breach of trust, and the legal implications of terminating the surrogacy. Since the surrogate broke the agreement, the couple might have a legal basis to proceed. Emotionally, the couple is struggling with guilt and societal judgment, but their decision isn't necessarily wrong if they acted within legal boundaries and considered the surrogate's negligence.\n\nConsidering all factors, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're dealing with unexpected issues and the surrogate violated the agreement, making their decision ethically and potentially legally justified.\n"
