It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. They've gone through surrogacy because the wife has medical issues. The surrogate is now pregnant, and the amniocentesis shows a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. Then the surrogate admits to smoking and drinking during pregnancy, which adds another layer of complications.\n\nFirst, the ethical angle: the couple is considering refusing the baby. They mention that having a child with those conditions would drastically change their lives, and they feel unprepared for that. On one hand, they might feel like they're being responsible by considering the child's future and their ability to care for it. On the other hand, someone might argue that they made a commitment when agreeing to surrogacy, and now they're backtracking based on the child's condition.\n\nThen there's the surrogate's actions. She's admitted to drinking and smoking, which could affect the baby's health. The couple is upset not just about the medical conditions but also about the surrogate \"toying with a life that doesn't belong to them.\" That's a strong statement. They might feel betrayed or that the surrogate didn't take her responsibilities seriously. But does that give them the right to abandon the baby?\n\nLegally, the situation is tricky. They mentioned surrogacy is altruistic, so there might not be a contract that allows termination based on the parents' wishes. The surrogate is carrying the child, and if they can't terminate the pregnancy, they might have to go through with the birth. The question is whether they can refuse to take the child after birth. Legally, in many jurisdictions, once the child is born, the intended parents usually have parental rights unless there are legal reasons to deny them, but this is a gray area, especially with the surrogate's actions.\n\nEmotionally, the couple is struggling. They might feel that the surrogate's behavior has compromised the baby's health, adding to their decision to not proceed. But is it their responsibility to care for the child even if the surrogate made poor choices? The child isn't at fault for its condition or the surrogate's actions, so some might argue the couple has a moral obligation to care for it.\n\nAnother angle: the couple's honesty. They admit they didn't want to take on the responsibility of a child with disabilities. Is it wrong to prioritize their own readiness and lifestyle? Some people believe that parents have a duty to care for children regardless of challenges, while others think it's reasonable to consider their capacity to provide adequate care.\n\nThe surrogate's well-being is also a factor. If the couple refuses the child, what happens to the surrogate? She might be left with a child she can't care for, leading to potential legal battles or the child being placed in foster care. The couple might be worried about the surrogate's situation, but they might also feel that she's not a suitable caregiver given her actions.\n\nIn terms of ethical judgment, it's a tough call. The couple's reasons are based on their inability to care for a child with disabilities and the surrogate's actions. But their decision could be seen as abandoning the child, which is ethically problematic. However, they might argue they're acting in the child's best interest if they can't provide the necessary support, but others might say that the child should still have a home.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's position is in a very difficult situation. Whether they're in the wrong depends on societal values and legal standards. If the law requires them to take the child regardless of circumstances, they might be in the wrong. If not, they might be making a hard decision based on their own capabilities. However, from a moral standpoint, some might say that once committed to surrogacy, they have a responsibility regardless of the child's condition.\n"
