It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves surrogacy and a decision not to accept the baby due to Down syndrome and spina bifida, and the surrogate was smoking and drinking during pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal context. The user mentioned that surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. In many jurisdictions, especially where surrogacy is altruistic, the intended parents still have legal rights, but the surrogate's actions might affect the legal standing. If the surrogate was smoking and drinking, that's a red flag. Those are harmful substances during pregnancy, and the surrogate might be violating the agreed terms of the surrogacy arrangement, which often includes abstaining from such substances to protect the child's health.\n\nThe intended parents are now facing a situation where the baby has significant health issues they weren't prepared for. They're considering not accepting the child. The question is whether they're in the wrong for doing so. From a legal standpoint, if the surrogate's actions contributed to the baby's conditions, the intended parents might have grounds to reconsider. However, terminating the pregnancy at five months might be too late, depending on local laws. In some places, you can't terminate after a certain point unless there's a medical emergency, which the parents might not be considering.\n\nEthically, it's a tough spot. Down syndrome and spina bifida are significant but manageable conditions. The parents might be feeling unprepared, but declining the child after a surrogacy could be seen as abandoning the commitment. However, the surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) might have compromised the pregnancy, which could shift some responsibility. The parents were told it's very likely the baby has these conditions, which is a lot to process. \n\nBut the key points here are: the parents were informed of the surrogate's behavior that could affect the baby's health, and they're now reevaluating their commitment. The surrogate's actions may have breached the agreement, making the parents reconsider. However, the parents are also facing the reality of caring for a child with these conditions, which they didn't anticipate. \n\nI think the parents aren't in the wrong because the surrogate's behavior was a violation that could have impacted the pregnancy, and the parents were not made aware of this before the risk of these conditions. Also, they are trying to handle the situation by seeking options through the agency. The emotional and practical challenges they're facing are valid, especially if they weren't prepared for the caregiving aspect. So the answer would be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
