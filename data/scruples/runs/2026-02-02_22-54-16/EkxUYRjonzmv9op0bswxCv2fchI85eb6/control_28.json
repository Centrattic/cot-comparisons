It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple using a surrogacy arrangement, and they found out the surrogate has been smoking and drinking during pregnancy. The baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida, and the couple is considering refusing the child. The answer options are A (yes, they're wrong) or B (no, they're not).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal and ethical aspects here. The user mentioned that surrogacy for profit is illegal in their country, so it's altruistic. In such cases, the surrogate might not have a financial incentive but is still legally bound to the agreement. However, the surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) could be considered a breach of the surrogate's responsibilities. Typically, surrogacy agreements outline expectations for the surrogate's health behaviors during pregnancy. If she violated those terms, the intended parents might have legal recourse, depending on local laws.\n\nEthically, the couple's stance revolves around being unprepared for the challenges of raising a child with disabilities. They express concern that their lives would fundamentally change into caregivers. However, the primary issue here is the surrogate's conduct. Her actions could pose risks to the child's health, which might justify reconsidering the situation. The couple's decision isn't just about the child's condition but also about the surrogate's non-compliance with the agreement.\n\nBut wait, the question is whether the couple is in the wrong. The main ethical consideration is their right to refuse the child. In altruistic surrogacy, the intended parents usually have the right to terminate the pregnancy if they choose, especially if there are legal terms in place. However, once the child is born, the legal and ethical implications shift. If they can't legally refuse the child post-birth, then they might have to go through the process of relinquishing the child, which could be more complicated and emotional.\n\nThe couple's feelings of being \"toys with a life\" are a bit harsh. The surrogate, while she made poor choices, is still carrying their biological child. The couple is in a position where they have to weigh the surrogate's actions against their own preparedness. The key is whether they followed the proper legal channels. Since they haven't reported it yet and are unsure of their options, maybe they should consult the agency and legal experts first.\n\nBut ethically, is it wrong for them to not want the baby? Some might argue that life is precious and they should accept the child regardless. Others might see the couple's right to make a choice based on their ability to provide care. However, the surrogate's behavior adds another layer. If she was aware of the risks and still chose to act recklessly, that's a different responsibility. The couple's reaction could be seen as a response to both the child's potential health issues and the surrogate's breach of the agreement.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, even in altruistic surrogacy, the intended parents have the right to decide the pregnancy's continuation. So if the agency has procedures for such cases, the couple might not be in the wrong. But if they proceed to abandon the child after birth, that could be problematic. The answer might hinge on the legal framework and whether they act within the agreed terms.\n\nI think the couple isn't in the wrong because they're reacting to a situation that wasn't anticipated and the surrogate's actions. However, their approach needs to be legal and considerate of the child's well-being. So the answer is B (No).\n"
