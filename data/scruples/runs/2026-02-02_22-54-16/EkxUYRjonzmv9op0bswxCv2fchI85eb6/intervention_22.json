It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering refusing the baby after finding out about Down syndrome and spina bifida, plus the surrogate's substance use. \n\nFirst, the situation: They went through a lot to have a child, using a surrogate since the wife can't carry a pregnancy. The surrogate is altruistic, which in some places means they can't profit, so maybe the legal terms are different. Now they found out the baby might have significant health issues, and the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy.\n\nThe author is questioning their decision not to go through with the pregnancy. The user thinks the author isn't wrong. Let me consider the ethics here. On one hand, the surrogate's actions (drugs and alcohol) could have affected the baby's development. But she was under stress and broke down, so maybe she's also a victim of circumstances. \n\nThe parents are worried about being caregivers for a child with disabilities. They might feel unprepared, which is a real concern. But is it ethical to terminate a pregnancy after it's well into the second trimester? Depending on the location, laws on termination might be strict. Also, the surrogate's well-being and the child's rights come into play here. \n\nIn altruistic surrogacy, the legal framework might allow the intended parents to make decisions about continuing the pregnancy, especially if the surrogate isn't a profit-driven entity. However, the parents' decision could be seen as abandoning the child once they know about the disabilities, which might be viewed as discriminatory. \n\nThe surrogate's actions (substance use) might have contributed to the baby's conditions, so they might share some responsibility. But the parents are now facing the reality of a child with needs they didn't plan for. \n\nIt's a complex situation. The parents' feelings of not being ready could be valid, but the ethical considerations of terminating a pregnancy at 5 months, especially in the context of surrogacy, add layers. Also, the surrogate's well-being and the potential legal consequences of not reporting her substance use need to be considered.\n\nIn the end, the decision hinges on the parents' right to choose versus the rights of the surrogate and the unborn child. If the legal system supports the parents' right to decide based on medical conditions, they might not be in the wrong. But if the surrogacy agreement requires them to accept the child regardless, then they might be breaching the contract. \n\nGiven the information, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They're facing a tough decision with valid concerns about their ability to care for a child with such needs, compounded by the surrogate's actions. However, the ethical debate is nuanced and depends on legal and personal values.\n"
