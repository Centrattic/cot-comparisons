It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for considering refusing their unborn child, which was conceived through surrogacy. The situation involves the surrogate admitting to smoking and drinking during pregnancy, and the parents finding out the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The parents are now unsure if they can handle the responsibilities and are considering not taking the child.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key elements here. The surrogate is in a surrogacy arrangement that's altruistic, meaning she's not being paid. The parents are faced with the possibility of their child having significant health issues. The surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) might have contributed to the baby's conditions, though that's not certain. The parents are struggling with whether they're justified in not wanting the child now.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know others' opinions. The answer should be A or B. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, this is tricky. On one hand, the parents have the right to make decisions about their family and future. They might feel unprepared for the care needs of a child with disabilities. On the other hand, the surrogacy agreement likely involved certain expectations. The surrogate's actions might have breached the terms of the surrogacy, especially if she knew about the risks of substance use during pregnancy. \n\nBut the parents' decision could be seen as abandoning the child because of its disabilities. Society often debates whether it's acceptable to choose not to parent a child with disabilities. Some might argue that the parents are being realistic about their capabilities, while others might see it as discriminatory or heartless.\n\nLegally, if surrogacy is altruistic, there might be legal protections for the parents to terminate the arrangement, especially if the surrogate violated agreed-upon conditions. However, the specifics depend on the laws of the country. The parents need to check their surrogacy contract and consult legal experts. \n\nThe surrogate's actions (substance use) may also have legal implications. If she was aware of the health risks and still engaged in those behaviors, it could affect her legal standing in the surrogacy agreement. \n\nThe parents are also dealing with the emotional and ethical dilemma of moving forward. They might feel guilty for not wanting the child, especially knowing the surrogate's stress. But their decision is based on their ability to care for the child and the long-term impact on their lives.\n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's subjective. If the parents followed the surrogacy agreement and acted within the law, they might not be wrong. However, if the agreement required them to accept the child regardless of health issues, then their refusal could be problematic. The surrogate's behavior complicates things\u2014she might have breached the agreement, which could support the parents' decision.\n\nThe parents are also dealing with the reality that surrogacy involves risks, and they may not be at fault for unforeseen circumstances. However, they need to consider the child's best interests and the surrogate's well-being if they proceed to terminate the surrogacy.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author's position isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have valid concerns about their readiness and the child's health, and the surrogate's actions might have contributed to the situation. The decision is complex, but the parents' primary responsibility is to ensure the child's well-being and their own ability to care for it. The answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong), but it's a nuanced situation with no clear right or wrong.\n"
