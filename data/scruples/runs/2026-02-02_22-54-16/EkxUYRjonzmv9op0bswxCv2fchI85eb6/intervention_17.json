It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple using a surrogate to have a child, but after finding out the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida, they're considering not taking the child. Plus, the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Surrogacy agreements can vary widely, but in many cases, especially altruistic ones, the intended parents usually have the right to make decisions regarding the pregnancy. The parents are dealing with a significant health issue in the fetus, which they didn't anticipate. They might feel unprepared for the lifelong commitment of caring for a child with special needs. That's a valid concern.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of the surrogate's actions. Smoking and drinking during pregnancy is harmful and irresponsible, which could affect the baby's health. The surrogate's behavior might have contributed to the complications. The intended parents are upset that the surrogate \"toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them,\" which adds another layer of ethical conflict. \n\nThe intended parents are struggling with the decision to continue the surrogacy. They fear being seen as insensitive, but their reasons are about their readiness and the potential impact on their lives. It's a tough spot to be in. \n\nLegally, the answer could depend on the surrogacy agreement. If the agreement allows for termination or refusal based on certain conditions, the parents might have that right. If not, they might be legally bound to take the child. But since the user is asking about being \"in the wrong\" ethically, not legally, that's a different angle. \n\nSome might argue that once a pregnancy is underway, the intended parents have a moral obligation to proceed, especially if the child is biologically theirs. Others might see their decision as understandable given the circumstances and the surrogate's negligence. The surrogate's actions could be seen as a factor in the parents' decision-making process. \n\nIt's also important to consider the best interests of the child. If the parents are not prepared to care for a child with disabilities, maybe the child would be better off with alternative arrangements. But that's a big assumption and involves complex ethical considerations.\n\nIn summary, the parents are in a very difficult situation. Their decision is influenced by the unexpected health issues of the fetus and the surrogate's irresponsible behavior. While some might criticize their decision as insensitive, others might empathize with their need to prepare for parenthood and protect their own well-being. So, based on the information given, I think the author is not in the wrong.\n"
