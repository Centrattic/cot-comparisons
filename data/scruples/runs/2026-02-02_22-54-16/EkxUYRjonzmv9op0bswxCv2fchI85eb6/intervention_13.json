It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a surrogacy arrangement where the surrogate has been smoking and drinking during pregnancy, and the child has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The couple is considering refusing the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects. Surrogacy laws vary, but in their case, it's altruistic and not for profit. The surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) could be a breach of the surrogacy agreement, especially if there were pre-agreed terms about substance use during pregnancy. That could be a legal point in their favor. The couple might have grounds to terminate the surrogacy if the surrogate violated the agreement.\n\nNext, the medical aspect. The couple didn't know about the risks beforehand. They were told the baby was biologically theirs, but the health issues were unexpected. Their decision to not proceed is based on the significant life changes required for a child with disabilities. While some might argue they should accept the child regardless, others might see it as a realistic consideration of their ability to care for the child long-term.\n\nEthically, there's a debate here. Some might say that life is sacred and they should not abandon the child. Others might argue that the couple has the right to make informed decisions about their future and that the surrogate's actions compromised the child's health. The couple's distress about the surrogate \"toying with a life\" could be a point about responsibility.\n\nAlso, the couple hasn't reported the surrogate yet, which suggests they're trying to handle it carefully. They might be seeking legal advice, and the answer should consider that they might have valid reasons to proceed with termination based on the surrogate's violations and new medical information.\n\nIn terms of options, in some jurisdictions, if the surrogate breaches the agreement, the intended parents can seek termination of the pregnancy. If the pregnancy continues, the parents might not be forced to accept the child if the surrogate's actions were a breach. However, this depends on local laws and the specific terms of the surrogacy contract.\n\nThe couple's feelings about being unprepared for the responsibilities of a child with disabilities are valid. They had a specific expectation when they started the surrogacy process. The unexpected complications could be a significant burden they weren't mentally or financially prepared for.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the couple's decision could be seen as justified if the surrogate violated the agreement and the medical risks were unforeseen. Therefore, the answer might be B, not in the wrong. However, there's a counter-argument that life should be protected regardless. But given the circumstances, especially the surrogate's actions and the lack of prior knowledge, the couple's position has merit.\n"
