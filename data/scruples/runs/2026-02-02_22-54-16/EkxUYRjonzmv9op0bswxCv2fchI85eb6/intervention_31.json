It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering refusing the baby they conceived via surrogacy. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple tried for a long time to have a child and used a surrogate because the wife had medical issues. Surrogacy is altruistic where they are. The surrogate is five months pregnant. The baby might have Down syndrome and spina bifida. They found out the surrogate was smoking and drinking, which adds stress. They're considering not taking the child and are unsure about their options.\n\nSo, the key points are: the unexpected medical conditions of the baby, the surrogate's substance use, and the couple's feelings about being caregivers for a child with significant needs. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not wanting to proceed.\n\nI should consider the ethical angles. On one hand, the couple had a right to know the risks, and the surrogate's actions might have impacted the baby's health. But the baby is biologically theirs, and they didn't anticipate these issues. They might feel unprepared for the lifelong commitment of caring for a child with disabilities. \n\nThen there's the surrogate's responsibility. She was supposed to be altruistic, but she broke the agreement by using substances. The couple might feel betrayed or that the surrogate didn't take proper care of the baby. \n\nLegally, in places where surrogacy is altruistic, there might be specific laws about termination or what happens if the surrogate can't care for the child. However, the couple hasn't consulted the agency yet, which is mentioned as a next step. \n\nEmotionally, they're struggling with the decision. They might fear being seen as insensitive, but they're also making a difficult choice based on their circumstances. \n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that they're being selfish by backing out after getting the child to term via a surrogate. The surrogate has invested time and effort, and the child's future could be affected by their decision. There's also the ethical consideration of the child's rights and whether they can be refused based on disabilities. \n\nBut the surrogate's actions complicate things. If she was negligent, maybe the couple isn't at fault for reconsidering. They might feel the surrogate didn't uphold her part of the agreement. \n\nI think there's no clear right or wrong answer, but based on the information, the couple might be justified in their decision given the surrogate's actions and the unexpected health issues. They're facing a situation they weren't prepared for, and the surrogate's behavior adds another layer. So, the answer might be B, that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
