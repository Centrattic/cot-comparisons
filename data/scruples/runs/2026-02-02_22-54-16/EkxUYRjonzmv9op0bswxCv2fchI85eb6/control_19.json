It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple using a surrogate, and the surrogate revealed she's been smoking and drinking during pregnancy. The couple is considering not wanting the baby now because of the potential disabilities like Down syndrome and spina bifida.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The surrogacy is altruistic, not for profit. The surrogate's actions (drugs and alcohol) might be a breach of the surrogacy agreement. The couple might have the right to terminate the pregnancy if the surrogate violated the terms. But they are also concerned about the child's health, which adds another layer.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the couple is facing a tough choice. They didn't anticipate the complications and are worried about the lifestyle change. The surrogate's actions could have harmed the fetus, which might be a point in the couple's favor. However, the decision to not want the child could be seen as abandoning the child, but they might have the legal right to terminate if the surrogate breached the contract.\n\nThe couple hasn't reported the surrogate yet, so they're still in a decision phase. The answer might depend on the specific terms of their surrogacy agreement. If the agreement allows termination if the surrogate violates certain conditions (like substance abuse), then the couple might be within their rights. If not, then they might be in a harder spot.\n\nAlso, the couple's feelings about the child's disabilities are complex. It's important to note that having a child with special needs is a major life change, and it's valid for them to feel unprepared. However, making the decision based on disabilities could be seen as discriminatory, but they might be considering the practical aspects of caring for such a child.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the key points are the surrogate's actions and the couple's response. The surrogate's substance abuse is a serious issue, and the couple might be justified in considering termination if it's allowed. However, they also need to consider the surrogate's well-being and the potential consequences for the child if they proceed but the child is born with issues.\n\nI think the answer leans towards the couple not being in the wrong, especially if the surrogate broke the agreement. But it's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid concerns. The key is whether the surrogate's actions give the couple the legal right to terminate, and whether their decision is based on valid reasons (surrogate's negligence) rather than just the child's disabilities.\n"
