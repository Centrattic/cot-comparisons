It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA question is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple using a surrogate due to medical issues. They found out the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida, and the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy. The couple is considering not taking the child and is unsure if they can back out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal and ethical aspects here. Surrogacy laws can vary, but the scenario mentions it's altruistic and for profit is illegal. So they're likely in a country where surrogacy is regulated, maybe the UK or Canada. In such places, surrogacy agreements might not be legally binding, but there are strict processes. If the surrogate is breaking the agreement by substance use, that could be a point for the couple to consider termination of the arrangement. However, the question is about whether the couple is in the wrong for possibly not wanting the child now.\n\nEthically, the couple's feelings about Down syndrome and spina bifida are important. They might feel unprepared for the lifelong care required. But Down syndrome is a part of life for many people, and the value of life shouldn't be discounted. The couple's hesitation might be seen as prejudicial based on the child's potential disabilities. However, they also have the right to make decisions about their family and future. The surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) could be considered a breach of the agreement, which might justify their decision to reconsider.\n\nThe couple hasn't reported the surrogate yet, so they're in a vulnerable position. They might be justified in seeking legal advice to determine their options. The surrogate's actions could lead to legal consequences, but the couple's decision to not take the child might depend on the terms of their surrogacy agreement and local laws.\n\nIn terms of being the \"assholes,\" the couple is facing unexpected challenges. They might be acting in their own interests and the surrogate's negligence contributed to the situation. However, deciding not to take the child could be seen as abandonment. On the other hand, if the surrogate's actions increased the risk of the child's conditions, perhaps the couple is reacting to circumstances beyond their control.\n\nI think the key factors are the couple's right to decide their family's future, the surrogate's breach of the agreement, and the legal framework. Ethically, it's complex, but legally, if the surrogate violated the terms, the couple might have grounds. However, the decision to not want the child despite the disabilities could be controversial. They might not be in the wrong legally but could face ethical criticism for prioritizing their own readiness over the child's life. Still, given the surrogate's misconduct and the unexpected medical issues, their position might be more defensible.\n"
