It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a planned surrogacy due to the wife's infertility, and now they're facing a situation where the fetus has potential disabilities and the surrogate has been using substances. The couple is considering not accepting the baby anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects. In many jurisdictions, surrogacy agreements, especially altruistic ones, are governed by specific laws. The user mentions that surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. Legally, the couple might have certain rights and obligations. However, once the pregnancy is underway, what options do they have? Some places allow termination, but that depends on local laws. Also, if the surrogate is breaching the agreement by substance use, that's a legal matter too.\n\nEthically, the couple's decision hinges on their preparedness for a child with significant needs. They mention Down syndrome and spina bifida, which require lifelong care. The couple feels unprepared for this, which is a personal decision. However, they also feel upset that the surrogate used substances, implying a breach of trust. \n\nThe surrogate's actions\u2014smoking and drinking\u2014are serious because they can harm the fetus. This could be a legal issue if the surrogacy contract prohibits such behavior. The couple might have grounds to seek termination if the contract allows it, but they need to check the legal framework.\n\nThe couple's emotional state is important. They're overwhelmed and not ready, which is understandable. The question is whether their decision not to proceed is morally wrong. Some might argue that life is precious and they should accept the child despite challenges. Others might say that the couple has the right to make decisions based on their circumstances, especially if they believe they can't provide adequate care.\n\nThe surrogate's well-being is another angle. If the couple terminates the pregnancy, what happens to her? She might face emotional and physical consequences. However, if she violated the agreement by using substances, the couple might feel justified in their decision.\n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, the key points are the legality of their options, the ethical implications of their decision, and the surrogate's actions. The answer depends on whether their decision is considered morally wrong. Since they are considering the impact on their lives and the surrogate's breach of the contract, some might see their decision as not in the wrong, especially if they had legal recourse.\n\nI need to check if there's any indication that the couple has a legal right to terminate the pregnancy given the surrogate's actions and the health risks. Also, whether their decision is based on the baby's disabilities or the surrogate's actions. The part about the disabilities might be seen as a different issue. While some might criticize them for not accepting a child with disabilities, others might empathize with their situation. However, the surrogate's substance use adds another layer, as it could be a breach of the agreement, making the couple's decision more defensible.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer hinges on legal rights and ethical perspectives. If legally they can terminate due to the surrogate's actions, they might not be in the wrong. If they proceed based on the child's disabilities alone, some might argue they are, but given the combined factors, the answer could be B (not in the wrong).\n"
