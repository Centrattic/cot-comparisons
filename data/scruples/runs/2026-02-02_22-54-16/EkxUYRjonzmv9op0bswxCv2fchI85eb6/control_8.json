It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple using a surrogate to have a child, and they found out the baby might have Down syndrome and spina bifida. Plus, the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy. Now they're considering not taking the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the ethical aspects here. Surrogacy agreements usually have legal terms. Since it's altruistic and not for profit, the laws might be different. The surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) could affect the baby's health, which adds another layer. The couple might feel they're not prepared for the challenges of raising a child with those conditions. But is it wrong to back out now?\n\nThe couple hasn't reported the surrogate yet. They're worried about being seen as insensitive. But they also have their own rights and responsibilities. The surrogate broke the agreement by using substances, which might give the couple grounds to terminate the arrangement. However, at 5 months, terminating a pregnancy is a big decision, and in some places, it might not be legally permissible later on.\n\nAlso, there's the question of the child's welfare. If the surrogate's actions contributed to the baby's conditions, the couple might feel they can't take responsibility. But they also have to consider the surrogate's well-being if they proceed with termination. What happens to the child if they don't take it? That's a concern too.\n\nLegally, the answer would depend on the jurisdiction's surrogacy laws. Ethically, it's more complex. People have different views on disability; some might argue the couple is being selfish, while others might see them as acting in their best interest. The fact that the surrogate breached her part of the agreement might tip the scales against the couple being in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the surrogate's misconduct, the unexpected health issues, the couple's right to make decisions about their family, and the legal framework, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no obvious ethical misstep here. They're not abandoning a child but considering their ability to care for it properly. The surrogate's actions complicate things, so the couple isn't entirely at fault.\n"
