It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong after deciding to refuse the baby due to Down syndrome and spina bifida, and the surrogate's substance use. \n\nFirst, the context: They used surrogacy because the wife couldn't carry the baby. The surrogate was supposed to be altruistic. Now, they found out the baby has a high chance of genetic conditions, and the surrogate admitted to drinking and smoking. They're considering not taking the baby.\n\nThe question is whether they're wrong for doing that. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider ethical perspectives. On one hand, the couple might feel unprepared for the lifelong demands of raising a child with disabilities. They might feel the surrogate's actions (substance use) risked the child's health. But on the other hand, they made an agreement with the surrogate, and walking away could leave the surrogate in a difficult position. Also, the couple's decision might be seen as prioritizing their own desires over the child's potential life.\n\nLaws about surrogacy vary, but in their case, it's altruistic, so legal terms might be different. If they terminate or refuse the child, what are the implications? The surrogate's rights and the child's rights come into play here. \n\nEthically, some might argue that they have the right to make such a decision, especially if they're not prepared for the responsibilities. Others might see it as abandoning a child in need. The surrogate's actions also add complexity\u2014did her behavior during pregnancy affect the outcome, and is that part of the couple's decision-making?\n\nThe couple is also considering the surrogate's behavior. If the surrogate was supposed to follow strict guidelines but didn't, maybe the couple has grounds to reconsider. However, the child is still their biological one. \n\nLegally, if they can't terminate the pregnancy now (since it's 5 months along), they might not have a choice but to proceed. If they reject the child post-birth, the surrogate might become the legal parent, unless there's a legal agreement. That could create a custody battle. \n\nIn terms of morality, it's tough. They might be seen as making a selfish choice, especially if the child could have a life with support. But they might also be realistic about their ability to provide care. The surrogate's actions might be a separate issue, but it's part of their frustration.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a complex situation. Depending on one's values, some might say they're not in the wrong because they're making a difficult decision based on their circumstances. Others might say they're abandoning a child, especially if the surrogate's actions were a surprise to them, and they should have been more careful in choosing a surrogate. \n\nBut the question is whether they're in the wrong. The answer could be B (No), as they're making a personal choice based on their readiness and unforeseen complications. However, there's a risk that their decision could be seen as unethical. The answer might depend on cultural or legal context, but given the information, B seems plausible.\n"
