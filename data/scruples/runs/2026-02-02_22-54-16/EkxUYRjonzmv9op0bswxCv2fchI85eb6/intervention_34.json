It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for considering refusing their unborn child, which was conceived via surrogacy. The key points here are the medical issues discovered (Down syndrome and spina bifida) and the surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking during pregnancy).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Since surrogacy is altruistic in their country, there might be less legal entanglement compared to commercial surrogacy. But laws vary, so without specific legal knowledge, it's hard to say. However, the user mentions they're not sure if they can refuse the baby, which suggests there might be legal steps involved.\n\nEthically, the parents are facing a situation where the child's quality of life and their ability to care for the child are in question. They mention not being ready to be caregivers for a lifetime, which is a significant consideration. However, others might argue that life is valuable regardless of challenges, and parents should commit to caring for their child regardless.\n\nThe surrogate's behavior complicates things. She's broken the trust by using harmful substances, which could affect the child. The parents might feel justified in reconsidering due to her actions, but there's also the responsibility to ensure the child's well-being, regardless of the surrogate's behavior.\n\nEmotionally, the parents are struggling with unexpected circumstances. They might feel overwhelmed and uncertain about their decision. Others might criticize them as selfish, but they could also be seen as making a difficult choice based on realistic expectations.\n\nI should weigh the parents' right to make decisions about their family against the child's right to life and care. If they proceed, they face a long-term commitment they're unprepared for. If they don't, they need to ensure the child is placed in a supportive environment. The surrogate's actions add another layer, but legally and ethically, the parents' decision might be influenced by her breach of trust.\n\nIn conclusion, while the decision is tough, the parents might not be in the wrong as they are making a choice based on their circumstances and the surrogate's actions. However, they should consider legal and ethical implications, possibly seeking legal advice and exploring options like adoption or foster care if they decide not to proceed.\n"
