It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author here is in the wrong. So the situation is about a couple using a surrogate, and now they found out the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. Plus, the surrogate was smoking and drinking during the pregnancy. They're considering not wanting the baby anymore and are unsure if they're the bad guys here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The story is set in a place where surrogacy is purely altruistic, not for profit. So the legal framework might be different. The couple's main issue is that they didn't expect the baby to have those conditions and are now considering not going through with the birth. But they also mention the surrogate's actions, which could have affected the baby's health.\n\nNow, the author is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting the baby. Let's break it down. On one hand, the couple might be worried about the life changes and being caregivers. They may feel unprepared. On the other hand, the surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) could have contributed to or exacerbated the issues with the fetus. \n\nBut is it ethical to terminate a pregnancy based on the child's potential disabilities? That's a big question. Some people argue that all children, regardless of disabilities, deserve a chance, and parents should commit to caring for them. Others might say that parents have the right to make such decisions, especially if they're unprepared. However, the surrogate's actions complicate things. If her behavior contributed to the health issues, that might affect the couple's responsibility.\n\nAlso, the couple hasn't reported the surrogate's actions to the agency yet, so they might be trying to handle this discreetly. Are they considering legal options, like terminating the surrogacy agreement? Depending on the laws in their country, they might have options, but since surrogacy is altruistic, the legal recourse might be limited. \n\nThe author's concern is about being insensitive, but they also feel the surrogate was irresponsible. The question is whether their decision to not proceed is justifiable. If the surrogate broke the terms by smoking and drinking, the couple might argue that the surrogate failed in her responsibilities, which could affect the surrogacy agreement. \n\nHowever, the couple's original intent was to have a child, and they might be making a decision based on the child's future. But is it fair to walk away from a child just because of potential disabilities? That's a moral dilemma. The author might not be in the wrong if they can show that the surrogate's actions breached the agreement, but if they're solely deciding based on the disabilities, that's a more contentious issue. \n\nIn some cases, people might view the couple as being in the wrong for prioritizing their own readiness over the child's life. But others might see it as a realistic assessment of their ability to care for a child with special needs. The surrogate's actions add another layer, possibly shifting some blame to her for the situation. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer depends on whether the couple is acting based on the surrogate's breach of the agreement or on their own inability to cope with a child with disabilities. If they can legally terminate the surrogacy due to the surrogate's actions, they might not be in the wrong. But if they're choosing to not accept the child solely because of the disabilities, that could be seen as wrong. However, since the surrogate's actions are part of the equation, it's a complex scenario where the couple isn't entirely to blame. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong, making the answer B.\n"
