It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves surrogacy, and the parents now want to refuse the baby due to medical issues found in the amniocentesis. The surrogate has also been smoking and drinking during pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal and ethical aspects here. The surrogacy is altruistic, not for profit, which might affect the legal implications. In many places, especially where surrogacy is altruistic, the legal rights and responsibilities are different from commercial surrogacy. The parents might have agreed on terms before the pregnancy, but if there were no specific clauses about terminating the pregnancy if certain conditions are found, that could complicate things.\n\nThe parents are facing a difficult decision. They were told the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. They feel unprepared for the lifelong commitment of caring for a child with these conditions. Ethically, is it wrong for them to not want to proceed? People have the right to their autonomy and to make decisions about their future, including family planning. However, the surrogate's actions (using substances) might affect the baby's health further, but the parents are now considering not taking the child.\n\nThe parents are also concerned about the surrogate's behavior. If the surrogate was unfaithful to the agreed-upon care for the pregnancy, that could be a point in the parents' favor. But the surrogate was under stress, which might mitigate some blame. However, the parents are now questioning whether they can refuse the baby. Legally, depending on the jurisdiction, the parents might have options if the surrogate is in violation of their agreement. They might need to involve the agency or the court to terminate the pregnancy or transfer care.\n\nEthically, the parents are conflicted. They might feel that they are being insensitive by not wanting the child, but they also didn't plan for this scenario. They are considering the long-term impact of raising a child with significant medical needs. It's a tough balance between their rights and the child's rights. But since the child hasn't been born yet, the parents' decision might be seen as a choice about their future, which is personal but also has societal implications.\n\nIn terms of the surrogate, she might be in a vulnerable position, especially if she's under stress. However, her actions (substance use) could affect the baby's health, which adds another layer. The parents might have a legal case if the surrogate violated the terms, but that's speculative.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Are the parents in the wrong? It's a complex situation. Legally, if they can prove the surrogate breached the agreement, they might have grounds. Ethically, it's about their right to choose versus the child's potential right to life. Different people might view this differently. Some might side with the parents, considering their right to make decisions about their family, while others might argue that they have a responsibility once the child is born. Since the answer is binary (A or B), and given the context, it's more likely that the answer is B\u2014no, the author is not in the wrong. They are making a difficult decision based on their circumstances, and unless there's a legal obligation they ignored, their choice isn't inherently wrong.\n"
