It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a surrogacy arrangement where the surrogate has been using substances during pregnancy, leading the intended parents to consider refusing the child. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Surrogacy arrangements, especially altruistic ones, have specific legal frameworks. In many places, the intended parents have certain rights and responsibilities once the pregnancy is underway. If the surrogate violated the agreed-upon terms by using drugs and alcohol, which could harm the fetus, there might be legal recourse. However, the specifics depend on local laws, which the user hasn't mentioned.\n\nEthically, the intended parents are faced with a difficult decision. They didn't anticipate the health issues and now feel unprepared to care for a child with significant needs. The surrogate's actions might have compromised the child's health, which adds complexity. The parents feel they were set up for a situation they didn't consent to, especially regarding the health risks that have emerged. \n\nOn the other hand, the surrogate might have been under stress and made poor choices, possibly without adequate support. The parents could be seen as abandoning the child, but they also have their own limitations and the right to consider their readiness for parenthood. \n\nThe key points are: the parents' right to make decisions about their child's future, the surrogate's breach of the agreement, and the child's best interests. If the parents can legally and ethically terminate the pregnancy due to the surrogate's actions and the child's health issues, they might not be in the wrong. However, if the decision is based solely on the child's disabilities, that could be seen as discriminatory. \n\nSince the parents are considering refusal due to both the surrogate's negligence and the health concerns, the ethical stance might lean towards them not being in the wrong, as they are reacting to circumstances beyond their control and the surrogate's actions. The answer would be B (No), but I need to verify if the refusal is justified given the surrogate's actions and the child's potential needs.\n"
