It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a surrogacy arrangement where the surrogate was supposed to carry a child for the couple, but she's been smoking and drinking during the pregnancy. The baby might have Down syndrome and spina bifida, and the couple is now considering refusing the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The user mentioned that surrogacy for profit is illegal in their country, so it's altruistic. That might affect their rights. If the surrogate is breaking the agreement by using substances, that could be a breach. But I'm not sure about the specifics of surrogacy laws there. Maybe the couple has legal recourse if the surrogate violated the terms.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The couple is worried about being caregivers for a child with disabilities, which is a big life change. They might feel unprepared. However, some might argue that choosing a child based on potential disabilities is unethical. But others might say it's their right to make decisions about their future based on their readiness.\n\nThe surrogate's actions\u2014smoking and drinking\u2014are concerning. Those are harmful to the fetus, but she was stressed. It's a difficult situation for her too. However, she agreed to the surrogacy, so her actions might have breached the agreement. The couple might have grounds to terminate the arrangement if the surrogate violated terms.\n\nThe couple hasn't reported her yet, which could be because they're unsure of the process. But they need to consider the health of the baby. Also, the surrogate's mental health is part of the story; she's under stress and using substances as a coping mechanism. That adds complexity.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might see the couple as selfish for not wanting the child despite the disabilities. Others might empathize with their fear of becoming lifelong caregivers. It's a tough call. The couple's main concern is their ability to care for the child, but they also have a responsibility to ensure the child's well-being.\n\nLegally, if the surrogate's actions violated the surrogacy agreement, the couple might have options. But if the agreement is altruistic and not legally binding in a way that allows termination, they might not be able to refuse the child. This could leave them in a difficult position.\n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" if the couple is making a decision based on their own readiness and the surrogate's actions, they might not be entirely to blame. However, if the surrogacy agreement doesn't allow for termination based on these factors, they might still be obligated to proceed. The surrogate's behavior is problematic, but that doesn't necessarily exonerate the couple from all responsibility.\n\nOverall, the situation is complex with both legal and ethical considerations. The answer hinges on the specifics of the surrogacy laws in their country and the terms of the agreement. Since the user is in an altruistic surrogacy setup where the surrogate isn't being paid, there might be less legal obligation for her to adhere strictly, but there's still an ethical expectation. The couple's decision to refuse the child could be seen as self-centered, but they're also facing a significant life change they weren't prepared for. I think they're not in the wrong because they're dealing with unanticipated circumstances and a breach of the surrogacy terms by the surrogate.\n"
