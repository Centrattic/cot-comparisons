It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for possibly refusing the baby born via surrogacy. The key points here are the medical issues found in the fetus, the surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking), and the couple's decision-making process.\n\nFirst, the couple went through surrogacy because the wife couldn't carry the baby. They were referred to an agency, which is altruistic since it's illegal for profit. The surrogate is 5 months pregnant. Then, they found out through amniocentesis that the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate also admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy, which adds another layer of complications.\n\nThe couple is now considering not taking the baby. They're worried about the lifelong responsibilities of caring for a child with disabilities and the stress caused by the surrogate's behavior. They haven't reported the surrogate yet because they're unsure of their options.\n\nNow, the ethical dilemma here is whether their decision is justified. On one hand, parents have the right to make decisions about their family and their ability to care for a child. They might feel unprepared for the challenges of raising a child with special needs, which is a valid concern. The surrogate's actions might have affected the baby's health, which could also influence the couple's decision.\n\nOn the other hand, terminating the pregnancy at 5 months might be legally and ethically tricky, depending on the country's laws. Also, the surrogate's actions were harmful, but the couple might still have a responsibility to the child, even if they didn't cause the situation. They also need to consider the surrogate's well-being and the legal implications of not proceeding with the surrogacy agreement.\n\nThe couple mentions feeling \"selfish or insensitive,\" which shows they're aware of the potential judgment. However, parents should be able to make decisions based on their readiness and circumstances. The surrogate's behavior complicates things, but the couple's primary responsibility is to their future child and their own family dynamic.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, surrogacy agreements outline the rights and responsibilities of all parties. If the surrogate breached the agreement by using substances, the couple might have legal recourse. However, even if they can legally refuse the baby, there's an ethical question about the child's welfare. Aborting the pregnancy could prevent the child from being born with disabilities, but it's a complex decision.\n\nOverall, the couple's decision isn't straightforward. They're facing a difficult situation with multiple factors. While their decision might be seen as harsh by some, it's important to consider their right to make choices about their family and future. The surrogate's actions also play a role, but the couple's primary concern is their ability to parent. Therefore, whether they're in the wrong depends on legal, ethical, and personal values.\n"
