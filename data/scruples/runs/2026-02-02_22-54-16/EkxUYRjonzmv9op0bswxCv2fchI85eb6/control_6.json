It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves surrogacy and some ethical dilemmas.\n\nFirst, the couple tried for a long time to have a child, but the wife has medical issues, so they went through a surrogacy agency. Surrogacy is altruistic there, not for profit. The surrogate is five months pregnant. Then they had an amniocentesis that showed a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The couple didn't expect this and now, the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy because of stress.\n\nThey're questioning if they're the bad guys for not wanting the baby anymore. The options are whether they're in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The couple's reasons for not wanting the child anymore are the health issues and the surrogate's actions. They also mention they didn't expect this and aren't ready for the responsibilities of caring for a child with those conditions. But they also state they were fine with less than perfect pregnancies, which adds complexity.\n\nOn one hand, they had a right to know the baby's health status, and the surrogate broke the agreement by using substances during pregnancy. That could be a breach of the surrogacy contract, especially if there were terms about avoiding harmful behaviors. So, maybe the couple has grounds to reconsider, especially if the surrogate violated the agreement. Also, the health issues might affect the child's life, and the couple might feel they can't provide the necessary care. They might not be in the wrong for reevaluating their decision given new information.\n\nOn the other hand, they were aware of potential risks when entering surrogacy. The surrogate's actions could be seen as irresponsible, but they might have been under stress. The couple's decision to potentially refuse the baby could be viewed as selfish, especially if the child has a right to life. Also, legally, in some jurisdictions, once a pregnancy is started with consent, the surrogacy arrangement might require the couple to follow through unless there's a legal reason to terminate, especially if the surrogate's actions endangered the child.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not legal technicalities. Ethically, it's tricky. They might be making a hard decision for the right reasons, but it's also about the child's future. The surrogate's behavior complicates things. If the couple didn't know about the substance use, they might have a different perspective. Now that they know, they might feel they can't trust the surrogate's care, adding to their hesitation.\n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because they're making a difficult decision based on new information and potential risks to the child. The surrogate's actions also play a role here. They have the right to consider their ability to provide care. However, this is a complex ethical issue with no clear right or wrong, but given the circumstances, the author's position is justifiable.\n"
