It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for considering refusing a child via surrogacy after finding out about potential disabilities and the surrogate's substance use. \n\nFirst, the couple went through a lot to have a child due to medical issues. They used a surrogacy agency because the wife can't carry the pregnancy. Now, the surrogate is five months pregnant. The amniocentesis results show high chances of Down Syndrome and Spina Bifida. The surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy.\n\nThe couple is conflicted. They didn't expect these complications and feel unprepared to be caregivers for a child with such needs. They're also upset about the surrogate's actions. The question is, are they in the wrong for not wanting the baby anymore?\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if surrogacy is altruistic and not for profit, the laws might vary. But in many places, especially with altruistic surrogacy, the intended parents have rights, especially if there were legal agreements. However, if the surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) contributed to the child's conditions, that might affect things. But the couple is considering refusal, which could lead to ethical and legal questions.\n\nEthically, the couple has the right to make decisions about their family and future. They have a right to be informed about the health of the child and the circumstances of the pregnancy. The surrogate's substance use is a breach of the trust and medical guidelines. The couple's decision could be seen as prioritizing their ability to provide proper care. However, some might argue that once a pregnancy is underway, the child's life should be protected regardless of disabilities. But the couple's stance is that they're not ready to take on the caregiving role, which is a personal choice.\n\nThe surrogate's actions complicate things. If she violated medical advice by using substances, the couple might argue that the agency or legal terms should address such breaches. They might have options to terminate the agreement, especially if the surrogate's behavior endangered the child. However, terminating the pregnancy might be an option, but they\u2019re considering refusal after birth, which is more complicated.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the couple isn't in the wrong for reevaluating their situation. They had medical information that changed their perspective. The surrogate's actions added another layer of concern. They\u2019re considering the child's well-being and their own capacity to care, which is a valid consideration. However, there's a debate about whether refusing a child after a pregnancy is ethically acceptable, especially if the child is viable and would need support. But given the circumstances, their decision seems to be based on a realistic assessment of their situation and the surrogate's conduct.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The answer is B (they are not in the wrong). They have valid reasons related to their readiness and the surrogate's actions. Their right to make decisions about their family's future is personal, and while their choice may be difficult, it's not inherently unethical. The surrogate's actions also play a role here, which may impact the legal and ethical obligations of the intended parents.\n"
