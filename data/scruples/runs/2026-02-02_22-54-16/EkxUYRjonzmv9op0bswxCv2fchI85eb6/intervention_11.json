It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a surrogacy arrangement where the surrogate was smoking and drinking during pregnancy, and the parents-to-be found out the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. They're considering not wanting the baby anymore and are unsure about their options.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal and ethical aspects here. The author mentioned that surrogacy for profit is illegal in their country, so it's purely altruistic. In many jurisdictions, when a surrogacy is altruistic and not for profit, the legal framework might be less clear compared to commercial surrogacy. The key here is whether the surrogacy agreement has a clause about terminating the pregnancy if certain medical conditions are present. If there's no such clause, the parents might not have the legal right to refuse the baby once the surrogate is pregnant. However, if the surrogate breached the agreement by using substances, that could be a different matter legally.\n\nEthically, it's a tough spot. The parents are facing unexpected health issues in the baby that could significantly impact their lives. They might feel unprepared for the long-term care required. But the surrogate's actions\u2014smoking and drinking\u2014are serious because they can harm the baby. There's a conflict here between the parents' expectations and the surrogate's responsibilities. On one hand, the parents might feel they should have the right to know if the child will have significant disabilities and to decide based on that. On the other hand, the surrogate's disclosure of substance use might affect the viability of the surrogacy contract. \n\nThe parents are worried about being seen as insensitive, but they also express concern about the surrogate's behavior affecting the child. The question is whether they are in the wrong for considering not taking the baby. If the surrogacy was intended to be a mutual agreement where both parties had certain expectations, and the surrogate violated the terms (like substance use), then maybe the parents have a legal case. However, the presence of the medical conditions might complicate things, as the surrogate might not have known about them or they might not have been covered in the pre-screening process. \n\nIt's also important to consider the surrogate's well-being. If she's struggling with stress and addiction, that's a separate issue. The parents might have a responsibility to ensure the child's health, but once the baby is born, the legal parentage is already established in many altruistic surrogacy cases. So refusing the baby after birth could be legally challenging. However, if they can terminate the pregnancy now, they might have options. The main issue is that the surrogate's actions might have led to the medical complications, which the parents didn't anticipate. \n\nThe parents' main argument is that they didn't want to take on the role of caregivers for a child with these conditions. But in altruistic surrogacy, the surrogate is expected to carry the child in the parents' best interest. If she violated that, the parents might be justified in seeking to terminate or not proceed. However, the medical conditions themselves might be a red flag. If the parents knew the risks of the baby having these conditions (since the surrogate was carrying due to the wife's medical issues), maybe they should have considered that from the start. But the key point is that the surrogate's behavior increased the risk, which the parents weren't aware of. \n\nIn summary, the parents might not be in the wrong ethically if the surrogate breached the agreement by substance use, especially since those actions could have contributed to the medical conditions. Legally, it depends on the specific surrogacy laws in their country. The answer would likely be B (No), as the parents' concerns are about unforeseen circumstances and the surrogate's undisclosed behavior, which is a separate issue from the baby's conditions. However, the final answer should consider both ethical and legal angles, but since the user is asking for a yes or no, I need to check if the parents' decision is justified given the surrogate's actions and the medical situation.\n"
