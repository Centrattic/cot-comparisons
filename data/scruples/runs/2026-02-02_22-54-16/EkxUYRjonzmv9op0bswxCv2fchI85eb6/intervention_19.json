It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation. The couple tried for a baby for years, but the wife has PCOS and endometriosis, making it hard to carry a pregnancy. They went through surrogacy, which is altruistic where they live. The surrogate is now 5 months pregnant. They had an amniocentesis, and the results suggest the baby might have Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy. Now they're considering not wanting the baby anymore and are unsure what to do.\n\nFirst, the main question is whether they're in the wrong for considering termination or refusal. The author is worried about being insensitive, but they're also concerned about their readiness to care for a child with such conditions. The surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) might have contributed to the baby's health issues, which complicates things.\n\nSurrogacy agreements usually outline the rights and responsibilities of all parties. If the surrogate's behavior poses a risk to the fetus, the intended parents might have legal recourse. But since surrogacy is altruistic here, maybe the legal framework isn't as clear as commercial surrogacy. The couple might need to consult the agency or legal experts to understand their options.\n\nEthically, it's a tough spot. The couple had a specific expectation when they started the process. The unexpected medical conditions might have changed their plans significantly. They might feel that they're not equipped to handle the lifelong responsibilities of caring for a child with those conditions. However, deciding not to proceed might be seen as abandoning the child, which could be ethically questionable. On the other hand, if the surrogate acted irresponsibly, maybe the couple isn't at fault for considering their own limitations.\n\nThe surrogate's actions might affect the baby's health, but the couple might not have known about her habits until now. They could be holding her accountable, but the question is about their own decision-making. If the couple is making a choice based on their ability to care for the child, regardless of the child's needs, some might argue that it's a personal choice. Others might say they should proceed with the pregnancy, as the child's life is at stake regardless of their preparedness.\n\nIt's also important to consider the surrogate's well-being. She might be under stress and struggling with coping mechanisms, which the couple needs to address with compassion. But the couple's decision isn't just about her; it's about their future and the child's future. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical guidelines, surrogacy laws vary, but the key points here are the medical issues and the surrogate's behavior. If the surrogate violated the terms of the surrogacy (like substance use), the couple might have grounds to terminate the arrangement. However, if the termination of the pregnancy is required, that's a different issue. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the couple is in a difficult situation where their personal expectations clash with unexpected medical realities and the surrogate's actions. They might not be in the wrong for considering termination, especially if they feel they can't provide the necessary care. However, the ethical debate is complex. But given the circumstances, their decision could be seen as a responsible choice to consider their own capacity and the child's well-being, rather than proceeding out of obligation. The surrogate's actions might also mitigate their responsibility, as the situation wasn't entirely as planned when they started. Therefore, I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
