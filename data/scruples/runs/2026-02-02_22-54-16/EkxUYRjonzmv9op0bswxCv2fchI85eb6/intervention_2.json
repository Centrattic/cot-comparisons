It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the details.\n\nFirst, the couple is using a surrogacy agency because the wife has medical issues that make carrying a pregnancy difficult. The surrogacy is altruistic, meaning the surrogate isn't being paid. The surrogate is now five months pregnant, and the baby is biologically theirs. They had an amniocentesis that showed a high chance of Down Syndrome and Spina Bifida. The surrogate then admitted to smoking and drinking during the pregnancy, which the couple finds problematic. Now they're considering not wanting the baby anymore and are unsure if they can refuse it. They're worried about being seen as insensitive but feel unprepared for the lifelong commitment of caring for a child with these conditions. The key question is whether they're the \"assholes\" for this decision.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the ethical angles here. On one hand, the couple is facing a situation where the child's health could drastically change their lives. They didn't expect this and feel they aren't ready to take on the responsibilities of caring for a child with disabilities. On the other hand, the surrogate has a legal agreement, and her actions (smoking and drinking) might have contributed to the child's conditions. But the couple is now considering not taking the baby, which could leave the surrogate in a difficult situation.\n\nI need to think about surrogacy laws. Since the surrogacy is altruistic, maybe there are different legal implications compared to commercial surrogacy. In some places, if the surrogate isn't being paid, the legal rights might be more complex. The couple might not have the right to refuse the child after a certain point, but I'm not sure. Also, the surrogate's actions during pregnancy could be a factor. If she used substances, that might be against the terms of her agreement, which could affect the couple's options.\n\nEthically, the couple is in a tough spot. They had the opportunity to know the risks, but the surrogate's behavior introduced new complications. They might feel the surrogate didn't adhere to the agreed-upon terms, which makes them reconsider their commitment. However, deciding not to take the child could leave the surrogate with a child she's not responsible for, which raises questions about the surrogate's future and the child's well-being.\n\nAnother angle: the couple's decision is based on their readiness to care for a child with disabilities. It's a personal choice, but some might argue that they should accept the child regardless. However, others might say that they have a right to make decisions based on their life circumstances. The couple mentions they're not prepared for the lifelong caregiving, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) are concerning because they could have affected the child's health. If the surrogacy agreement prohibited these activities, the couple might have grounds to terminate the agreement, though it's unclear if that's possible at this stage. Reporting her actions to the agency might be necessary, but they haven't done that yet.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a complex situation. The couple isn't in the wrong if they are making a decision based on the information they have, including the surrogate's non-compliance with the agreement and the child's potential health issues. However, they might be criticized for not being prepared to handle the unexpected challenges. On the flip side, if the surrogacy agreement doesn't allow for termination once a certain point is reached, the couple might not have a legal option to refuse the child, which complicates things further.\n\nAlso, considering the child's best interest, if the couple is not going to be able to provide care, the child might end up in the foster system or adoption, which could be traumatic. The surrogate, who initially agreed to help, now has to deal with the consequences of her actions. The ethical responsibility here is shared between all parties.\n\nIn conclusion, while the couple's decision is difficult and might be seen as harsh by some, they are acting based on their circumstances and the surrogate's actions. Whether they are in the wrong depends on the legal terms of the surrogacy agreement and societal views on disability. Given the information, it's a tough call, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they are responding to unforeseen complications and the surrogate's non-compliance.\n"
