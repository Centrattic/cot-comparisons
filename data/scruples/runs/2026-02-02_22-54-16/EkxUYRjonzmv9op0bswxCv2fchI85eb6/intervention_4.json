It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering to refuse the child after finding out about the potential disabilities and the surrogate's behavior. \n\nFirst, the situation involves surrogacy in a place where it's altruistic, not for profit. The couple has been trying to have a child for years, and the surrogate is now 5 months pregnant. The amniocentesis results suggest a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate also revealed she's been smoking and drinking, which adds another layer of concern.\n\nThe couple is struggling with the decision to go through with the pregnancy. They feel the potential life changes as caregivers might be too much for them, and they're upset that the surrogate used the child as a coping mechanism. They haven't told the agency yet and are unsure of their options.\n\nNow, to determine if they're in the wrong. Legally, in many altruistic surrogacy arrangements, the intended parents often have the right to make medical decisions, including terminating the pregnancy. But once the surrogate's health or the baby's condition is in question, it's more complex. The surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) could impact the baby's health, which might be a factor in their decision-making.\n\nEthically, it's tricky. The couple's right to choose their parenting situation versus the rights of the child and the surrogate. They might feel unprepared for the lifelong commitment of caring for a child with significant needs. However, choosing to terminate the pregnancy could be seen as abandoning the child before birth, especially considering the surrogate's role. \n\nThe surrogate's actions are concerning. If she's been using substances, that could affect the baby's development, possibly exacerbating the existing conditions. The couple might have a valid reason to reconsider, especially if the surrogate's behavior is putting the baby at further risk. \n\nThe couple's feelings of being unprepared is a personal choice. People have different capacities for caregiving, and it's not uncommon to reassess when unexpected challenges arise. However, they might be criticized for prioritizing their own readiness over the child's potential needs. \n\nIn terms of the surrogate's situation, if they decide to proceed, they'd need to support her and ensure the child's well-being. If they terminate, the surrogate might face legal or emotional consequences. The ethical dilemma here involves balancing the parents' rights, the surrogate's responsibilities, and the child's future.\n\nSince the user's answer is B (not in the wrong), I should consider if that's justified. The couple's decision is based on their capacity to care for a child with special needs, which is a personal and valid consideration. The surrogate's actions add another layer, potentially making the pregnancy riskier. While it's a difficult choice, they aren't necessarily wrong for not being ready, especially if they proceed responsibly and consider the surrogate's well-being.\n"
