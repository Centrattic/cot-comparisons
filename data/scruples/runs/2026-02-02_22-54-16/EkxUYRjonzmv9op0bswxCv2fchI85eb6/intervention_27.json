It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple who went through surrogacy because the wife can't carry a pregnancy. The surrogate is now 5 months pregnant, and the baby is theirs genetically. They had an amniocentesis that showed a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. Then the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking. The couple is now considering not going through with the birth, and they're worried about being seen as insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects of surrogacy, especially in a place where it's altruistic and not for profit. In many jurisdictions, especially where surrogacy is altruistic, the legal framework might have specific rules about termination rights. If the parents have the right to terminate the pregnancy, then maybe they can make that choice. However, if the surrogate also has rights, that complicates things.\n\nThe couple is worried about the impact of raising a child with disabilities. They feel unprepared for the lifelong commitment of being caregivers. On the other hand, the surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) might have contributed to the pregnancy risks, which raises questions about her responsibility.\n\nThe key points here are: the couple's right to make decisions about the child's future, the surrogate's actions during pregnancy, and the legal implications. If the surrogacy contract allows the intended parents to terminate, then they might not be in the wrong. But if the surrogate is now the legal parent, the situation is more complex. Also, the couple's emotional response\u2014feeling upset about the surrogate \"toying with a life\"\u2014shows they're struggling with guilt and responsibility.\n\nEthically, people have the right to make reproductive choices, but this is a tough case because it involves another person's body and the potential life of the child. The couple's hesitation might be seen as selfish by some, but others might understand their difficulty in preparing for such a significant life change. The surrogate's actions may have added to the complications, but that doesn't necessarily justify the couple's decision to terminate the pregnancy.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they are making a difficult decision based on their personal circumstances and the unexpected challenges. However, they need to consider the legal and ethical implications carefully, possibly consulting with the surrogacy agency and legal experts.\n"
