It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. First, I need to understand the situation. The couple is using a surrogate because the wife can't carry a pregnancy. The surrogate is now five months pregnant, and the baby is biologically theirs. They found out through an amniocentesis that the baby has a high chance of Down Syndrome and spina bifida. Also, the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during the pregnancy, which might have contributed to the health issues.\n\nThe couple is considering refusing the child now. They're worried about the implications of raising a child with these conditions and feel unprepared. They're also upset that the surrogate might have contributed to the baby's problems by her behavior. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not wanting the child anymore.\n\nFirst, I should consider surrogacy agreements. In many cases, surrogacy arrangements are legal contracts. If the surrogate is altruistic and not for profit, maybe there are different legal terms. The couple might have agreed to accept the child regardless of health issues, especially since they knew the biological parents had PCOS and endometriosis, which might have been considered risks. But maybe they didn't anticipate specific conditions like Down Syndrome.\n\nNext, the surrogate's actions. She admitted to smoking and drinking, which are harmful during pregnancy. That could be a breach of the surrogacy agreement. If the contract requires the surrogate to avoid such behaviors, she might be in violation. The couple could potentially pursue legal action against her for this. However, if they're now considering not taking the child, they might face legal challenges. Depending on the jurisdiction, they might not have the right to refuse the child once the pregnancy is at an advanced stage. Surrogacy laws often protect the surrogate's right to carry the pregnancy unless there's a specific clause allowing the intended parents to terminate under certain conditions.\n\nEthically, the couple is struggling with the decision to become caregivers for a child with significant needs. They might feel that they're not prepared for that life change. However, the child's rights also come into play. The child is biologically theirs, but legally, the surrogate might have some rights depending on the laws of their country. Also, the couple's decision not to take the child could leave the surrogate in a difficult position, potentially needing to raise the child herself, which might not be feasible.\n\nAnother angle is the initial agreement. Did the surrogacy contract address the possibility of genetic or health issues? If it's a strict altruistic surrogacy without such clauses, the couple might be legally bound to accept the child. If they proceed to refuse the child, they might face legal consequences, or the child could end up in foster care or another placement, which complicates matters.\n\nThe surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) might give the couple grounds to question the surrogate's compliance with the agreement, but that doesn't necessarily mean they can refuse the child. They might need to address the surrogate's behavior through the agency or legally, but the refusal of the child is a separate issue.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the couple's feelings about being unprepared are valid. Raising a child with significant disabilities is a major commitment. However, legally and ethically, there's a question about their responsibility to the child and the surrogate. If they proceed with the refusal, they might be seen as abandoning a child they created through surrogacy, which could be viewed as unethical, even if they have the child's DNA. The child's well-being is a priority, so refusing it could be seen as inhumane.\n\nSo, considering all these factors: legal obligations, the surrogacy agreement, the surrogate's conduct, and the ethical implications of refusing the child, the authors might be in the wrong if they proceed to refuse the child unless there's a legal clause allowing them to do so under these circumstances. Their decision could harm both the child and the surrogate, and they might be breaching their agreement.\n"
