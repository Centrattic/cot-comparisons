It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering refusing an unborn child with potential disabilities due to the surrogate's actions.\n\nFirst, the couple used a surrogate because the wife couldn't carry the pregnancy. Surrogacy here is altruistic, so there's no financial incentive. The surrogate revealed she drank and smoked during pregnancy, which could have contributed to the baby's conditions. The couple is now considering not wanting the child because of Down syndrome and spina bifida, fearing the lifestyle change.\n\nNow, legal and ethical aspects. In many places, surrogacy agreements can have clauses about termination if issues are found. Since the surrogate broke the agreement by using substances, the couple might have grounds to terminate the arrangement. However, the baby is already in the second trimester, so termination might be legally restricted. \n\nEthically, the couple's concern is about being caregivers for life, which is a valid personal choice. They might feel they're not equipped to handle the challenges. The surrogate's actions could be seen as negligent, affecting the child's health.\n\nBut there's a counterpoint: the baby is biologically theirs, and they might feel responsible. Also, the surrogate's stress leading to substance use complicates things. They might be seen as abandoning a child, which could be morally questionable.\n\nHowever, given the surrogate violated the agreement, the couple has rights to reconsider. Their decision isn't about the disability itself but the unpreparedness and the surrogate's negligence. So, they might not be in the wrong. Answer B seems correct.\n"
