It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple using a surrogate who smoked and drank during pregnancy. The baby has a high chance of Down Syndrome and Spina Bifida, and the couple is considering refusing the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Surrogacy laws vary, but in this case, it's altruistic and not for profit. The surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) might be a breach of the agreed terms, especially if the surrogacy contract included health guidelines. If the contract prohibited such behaviors, the couple might have legal grounds to reconsider.\n\nEthically, the couple's decision is complex. They might feel they're not prepared for the challenges of raising a child with significant needs. However, the surrogate's actions could have endangered the child's health. The couple might argue that the surrogate's behavior compromised the pregnancy, making them question the child's viability.\n\nThere's also the aspect of their initial stance: they wanted a family and had been trying for years. The unexpected medical findings add another layer. They might feel they didn't consent to these circumstances, which changes their life's trajectory. But is it their right to refuse the child now, especially after the surrogate's actions?\n\nThe couple hasn't reported the surrogate yet, which could indicate they're trying to understand their options. They might be conflicted between their responsibilities and their ability to care for the child. The surrogate's admission of stress and coping mechanisms shows she was under pressure, which complicates the situation. She might need support, but her actions could affect the child's health.\n\nLegally, if the surrogacy agreement allowed termination in certain conditions or if the surrogate violated terms, the couple might have options. However, if the baby is already born, they might have a legal obligation to parent it. If they terminate the pregnancy, the surrogate could face legal consequences, depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nEthically, the couple's concern about being caregivers for life is valid. But they might be criticized for focusing on their own readiness rather than the child's best interests. However, the surrogate's actions could be seen as the reason the pregnancy is compromised.\n\nIn summary, the couple's decision hinges on legal agreements, the surrogate's adherence to them, and their ethical considerations. They might not be in the wrong if the surrogate breached the contract, but they do need to follow proper legal channels. However, if the surrogacy agreement didn't cover these scenarios, their situation is more complicated.\n"
