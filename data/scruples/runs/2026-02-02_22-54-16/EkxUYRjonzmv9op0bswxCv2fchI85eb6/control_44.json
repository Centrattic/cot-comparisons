It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves surrogacy, and the couple is considering refusing the child after finding out the baby might have Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The scenario mentions that surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's altruistic. In many jurisdictions, especially with altruistic surrogacy, the legal rights and responsibilities can be complex. If the couple has legal parentage established, they might have the right to make decisions regarding the child. However, if they can't terminate the pregnancy now, they might be legally bound to take the child.\n\nEthically, the couple's decision is tricky. They argue that they aren't ready to care for a child with such needs, and they feel the surrogate compromised the baby's health. But choosing not to take the child could leave the surrogate with the burden, and the child without parents. There's also the question of whether they're being insensitive by prioritizing their own desires over the child's potential life.\n\nThe surrogate's actions are concerning because smoking and drinking during pregnancy can harm the fetus. However, revealing this after the fact complicates things. The couple might feel betrayed, which affects their decision-making. But legally, they might not have a case against her unless there's a contract violation.\n\nThe couple's fear of being seen as insensitive is valid. Public opinion might be divided; some would empathize with their situation, others would criticize them for not taking responsibility. It's important to consider their long-term commitment versus the child's rights.\n\nIn terms of options, if they can't terminate, they might need to explore adoption or legal guardianship. They should consult the surrogacy agency and legal experts to understand their rights and obligations. The answer hinges on whether their decision is legally permissible and ethically justified given the circumstances.\n"
