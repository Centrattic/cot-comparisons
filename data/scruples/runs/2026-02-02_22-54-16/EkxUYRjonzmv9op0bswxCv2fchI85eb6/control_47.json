It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple who went through surrogacy because the wife can't carry a pregnancy. The surrogate is now pregnant, and the baby has a high chance of having Down Syndrome and Spina Bifida. Additionally, the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy. The couple is considering not wanting the baby anymore and is unsure of their legal options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The couple didn't plan for these disabilities, and they're feeling unprepared to care for a child with such needs. They might feel that their lives would fundamentally change, which is a valid concern. However, the surrogate's actions\u2014smoking and drinking\u2014are significant because they could affect the baby's health further. The surrogate's behavior might also be a breach of the surrogacy agreement, especially if there were terms about avoiding harmful substances.\n\nLegally, since surrogacy is altruistic and not for profit, the rules might differ. The couple might have rights to make decisions regarding the pregnancy, especially if the surrogate's actions endangered the child. However, terminating the pregnancy at 5 months could be legally complex. In some jurisdictions, there might be time limits on termination, but this depends on local laws.\n\nEthically, the couple's decision is about their ability to provide care. It's not uncommon for parents to consider their capacity to care for a child with special needs. But some might argue that life should be protected regardless of circumstances. The surrogate's role is also contentious here; she's supposed to carry the child for the intended parents, so her actions affecting the child's health might be a breach of trust.\n\nThe couple's feelings of being unprepared are understandable, but the decision to continue or terminate involves multiple stakeholders. The surrogate's health and the baby's well-being are also factors. The fact that the surrogate is breaking down suggests she might be under stress, which could affect the pregnancy further. The couple might need to involve the agency and legal counsel to handle this properly.\n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's a tough call. The couple might not be in the wrong if they can legally and ethically make decisions based on the new information, especially considering the surrogate's actions. However, they might also be seen as selfish for not wanting the child after the surrogate's breakdown. But given the circumstances, including the medical issues and the surrogate's behavior, their concerns are valid. The key is whether their decision is legally permissible and ethically sound given the circumstances.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the couple is reacting to unforeseen medical issues and the surrogate's actions that compromise the child's health. They are considering their ability to care for the child, which is a legitimate concern. However, the ethical perspective varies, but legally and ethically, if they can prove the surrogate's actions endangered the child, they might have grounds to make a decision.\n"
