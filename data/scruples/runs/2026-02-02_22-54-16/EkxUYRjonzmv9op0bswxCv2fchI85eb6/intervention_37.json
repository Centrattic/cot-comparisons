It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering refusing the baby conceived via surrogacy. The key points are: they used a surrogate in a country where surrogacy is altruistic, the surrogate has been smoking and drinking, and the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. They're now considering not accepting the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Since it's altruistic surrogacy, the legal framework might differ from commercial ones. In some jurisdictions, the intended parents have legal rights once the embryo transfer is done, but laws vary. The surrogate's actions (drugs/alcohol) could be a legal issue, depending on local laws. If the surrogate breached the agreement, there might be grounds for legal action, but that's a gray area.\n\nEthically, the parents are facing a situation where the child's health could significantly alter their lives. They might feel unprepared for the lifelong care a child with such conditions needs. However, choosing not to accept the baby might be seen as irresponsibility towards the surrogate and the child. The surrogate's actions could also be a factor\u2014did she agree to certain health standards?\n\nThe surrogate's behavior (smoking and drinking) adds another layer. If this was part of the surrogacy agreement that she agreed to avoid, then she might have violated the contract, which could impact the parents' responsibility. But if the parents didn't have prior knowledge of this, they might feel they're being set up for a child they didn't plan for.\n\nThe parents also mention they didn't want the baby, but they're worried about being insensitive. Their reasons are based on their readiness and the potential lifelong commitment. However, there's a moral obligation to consider the surrogate's well-being and the child's future if they decide to proceed. On the other hand, if the surrogate's negligence (using substances) contributed to the child's conditions, it's a different scenario.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer hinges on legal and ethical considerations. Legally, if the parents have the right to refuse due to the surrogate's breach, they might not be at fault. Ethically, the situation is complex. However, the parents' decision to refuse could be seen as self-serving, but given the surrogate's actions and the unexpected challenges, there's a case for them not being in the wrong. The answer is likely B (No), but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
