It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves surrogacy, the discovery of fetal abnormalities, and the surrogate's substance use.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The user mentioned that surrogacy for profit is illegal there, so it's altruistic. If the surrogate broke the agreement by using substances, maybe there are legal consequences. But laws vary, so I'm not sure exactly what applies here.\n\nEthically, the parents are dealing with unexpected challenges. They didn't anticipate Down syndrome and spina bifida, which would change their lives significantly. They might feel they aren't prepared for the responsibilities of caring for a child with these conditions. But is that a valid reason to refuse the child? Some might argue that deciding based on disabilities is discriminatory. Others might say it's their right to make decisions about their family's future.\n\nThe surrogate's actions are a red flag. Smoking and drinking during pregnancy is harmful and could have affected the baby. The parents might feel betrayed, especially since the surrogate was supposed to be altruistic. However, the parents also have a responsibility to ensure the surrogate follows medical guidelines. Did they have any role in monitoring her behavior? Maybe not, since they didn't know until now.\n\nThe parents are in a tough spot. They might be considering terminating the pregnancy or refusing the child after birth. If they proceed with the birth, they'll need to care for a child with disabilities. If they terminate now, they might face ethical criticism. But they also need to consider their own capacity and the child's well-being.\n\nThere's a lot of uncertainty here. The parents haven't reported the surrogate yet, which could have legal implications. The surrogate might face repercussions for her actions. The key question is whether the parents are wrong for not wanting the child because of the disabilities. It's a judgment call. Some might see it as a responsible decision based on their ability to care, while others might see it as abandonment.\n\nI need to weigh the parents' intentions. They mention they're not ready to be caregivers for life, which is a valid concern. But refusing the child could leave the surrogate with the burden of raising a child she didn't plan for. The surrogacy agreement's terms would be crucial here\u2014does it allow termination if certain conditions arise?\n\nIn the end, the answer might hinge on whether the parents' decision is considered self-centered versus realistic. Since they're acting based on their assessment of their ability to care for the child, and the surrogate violated the agreement, they might not be entirely in the wrong. However, the ethical debate is ongoing. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong), but it's a complex issue.\n"
