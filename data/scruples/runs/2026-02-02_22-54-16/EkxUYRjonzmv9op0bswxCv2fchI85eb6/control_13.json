It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a surrogacy arrangement where the surrogate has been smoking and drinking during pregnancy, and the parents want to refuse the baby due to the high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple went through surrogacy because of medical issues. The surrogate is in her fifth month, and the baby has a high risk of significant disabilities. The surrogate admitted to using harmful substances during pregnancy, which adds another layer of concern.\n\nThe main ethical question here is about their right to refuse the child. In altruistic surrogacy, the legal and ethical responsibilities can be complex. If the surrogacy agreement was clear about the terms, including the possibility of terminating if certain conditions arise, maybe the couple isn't entirely at fault. However, the surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) might have contributed to the risks, which complicates things.\n\nThe couple's argument is that they're not prepared for the lifelong commitment of caring for a child with such needs. They feel the surrogate \"toyed with a life,\" implying the surrogate's actions might have contributed to the situation. But the surrogate was under stress and used coping mechanisms, which raises questions about her responsibility versus the parents' responsibility.\n\nLegally, depending on the jurisdiction, the rights and obligations of the intended parents vs. the surrogate vary. If the surrogacy is binding, the couple might be required to take the child. If they can terminate the pregnancy, they have more leeway. However, ethically, the couple's desire to avoid a lifelong caregiving role is understandable but might be seen as prioritizing their own plans over the child's potential life.\n\nThe surrogate's actions complicate things further. She might have breached the trust of the arrangement by using substances during pregnancy, which is harmful. This could shift some responsibility onto her, but the couple's decision to proceed might still be questioned.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, society often values the right to life, but also considers the well-being of the child and the parents' ability to provide care. The couple's fear of being caregivers is real, but so is the potential harm to the child if they proceed with a parent who isn't prepared. The surrogate's health choices also play a role here.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the surrogacy agreement allowed for termination in such cases, maybe not. But if they're now backing out despite the surrogate's actions, they might be seen as not taking responsibility. However, the surrogate's negligence could mitigate their responsibility. It's a tough balance. The answer might depend on the specific laws and the original agreement terms. Since the user is asking for a yes or no answer, considering all factors, I might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the situation is complex, and the couple has legitimate concerns, especially given the surrogate's actions. However, there's a strong argument that they should still proceed if the surrogacy contract is binding. Since they haven't reported the surrogate yet, maybe they're trying to find a middle ground. I think the answer is B.\n"
