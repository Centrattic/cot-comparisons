It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe couple has been trying to have a child for years. The wife has PCOS and endometriosis, making it hard for her to carry a pregnancy. They went through a surrogacy agency, which is altruistic (no money involved). The surrogate is now 5 months pregnant with their biological child. They had an amniocentesis that showed a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate then admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy, which adds to their concerns. Now the couple is considering not wanting the baby anymore and are unsure if they can back out or what the consequences might be. They're worried about being seen as insensitive but feel unprepared for the lifelong care of a child with those conditions.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal and ethical aspects. The surrogacy is altruistic, so maybe the legal framework is different compared to commercial surrogacy. They might have a contract, but I'm not sure if it covers termination or what happens if the child has disabilities. If the surrogate is breaking her agreement by using substances, that could be a problem. But if the contract is only for carrying, not about the health of the child, maybe the couple's options are limited.\n\nThen there's the ethical part. The couple is facing a situation where they may not be able to care for a child with significant needs. They might be worried about the impact on their lives and the child's well-being. But they also feel guilty for considering termination or not accepting the child. The surrogate's actions might complicate things further, as her behavior could have affected the pregnancy.\n\nI should think about the options. If the pregnancy is terminated, what happens to the surrogate? She might be left in a difficult situation. If they go ahead, the couple is committed to caring for the child, which they're not prepared for. They might also face social judgment for their decision.\n\nAnother angle is the intent behind the surrogacy. The couple wanted their own child, and the surrogate agreed to carry it. The child's health issues are unexpected. The surrogate's substance use might be a separate issue, but it's unclear if that's grounds for termination of the agreement.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, maybe the couple isn't in the wrong because they made a decision based on their inability to provide the necessary care. However, the surrogate's actions could be a red flag that they should have known about earlier. But they only found out after the amniocentesis.\n\nAlso, considering the emotional stress: the surrogate is already under stress and might be struggling. The couple's decision could affect her mentally and physically. But the couple's own capacity to handle the situation is also a factor.\n\nI think this is a complex situation where both parties have their own challenges. The couple's decision is based on their ability to care for the child, which is a valid concern. The surrogate's actions might have contributed to the current dilemma, but it's not entirely her fault either. The legality of the surrogacy and the terms of the agreement would play a big role here. Without knowing the specifics, it's hard to say if the couple is in the wrong. However, from an ethical standpoint, the couple's primary responsibility is to their own family and their ability to provide care. They might not be in the wrong for realizing they aren't prepared for the demands of raising a child with such conditions. So, I think the answer is B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
