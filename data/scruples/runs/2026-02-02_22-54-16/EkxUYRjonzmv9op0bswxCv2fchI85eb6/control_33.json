It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe couple went through surrogacy because the wife has medical issues. They found a surrogate who's altruistic, not for profit. Now, at five months, they found out the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. Also, the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy. The couple is considering not wanting the baby anymore and is unsure if they can refuse it. They're worried about being called insensitive and are conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In the country where this is happening, surrogacy is altruistic. So legal terms might not allow them to terminate the pregnancy after a certain point. Also, the surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) might have contributed to the baby's conditions. But the couple didn't know about this before. \n\nEthically, they're facing a dilemma. They didn't expect the baby to have such conditions and feel unprepared to care for a child with those needs. They might feel it's selfish to continue, but they're also responsible for the surrogate's well-being now. \n\nThe surrogate broke down, indicating stress. Maybe she didn't know the full implications of her actions. The couple might be in a tough spot because the surrogate isn't taking proper care of the baby, which is not their responsibility. However, they had already agreed to the surrogacy, and now they're considering backing out. \n\nLegal options: If surrogacy is altruistic, there might not be a legal recourse to terminate or back out. The couple could be legally obligated to proceed. Also, the surrogate's actions might have legal consequences, but that's different from the couple's decision.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the couple is dealing with a situation they never anticipated. They have the right to decide their family's future, especially if they can't handle the lifelong commitment of caring for a child with severe disabilities. However, the surrogate's actions complicate things. But the couple didn't cause the surrogate's behavior; they might have no control over that.\n\nThe question is whether they're in the wrong. If they decide to proceed, they might face a heavy burden. If they refuse, they might abandon the child, but the surrogate could also be held accountable. However, since they're the intended parents, they're the ones who would have to care for the child. \n\nThe key points are the unexpected medical issues and the surrogate's negligence. The couple isn't at fault for the child's medical conditions. They might feel they're not in the wrong because they're making a difficult choice based on their preparedness. The surrogate's actions are her responsibility, but the couple might have no power to prevent that. \n\nI think the answer would be B (No), because the couple isn't in the wrong for wanting to make a decision that's right for their family, given the circumstances. They didn't know about the surrogate's behavior beforehand, and the child's conditions are a result of factors beyond their control. They have the right to choose their path, even if it's hard.\n"
