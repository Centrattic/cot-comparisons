It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who posted this scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves surrogacy, the discovery of fetal abnormalities, and the surrogate's substance use during pregnancy. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering refusing the child.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal and ethical aspects. The surrogacy is altruistic and legal in their country. The surrogate is breaking the agreement by using substances. The parents are concerned about Down syndrome and spina bifida, which significantly impact their lives as caregivers. \n\nLegally, if the surrogacy contract is in place, the parents might have rights. But if the surrogate violated the contract by using drugs, maybe the parents can terminate the agreement. However, once the baby is born, it's not as simple to refuse it. The parents might have legal obligations or rights to make decisions post-birth, but ethically, it's more complex.\n\nEthically, the parents are facing a tough decision. They didn't anticipate the medical issues and now feel unprepared for the lifelong responsibilities. They also feel the surrogate betrayed their trust. On the other hand, the child has a right to be born and receive care, even if the parents aren't prepared. The surrogate's actions were harmful, but the child isn't responsible for that.\n\nThe parents might be seen as making a self-centered choice, but they are also considering their capability to care for a child with significant needs. There's a balance between personal readiness and the child's welfare. The surrogate's actions are definitely unethical and possibly illegal, complicating the situation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they proceed to refuse the baby, they might be seen as insensitive, but if they're acting based on the surrogate's breach of contract and their own limitations, it's a gray area. The answer likely depends on the specific laws and ethical standards of their jurisdiction. But since the question is whether they are in the wrong, considering the parents' intentions and the surrogate's misconduct, it's a nuanced situation where the parents might not be entirely at fault.\n"
