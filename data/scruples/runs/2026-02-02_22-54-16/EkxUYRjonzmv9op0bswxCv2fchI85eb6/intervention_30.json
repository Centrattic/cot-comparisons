It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple tried for a child for years but couldn't conceive naturally due to the wife's medical conditions. They went through a surrogacy agency, which is altruistic where they are. The surrogate is 5 months pregnant, and the baby is biologically theirs. They had an amniocentesis that showed a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. Now, the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy, which adds to their concerns. The couple is considering refusing the baby but are unsure if they're in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider the ethical angles here. The couple is worried about being caregivers for a child with significant needs, which would change their lives. They might feel unprepared for that long-term commitment. On the other hand, the surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) could have affected the baby's health, but they already knew about the genetic risks from the test. \n\nThe main question is whether the couple is in the wrong for not wanting the baby now. Legally, since surrogacy is altruistic, the couple might have certain rights, but that's not clear. Ethically, they have the right to make decisions based on their readiness and circumstances. However, the surrogate's actions complicate things. The couple might feel betrayed, but the surrogate was under stress. \n\nThe author argues they're not in the wrong because they didn't anticipate the situation and aren't ready. They mention not wanting to be caregivers for a lifetime. The surrogate's actions might have increased the baby's health risks, but the couple's decision is based on the test results, not the surrogate's behavior. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a tough decision based on their readiness and the unexpected circumstances. The surrogate's actions are a factor, but the couple's right to choose their family circumstances is a valid consideration. They're also considering the child's future and their ability to provide care, which is a responsible stance.\n"
