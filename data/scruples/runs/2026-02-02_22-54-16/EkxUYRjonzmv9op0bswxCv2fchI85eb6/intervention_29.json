It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering refusing the child conceived via surrogacy. The situation involves a lot of factors.\n\nFirst, the couple had surrogacy arranged because the wife couldn't carry a pregnancy. The surrogate is now five months pregnant, and the baby is genetically theirs. The amniocentesis shows a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy, which is concerning.\n\nThe couple is considering not wanting the baby anymore. They feel unprepared for the challenges of raising a child with such conditions and are worried about the surrogate's actions affecting the child. They're also unsure about their legal options and the consequences of not taking the child.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong... Well, surrogacy agreements, especially altruistic ones, might not have the same legal protections as commercial ones. The couple might have thought they were committing to this child, but the unexpected health issues and the surrogate's behavior are complicating things. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, once the pregnancy is under way, the surrogate has certain rights. The couple might not have the right to refuse the child, especially if the pregnancy is already in the second trimester. But ethically, it's a tough call. The couple is making a personal choice based on their readiness and the challenges they're not prepared for. However, they might be seen as abandoning a child they were involved in creating. \n\nThe surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) could be a contributing factor. However, the couple's responsibility to the child is also a point to consider. They might feel they can't provide the necessary care, which is a valid concern. But is it their right to refuse the child? That's a key point here. \n\nI think the answer depends on the legal framework in their country. Since the surrogacy is altruistic, maybe there are no legal provisions for termination. The couple could be in a difficult spot where they feel they can't go through with it, but legally they might have no choice. Ethically, it's complex. They're not wrong for being unprepared, but they might be in the wrong if they can't back out and proceed with the birth, especially if the surrogate is legally bound. \n\nBut the user's main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering the information, the author is struggling with a difficult situation. They might not be in the wrong for feeling this way, but they might be in the wrong if they can't follow through with the commitment they made through surrogacy. However, without legal clarity, it's hard to say. Since the user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, and considering the ethical complexity, I think the answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong), but it's a nuanced issue.\n"
