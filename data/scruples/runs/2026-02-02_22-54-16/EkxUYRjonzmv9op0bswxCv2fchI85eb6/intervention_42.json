It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe couple has been trying to have a child for years. The wife has PCOS and endometriosis, making it hard to carry a pregnancy. They went through a surrogacy agency, which is altruistic since it's illegal for profit in their area. The surrogate is now 5 months pregnant, and the baby is theirs biologically. They had an amniocentesis that showed a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy, which adds another layer of concern. The couple is now considering not taking the baby, but they're unsure if they can back out and what that would mean for the surrogate and the child.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering this refusal. The user thinks the author isn't wrong. I need to weigh both sides.\n\nFirst, the couple's situation is difficult. They went through a lot to have a child, but the unexpected complications are making them reconsider. Down syndrome and spina bifida are significant conditions that require lifelong care. The couple might feel unprepared for that responsibility, which is a valid concern. They're also upset that the surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) might have contributed to the baby's health issues, which adds to their stress.\n\nOn the other hand, the surrogate is in a vulnerable position. She's been through a pregnancy and might feel guilt or trauma. If the couple proceeds with termination, it could have emotional and legal repercussions. Also, if the baby is born, the couple's decision could leave the child without parents, leading to possible adoption or other arrangements. The couple might be seen as abandoning the child, which could be ethically questionable.\n\nLegal aspects are important too. In some places, surrogacy agreements might have clauses about termination or unexpected medical conditions. The couple needs to check their legal rights and obligations. If they can't terminate the pregnancy, they might have to proceed with the birth and then decide whether to adopt out the child or take it on. However, the surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) could complicate things legally, as those are harmful to the fetus.\n\nEthically, the couple is facing a tough choice between their own preparedness and the child's well-being. They might be seen as selfish if they choose not to take the child, especially if the child is healthy and in need of a family. However, they also have a right to consider their own capabilities and life circumstances when making such a significant decision.\n\nThe surrogate's behavior is a red flag. If she broke the surrogacy agreement by using harmful substances, the couple might have grounds to seek legal intervention. But the couple hasn't reported this yet, possibly because they're still processing the information and the medical results.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the couple's decision is complex. They didn't anticipate the medical issues and the surrogate's actions. They might feel they're making a responsible choice by considering their ability to provide care, even though it's a hard decision. However, others might argue that once the pregnancy is underway, they have a responsibility to see it through, especially if the surrogate is carrying their biological child.\n\nI think the key here is that the couple is in a position where they need to balance their own circumstances with ethical considerations towards the surrogate and potential child. Their decision isn't straightforward, and there are valid arguments on both sides. However, given the circumstances and their lack of preparedness for the child's needs, along with the surrogate's non-compliance with the agreement, the couple might not be in the wrong. So I'm leaning towards answer B, that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
