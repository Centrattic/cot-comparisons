It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering refusing a child with potential disabilities via surrogacy. The situation involves a couple who discovered through amniocentesis that their unborn child may have Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate also revealed she's been smoking and drinking during pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The couple went through a lot to have a biological child, but now they're facing a situation where the child's needs might be more than they anticipated. They're not sure if they can refuse the baby, and they're worried about the surrogate's well-being and the child's future.\n\nSurrogacy laws vary, but in this case, it's altruistic and not for profit. So the legal aspect might be tricky. The surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) could affect the baby's health, which adds another layer. The couple might feel they weren't given full disclosure, which could affect their decision-making.\n\nThe couple's main concern is their readiness to care for a child with significant needs. They admit they didn't anticipate this and aren't prepared for the lifelong commitment. Is it wrong to reconsider parenthood under these circumstances? On one hand, they have the right to make decisions about their family. On the other hand, the child's future and the surrogate's well-being are important.\n\nAlso, the surrogate's actions might have contributed to the situation, so the couple might feel betrayed. They might need to assess if they can still proceed, considering the added risks from the surrogate's behavior. However, terminating a pregnancy later in gestation is ethically and legally complex, especially in an altruistic surrogacy arrangement.\n\nThe question is whether their desire to refuse the child makes them the \"assholes.\" It's a tough call. They might be acting out of self-awareness of their limitations, but it could also be seen as abandoning a life they partially created. The surrogate's actions complicate things further, as she may have knowingly contributed to the child's potential health issues.\n\nIn the end, the couple's decision is personal. They're not in the wrong for re-evaluating their readiness, given the new information and the surrogate's actions. However, they need to handle the situation with care, considering the surrogate's well-being and exploring all legal options. The answer is B (No), because they're making a difficult choice based on their circumstances and new information.\n"
