It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a surrogacy arrangement where the surrogate has been smoking and drinking, and the DNA test shows a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The couple wants to refuse the baby now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The user mentioned it's altruistic surrogacy where profit is illegal. In some countries, surrogacy agreements can be legally binding, but others might not recognize them. If the surrogate is breaking the agreement by using substances, that could be a legal issue. However, the couple might need to check their surrogacy contract to see if there are clauses about substance use during pregnancy.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The couple has the right to make decisions about their family. If the health risks for the baby are significant, they might feel unprepared for the lifelong commitment of raising a child with those conditions. The surrogate's actions could also be a factor here; if she violated the trust and the agreed terms, that might justify the couple's decision.\n\nThe surrogate's well-being is another angle. She's under stress and using substances as a coping mechanism, which is concerning. The couple might need to support her but also consider their own needs. It's a complex situation where both parties have responsibilities and rights.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong. They might be focusing on the couple's right to choose not to proceed, especially given the surrogate's actions and the unexpected health issues. However, others might argue that once a pregnancy is underway, there's an ethical obligation to continue, regardless of unforeseen complications.\n\nI should also consider the impact on the child. If the couple decides not to proceed, the child's future would need to be considered, possibly through adoption. But the legal framework for surrogacy might not allow the couple to terminate the pregnancy at this stage, depending on local laws.\n\nIn summary, the answer hinges on legal rights, ethical responsibilities, and the unforeseen circumstances. The couple's desire to avoid an unexpected situation that they feel unprepared for might be justified, especially if the surrogate's actions violated their agreement. However, the decision isn't straightforward and involves multiple factors.\n"
