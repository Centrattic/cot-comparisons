It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple tried for a long time to have a child and used a surrogate because of medical issues. Surrogacy is altruistic in their country. The surrogate is now 5 months pregnant with their biological child. Then, the amniocentesis results show a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The couple isn't thrilled about these conditions. Then the surrogate admits to smoking and drinking during pregnancy, which adds more stress.\n\nThe couple is considering not wanting the baby anymore. They're worried about being seen as insensitive but feel unprepared for the lifelong care that a child with these conditions might need. The main question is whether they're the \"assholes\" for wanting to back out now.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. On one hand, the couple is making a difficult decision based on their own circumstances and feelings about being ready for a child with special needs. On the other hand, the surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) might affect the baby's health, which complicates things further.\n\nThe key points are: the couple's rights in surrogacy agreements, the surrogate's responsibilities, and the ethical implications of terminating a pregnancy for medical reasons. Since the surrogacy is altruistic and not for profit, maybe there are different legal considerations than in paid surrogacy. Also, the surrogate's actions might have legal consequences, which could affect the couple's options.\n\nThe couple is in a tough spot. They might feel they have the right to withdraw, especially if the surrogate violated agreed-upon terms (like not using substances during pregnancy). However, terminating a pregnancy because of the child's potential disabilities could be seen as discriminatory. But the couple's decision is also about their ability to cope and provide care. \n\nConsidering the surrogate's actions as a breach of trust might justify the couple's hesitation. But the decision to not accept the child could still be controversial. The answer might depend on cultural or legal norms, but since the user is asking for a moral judgment, it's a balance between the couple's rights and the child's welfare.\n\nI think the answer leans towards not being in the wrong because they're making a hard decision based on new information and the surrogate's actions. But there's a gray area. The correct answer here is B for No.\n"
