It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering refusing an unborn child via surrogacy after finding out about potential disabilities and the surrogate's drug use. \n\nFirst, the context: the couple tried for years to conceive, their wife has medical issues, so they used a surrogate. Surrogacy is illegal for profit there, so it's altruistic. Now, the surrogate is 5 months pregnant. Amniocentesis shows possible Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate also admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole (WIBTA) for not wanting the baby anymore. They mention that having a child with such conditions would change their lives to caregivers, which they aren't ready for. Also, they feel upset about the surrogate \"toying with a life.\"\n\nI need to evaluate if their decision is morally wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the couple's right to make decisions about their family is a factor. They may feel unprepared for the lifelong commitment of caring for a child with significant needs. Surrogacy agreements, even if altruistic, might not cover such scenarios. The surrogate's actions (drugs and alcohol) could affect the child's health, which adds another layer.\n\nBut on the other hand, the child is biologically theirs, so they have a responsibility. Terminating the pregnancy might be seen as abandoning a potential life. The surrogate's actions were harmful, but the couple's options might be limited. Also, the couple is in a stressful situation, dealing with unexpected outcomes.\n\nThe surrogate's health issues during pregnancy complicate things. If the couple terminates, what happens to the surrogate? Are there legal repercussions? The author hasn't reported it yet, so they might be considering the surrogate's well-being too.\n\nEthically, this is tricky. Some might say it's their right to decide not to proceed, especially given the circumstances. Others might argue that life is precious and they should accept the child regardless. The surrogate's actions do affect the child's development, which could be a reason to reconsider.\n\nIn terms of the author's feelings of being unprepared, it's valid. They were under the impression that they might have a healthy child. Now facing a different reality, they feel overwhelmed. They might also feel guilt or pressure from societal expectations.\n\nLegally, the answer might depend on the country's surrogacy laws. Since it's illegal for profit, maybe the legal framework isn't clear. If the surrogate violated the agreement by using substances, that could affect the couple's options. But without legal clarity, it's hard to know.\n\nSo, considering all angles: the couple's decision is influenced by medical, emotional, and practical factors. They are in a tough spot. Whether they are in the wrong is subjective. Some might empathize with their fear and unpreparedness, while others might criticize their choice.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because they are dealing with unforeseen circumstances and have a right to make decisions about their family. However, it's a close call. The surrogate's actions do complicate things, but the couple's responsibility to the child is also a factor. Overall, their decision is understandable given the context.\n"
