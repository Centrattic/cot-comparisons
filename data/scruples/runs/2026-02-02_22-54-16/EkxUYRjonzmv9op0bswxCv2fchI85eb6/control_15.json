It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple who used a surrogate because the wife has medical issues that make carrying a pregnancy difficult. They went through a surrogacy process, and now at five months, the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. Plus, the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during the pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The user mentioned that surrogacy for profit is illegal where they are, so it's altruistic. That might affect their legal options. They haven't reported the surrogate's actions yet, so maybe they're unsure about the legal consequences. But the main question is about moral wrongness, not legal.\n\nThe couple is considering refusing the baby after finding out about the health issues. They feel unprepared for the lifelong commitment of caring for a child with these conditions. They also mention being upset that the surrogate \"toyed with a life,\" implying they feel the surrogate was careless.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the couple's right to make decisions about their child, the surrogate's responsibilities, and ethical considerations around terminating a pregnancy based on disabilities. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, people have the right to make choices about their family, even if those choices are difficult. Down syndrome and spina bifida are significant conditions that require lifelong care, and the couple might feel they aren't equipped to handle that. However, some might argue that life with these conditions is still valuable and that the parents should accept the child regardless.\n\nThe surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) could be seen as a breach of her agreement. She's a surrogate, so she's supposed to be carrying a child for the intended parents. Her substance use might have contributed to the baby's conditions, which adds complexity. The couple might feel betrayed, which could influence their decision to not proceed.\n\nBut is the couple in the wrong for wanting to refuse the baby? Well, they made a commitment to have a child through surrogacy, knowing the risks of pregnancy, but maybe they didn't anticipate these specific issues. They might have a right to reconsider given the new information and the surrogate's actions. However, some might argue that once the pregnancy is underway, they have a responsibility to carry it to term, especially if the surrogate is carrying their biological child.\n\nAlso, the question of what happens to the child if they refuse it is important. If they terminate, the child wouldn't survive at five months. If born, the child might have significant health issues. But the couple is not in a position to decide the child's fate based on their own readiness. That's a heavy ethical point.\n\nIn terms of the surrogate, if she broke her agreement by using substances, the couple might have legal recourse, but the moral blame here is shared. The surrogate's actions could have harmed the child, but the couple's decision to proceed with surrogacy without knowing her history might also be a factor.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the couple's decision is considered self-centered or a legitimate choice based on their capacity to care for the child. Different perspectives would weigh in here. Some might say that the couple is being realistic and responsible, while others might see it as abandoning their commitment. However, given the surrogate's role and the unexpected circumstances, the author might not be entirely at fault. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to be careful here.\n"
