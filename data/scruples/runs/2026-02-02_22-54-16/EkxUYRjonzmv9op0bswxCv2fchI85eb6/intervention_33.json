It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering refusing the baby. The situation involves surrogacy, where the surrogate was supposed to be altruistic but admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy. The parents found out there's a high chance the baby has Down syndrome and spina bifida, and they're considering not accepting the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Surrogacy laws can vary, but since it's altruistic, there might be different considerations than commercial surrogacy. The parents might be under some legal obligation to accept the child once the pregnancy is confirmed, especially if they've already gone through the process and the surrogate is in her second trimester. Legally, can they terminate the pregnancy now? That's a key point. If they can't, then they might not have a legal option to refuse the baby, but the ethical question remains.\n\nEthically, the parents are concerned about the child's quality of life and their own ability to care for a child with such conditions. They also feel the surrogate compromised the pregnancy with her actions. But is it their responsibility to accept the child despite the risks? Surrogacy agreements typically require the surrogate to carry the pregnancy to term unless there's a medical reason to terminate. If the surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) contributed to the child's conditions, that complicates things. They might have grounds to question the surrogate's compliance with the agreed terms, which could affect the legal standing of the surrogacy contract.\n\nThe parents also mention they didn't want to be caregivers for life and aren't ready. That's a personal choice, but does that make them the \"assholes\"? It's a tough situation. They might be acting out of self-preservation and realistic expectations about their capabilities. However, some might argue that bringing a child into the world with potential disabilities is a responsibility they should accept, especially since the child is biologically theirs. But the surrogate's behavior might shift blame. If she broke the terms by using harmful substances, could that make her the one at fault?\n\nAlso, considering the emotional and financial investment the parents have made over years, it's understandable they're overwhelmed. They might feel they can't back out now, but if they proceed, they're stuck with a child they're not prepared for. The surrogate's actions could open the door for legal action against her, which might be a path for the parents to explore instead of being blamed for not wanting the child.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, it's complex. The parents might not be in the wrong if the surrogate's actions were a breach of the agreement, but if the agreement didn't cover such behaviors, they might be left without legal recourse. The ethical dilemma here is balancing the parents' rights and preparedness against the child's right to parents. However, since the child's existence is already a fact, the parents' decision to proceed or not has significant consequences.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the parents are facing unexpected circumstances due to the surrogate's actions and their own unpreparedness. The surrogate's breach might be the more significant issue here. However, there's a counterargument that once the pregnancy is underway, they have responsibilities regardless of the conditions. But given the context, B seems plausible.\n"
