It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves a surrogacy arrangement where the surrogate was smoking and drinking during pregnancy, and the parents-to-be are now considering not accepting the baby due to the high risk of Down syndrome and spina bifida.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects here. The key points are: the surrogacy is altruistic, the surrogate broke the terms by using substances, and the parents are rethinking their decision based on the baby's potential health issues. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the surrogacy contract was properly established, there might be clauses that address the surrogate's behavior during pregnancy. If the agency is involved and the surrogate violated the terms, there could be consequences. However, the parents might have the right to reconsider their commitment if the surrogate breached the agreement. But I'm not sure about the specific laws in their country, which the user mentioned as \"surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic.\" That might affect the legal recourse available.\n\nEthically, the parents are facing a difficult decision. They were prepared to parent a child but now are overwhelmed by the potential challenges of raising a child with significant health needs. The surrogate's actions also add a layer of complexity\u2014her behavior could have impacted the baby's health. The parents might feel betrayed that the surrogate didn't take proper care of the pregnancy, which could influence their decision to proceed.\n\nHowever, terminating the pregnancy at five months might not be an option anymore, depending on the gestational age and local laws. If the baby is being born, the parents have to consider their readiness for the long-term care required. It's important to note that the parents are honest about their feelings and are not dismissing the child based on disability but rather the lifestyle change it would bring. The surrogate's actions are a significant factor here, as she was entrusted with carrying the child and failed to adhere to the agreed-upon terms.\n\nThe parents might not be in the wrong if the surrogate breached the surrogacy agreement by using substances. In such cases, the intended parents could have legal grounds to distance themselves from the pregnancy. However, they also have a moral responsibility once the child is born. The answer might depend on the specific terms of the surrogacy contract and whether there were explicit agreements about substance use.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, people might have different views. Some might see the parents as selfish for not wanting the child, while others might empathize with their situation, especially given the surrogate's actions. The parents are also dealing with unexpected challenges that they hadn't prepared for, which is a valid concern.\n\nSo, putting it all together, if the surrogacy contract allows the parents to terminate the arrangement due to the surrogate's misconduct, then the parents might not be in the wrong. However, if the child is already on the way, they might still have a responsibility to care for the child unless there are legal options to relinquish parental rights. The key here is the legality and the terms of the surrogacy agreement. If the surrogate violated the terms, the parents could be justified in their decision, but if they proceed, they need to be prepared to take on the role of caregivers.\n"
