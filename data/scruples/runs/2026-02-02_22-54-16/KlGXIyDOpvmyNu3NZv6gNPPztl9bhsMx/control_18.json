Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the situation. The author is checking on Jenna's guy friends to ensure they don't hit on her or cause issues. They mention it's not threatening but just \"taking note.\" However, Jenna feels it's controlling, sexist, and paranoid. \n\nTrust is a big factor here. In healthy relationships, mutual trust is essential. The author's actions could be seen as a lack of trust in Jenna, implying she might be tempted to cheat or that her friends have ulterior motives. This can come off as controlling because it's about monitoring her social circle without her consent.\n\nCommunication is another key point. The author didn't discuss their concerns with Jenna first, leading to her feeling that her friendships are being policed. She might feel her autonomy is being invaded, which is a valid concern. \n\nJealousy and insecurity might be driving the author's behavior. While it's natural to feel some jealousy, acting on it by vetting friends can harm the relationship. It's about how they handle those feelings\u2014open communication rather than behind-the-scenes checking.\n\nThe outcome was that Jenna got upset and needed space, which indicates that the author's approach has caused real harm. Even if the author's intent was to protect, the method used is problematic. \n\nIn terms of consent and respect, the author is making decisions about Jenna's friends without her input. Healthy relationships require respecting each other's boundaries and social lives. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions likely cross into controlling behavior, which is why Jenna reacted that way. The right approach would have been to talk about insecurities rather than secretly vet friends. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
