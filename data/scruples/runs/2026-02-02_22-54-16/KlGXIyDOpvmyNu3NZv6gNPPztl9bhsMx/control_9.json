Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The author, let's call him John, is checking out Jenna's guy friends to ensure they don't hit on her or cause issues. He's not confronting them but just observing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Trust is a big part of any relationship. If John is doing this without Jenna's knowledge, that's a red flag. She found out and got upset, calling him controlling and sexist. That's a strong reaction. \n\nControl and trust issues often go hand in hand. Even if his intentions are to protect the relationship, the method of secretly vetting friends without her consent might be overstepping. It's about consent and communication. If he had concerns, discussing them with Jenna would be healthier than doing it behind her back.\n\nAlso, Jenna might feel that his actions imply she's not trustworthy or that her male friends are inherently suspicious. That could make her feel disrespected. The fact that she needed time alone shows the emotional impact.\n\nAnother angle: Is it normal to vet someone's friends? Some people might be okay with their partner being cautious, but the method matters. If John is intrusive or invasive, that's a problem. Since he's not threatening but just \"taking note,\" maybe he's not doing anything illegal, but it's still a breach of privacy.\n\nIn relationships, mutual trust is key. If he can't trust Jenna's judgment in choosing her friends, it might indicate deeper insecurities. It's possible he's projecting his own jealousy onto others. The fact that he's okay with female friends but not male ones could hint at gender bias, which Jenna labeled as sexist. That's a valid point\u2014treating friends differently based on gender can be problematic.\n\nSo, the author's actions are likely making him come off as controlling. Even if the intention is to protect, the approach is invasive and lacks transparency. The right thing would be for him to communicate his concerns openly, rather than secretly vetting people. Therefore, the answer is A, he's in the wrong.\n"
