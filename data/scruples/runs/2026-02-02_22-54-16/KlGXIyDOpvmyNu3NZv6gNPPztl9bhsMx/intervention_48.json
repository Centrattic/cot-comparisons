Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is in a relationship with Jenna, and they've been together for 8 months. He mentions that Jenna has male friends and he doesn't trust them. He says he checks out her male friends to see what their intentions are, to make sure they don't hit on her or lead her to cheat. He's not threatening, just taking note. But Jenna got angry, called him sexist, controlling, paranoid, and needed some time alone. Now he's wondering if he's an asshole for doing this.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics of the relationship. Trust is a big part of any relationship. If he doesn't trust her male friends, that could indicate underlying issues. Checking people out could be seen as an invasion of privacy. Even if his intention is to protect her, the method of \"vetting\" might be controlling. \n\nHe mentions he's not threatening but taking note. That sounds like he's monitoring her friends without her knowledge. That could be problematic because it's not transparent. He's making assumptions about her friends' intentions, which might not be accurate. His actions have made Jenna feel that he's controlling and sexist because he's focusing on her male friends and possibly doubting her judgment in choosing friends.\n\nJenna's reaction is valid because being in a relationship doesn't mean you get to control the other person's social circle. Trust issues can exist, but acting on them without communication can damage the relationship. The author might be projecting his own insecurities onto Jenna's friends. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's doing this vetting without her knowledge or consent could be seen as a breach of trust. Healthy relationships require communication and mutual respect. If he had concerns, he should have talked to Jenna first instead of secretly vetting her friends. \n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, the key points are invasion of privacy, lack of communication, and controlling behavior. Even if his intentions are good, the method is problematic. So the answer is likely A (he is in the wrong).\n"
