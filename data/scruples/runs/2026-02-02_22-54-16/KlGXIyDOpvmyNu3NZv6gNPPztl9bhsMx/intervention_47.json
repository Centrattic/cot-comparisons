Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The author justifies it by saying they don't trust these guys and want to make sure they're not hitting on her or leading her into something. The girlfriend got upset, accusing him of being sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Trust is a big part of a relationship. If one partner is constantly checking up on the other's friends, even if it's just mentally noting their intentions, it can come off as controlling. The key here is whether the author is taking actions that infringe on the girlfriend's autonomy. The author mentions they aren't threatening but just taking note. However, the girlfriend feels her privacy is invaded, which is valid because she's not okay with being monitored like that.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption made by the author. He assumes some of her male friends have romantic intentions without clear evidence. That could be projecting his own insecurities onto her friends. Trust issues can stem from personal insecurities, but acting on those without communication or evidence can damage the relationship. The girlfriend's reaction is a red flag because she felt the need to take time alone, indicating the behavior was harmful.\n\nAlso, the author's justification of wanting to \"make sure they're good guys\" might be a way to rationalize controlling behavior. Healthy relationships involve trust and respecting each other's social circles. The fact that the author's actions led to conflict suggests that the behavior crosses a boundary. The girlfriend's perspective is important here; even if the author's intent is to protect, the method invades her privacy and undermines her trust in him.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions, while coming from a place of concern, are likely making him the asshole because they involve surveillance and lack of trust without the girlfriend's consent. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
