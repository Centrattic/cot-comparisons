Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they don't trust their girlfriend Jenna's male friends. They check out these guys to ensure they don't hit on her or cause issues. The girlfriend got upset, calling him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. The author is questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm, the key points here are trust and boundaries in a relationship. The author's actions\u2014vetting friends\u2014could be seen as overstepping. While it's normal to have concerns about a partner's friends, actively checking up on them without their knowledge might invade the partner's privacy. The girlfriend feeling like he's controlling suggests that his actions are making her feel her autonomy is being restricted.\n\nAlso, the author's justification is that they're ensuring the guys are \"good.\" But in a healthy relationship, trust is foundational. If the author can't trust Jenna's judgment in choosing friends, that might indicate deeper issues in their relationship rather than the friends being problematic. The fact that Jenna is upset and needed space shows that his actions have caused harm to their relationship dynamics.\n\nThe term \"controlling\" is a red flag. Even if the author isn't being overtly threatening, the act of monitoring without consent can be controlling. The girlfriend's right to have friends and privacy is important. The author might need to reflect on why he can't trust Jenna's friends\u2014could it stem from his own insecurities rather than actual threats?\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent might be to protect the relationship, the method is problematic. The answer here would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because his actions breach trust and respect for his partner's autonomy.\n"
