Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author and Jenna have been together for 8 months. He's checking out her male friends because he doesn't trust them, thinking some might have romantic intentions. He's not being threatening but taking note. Jenna found out and got upset, calling him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. Now they're back together, but he's questioning if he's an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is the author's actions of vetting Jenna's male friends. In a relationship, trust is crucial. If he's actively investigating her friends without her knowledge, that could be seen as a violation of trust. Even if his intentions are to protect the relationship, the method might be inappropriate.\n\nThe argument that he's not being threatening but just taking note\u2014maybe he's checking their social media, asking mutual friends about them, or something similar. However, doing this without Jenna's awareness or consent can come off as controlling. Partners usually expect mutual respect and privacy. By secretly vetting her friends, he's making assumptions about her behavior and possibly her character, which can be hurtful.\n\nJenna's reaction is significant. She felt the need to take a few days alone, indicating that his actions caused her distress. When she calls him sexist, that might mean she feels he's judging the male friends based on gender stereotypes. Controlling implies he's trying to exert power over her social life. Paranoid suggests he's acting without a clear reason, which can be unsettling.\n\nThe duration of the relationship is 8 months. In some relationships, being cautious early on might be more common, but after several months, mutual trust is usually expected. If there's no actual evidence of her friends being a problem, his actions could be unnecessary. It's important to distinguish between healthy concern and overstepping boundaries.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning: he doesn't see the need for her to interact with those guys. This could stem from insecurity or fear, but it's not a valid reason to intrude on her friendships. Healthy relationships involve communication. If he has concerns, he should discuss them with Jenna instead of acting unilaterally.\n\nIn terms of ethical judgment, the question is whether his actions are justified. While wanting to protect the relationship is understandable, the method of secretly vetting friends without her consent is problematic. It undermines her trust and autonomy, which are essential in any relationship.\n\nSo, putting this all together: the author's actions, though possibly well-intentioned, are invasive and controlling. Jenna's right to have friends and the privacy of her interactions with them is important. The answer is likely A, meaning the author is in the wrong.\n"
