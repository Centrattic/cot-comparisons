Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The situation is that they've been together 8 months, and he doesn't trust her guy friends, so he checks them out to make sure they aren't hitting on her or leading her to cheat. His GF called him controlling, sexist, paranoid, and sent him away for a couple days. They're back together, but he's still wondering if he was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of trust in a relationship. Trust is a fundamental part of any healthy relationship. If one partner doesn't trust the other's friends, that could indicate issues. But why wouldn't he trust her friends? The post says he's not threatening, just taking note. However, the act of vetting someone's friends without their knowledge or consent can be seen as invasive. \n\nHe mentions that his GF is outgoing and has many friends. It's normal for her to have male friends, but his actions might be overstepping. The key here is consent and communication. Did he talk to her about his concerns before \"vetting\" her friends? If not, that's a problem. It's one thing to have concerns, but acting on them without discussing with her can come off as controlling.\n\nAlso, the fact that she got really upset and needed time alone is a red flag. Her feelings of being controlled and sexist suggest that his actions made her feel disrespected. Healthy relationships involve mutual respect and trust. If he's not trusting her judgment about her friends, it undermines that trust. \n\nHe might be projecting his own paranoia onto the situation. Maybe he's insecure or has past experiences that make him distrustful. However, that doesn't justify his actions. Instead of vetting her friends, he should communicate his feelings and work through them with her. \n\nOn the other hand, he might have good intentions, wanting to protect his partner. But the method of doing so is problematic. Trust shouldn't be based on surveillance or checking up on others without consent. \n\nIn summary, the author's actions likely made his girlfriend feel controlled and disrespected, even if his intentions were to protect. The lack of communication and the invasion of privacy are significant issues here. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
