Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about him \"vetting\" his girlfriend's male friends. He's checking them out to make sure they don't hit on her or cause trouble. His GF got upset, called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nHmm. First, I need to think about boundaries in relationships. Trust is a big part of any relationship. If he's not trusting her friends without clear reasons, that could be controlling. But maybe he has some valid concerns? Like, if there's a friend who's had issues before. But the post says he's just checking them out, not confronting them or restricting her interactions.\n\nWait, the key here is that he's not threatening or acting on it, just observing. But from the GF's perspective, she might feel that he's being intrusive. She's upset because he's judging her friends without her knowledge. Even if his intention is to protect, doing it behind her back could be a breach of trust. Also, the fact that she felt the need to spend time alone suggests the impact on their relationship.\n\nThe question is whether his actions cross a line. In a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. If he's not given her a chance to address any real issues with her friends but instead takes it upon himself to monitor them, that's controlling. Plus, labeling someone as \"paranoid\" or \"controlling\" is a strong accusation, which implies that his actions are overstepping.\n\nSo, even if his intentions are to protect, the method of secretly vetting her friends without discussing it with her first is problematic. Trust and communication are key. He should have talked to her about his concerns instead of taking matters into his own hands. Therefore, the answer would lean towards him being in the wrong. So Answer A.\n"
