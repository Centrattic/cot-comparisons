Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The author mentions that he checks out her guy friends to ensure they don't hit on her or cause trouble. His girlfriend is upset, calling him sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nHmm. From a relationship advice perspective, trust is key. If the author is checking on his girlfriend's friends without her knowledge, that's probably a problem. Even if his intentions are good, it's an invasion of privacy. Partners should communicate their concerns rather than acting on them secretly. The girlfriend has a right to privacy, and the author's actions might be seen as controlling. Also, assuming the worst about her friends could create unnecessary tension. The fact that the girlfriend feels the need to spend time alone suggests the action hurt her feelings. So even if the author's motives are to protect, the method is problematic. The answer is likely A.\n"
