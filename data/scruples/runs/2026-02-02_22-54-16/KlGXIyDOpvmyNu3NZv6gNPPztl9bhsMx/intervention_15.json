Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The author explains that he checks out her male friends to ensure they aren't trying to hit on her or cause problems. His girlfriend is upset, calling him sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of trust in a relationship. Trust is fundamental, and actions that undermine that trust can be problematic. The author's actions involve investigating his girlfriend's friends without her knowledge, which can be seen as a breach of trust. Even if his intentions are protective, doing this without her consent might be invasive.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is important. Feeling that her partner is spying on her friends could make her feel controlled or mistrusted. The terms she used\u2014controlling and paranoid\u2014suggest she feels her autonomy is being invaded. The author might believe he's being cautious, but the method of doing so without transparency can damage the relationship.\n\nI should also think about cultural and social norms. Some people might see checking on a partner's friends as normal, while others view it as possessive. The key issue here is the lack of communication. If the author had discussed his concerns with Jenna, there might have been a mutual understanding. However, acting unilaterally without her input is likely to cause resentment.\n\nMoreover, the outcome of the argument led to Jenna needing space, indicating that the author's actions caused significant distress. Even if the relationship was resolved afterward, the underlying issue of trust isn't addressed. The question is whether his actions were justified. In healthy relationships, open communication is better than covert actions. The author's approach might be well-intentioned, but the method is problematic.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions are likely to be seen as controlling, even if not malicious. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
