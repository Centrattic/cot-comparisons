Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The user's question is whether the author is an asshole for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and his girlfriend have been together 8 months. He doesn't trust her male friends and checks them out to ensure they don't hit on her or lead her to cheat. The girlfriend got angry, calling him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. The author isn't threatening but just taking notes. He's okay with her female friends but not the guys. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about trust and boundaries in a relationship. The author is monitoring his girlfriend's male friends, which might be seen as controlling behavior. Even if his intentions are good, the act of vetting someone else's friends without their knowledge or consent can be problematic. \n\nIn healthy relationships, trust is essential. If someone feels the need to constantly check on their partner's friends, it might stem from insecurity or lack of trust. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she might feel her privacy is invaded. Even if the author isn't being threatening, the act of secretly vetting her friends could be seen as overstepping boundaries. \n\nControl and jealousy can be signs of an unhealthy relationship. While it's natural to have some concern about partners interacting with others, the method of addressing it matters. Open communication is key. Instead of vetting, having an honest talk about concerns might be better. The author's actions might make the girlfriend feel that her autonomy is not respected. \n\nAlso, the time frame of the relationship (8 months) could be a factor. If the relationship is new, the author's lack of trust might indicate a red flag. It's important that both partners feel respected and not monitored. The girlfriend's feelings of being called sexist and controlling suggest that her boundaries were crossed, which is a valid response.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions likely cross into controlling behavior, even if his intentions are to protect the relationship. Therefore, the answer would be that he's in the wrong.\n"
