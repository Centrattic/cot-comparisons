Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for \"vetting\" their girlfriend's male friends. The author checks out her guy friends to make sure they aren't trying to hit on her or cause trouble. The girlfriend got upset, calling him sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author's intention is to protect their relationship by ensuring the friends are trustworthy. But the girlfriend felt it was an invasion of privacy and controlling behavior. \n\nTrust and autonomy are key here. In a healthy relationship, mutual trust is essential. The author's actions could be seen as a lack of trust in his girlfriend, implying she might not choose good friends or that he can't trust her to handle her friendships. This might make him seem controlling. On the other hand, some people might argue that being cautious, especially in a new relationship, is normal. However, the method he's using\u2014checking up on her friends without her knowledge\u2014could be problematic. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction points out issues with his approach. She might feel that her social life is being monitored, which can be a red flag in relationships. The term \"sexist\" might come from the idea that he's treating her friends differently based on gender, not considering that she's an adult who can manage her own interactions. \n\nAlso, the duration of the relationship is 8 months. Some level of insecurity is normal, but if it's leading to behaviors that invade her privacy, it's a problem. The key is whether his actions are respectful of her autonomy. Since he's \"vetting\" without her consent, it's likely overstepping. \n\nIn conclusion, while his intentions might stem from wanting to protect the relationship, the method is controlling and lacks trust. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
