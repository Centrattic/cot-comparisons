Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The person is checking out their girlfriend's male friends to ensure they aren't hitting on her or causing issues. They mention it's not about being threatening but rather taking note. However, the girlfriend found out and is upset, calling them sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, trust is crucial. Partners should feel secure without needing to monitor each other's friends. While the author's intentions might be to protect the relationship, the method of \"vetting\" without discussing it with the girlfriend could be seen as invasive. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that this behavior made her feel her autonomy was being questioned, which can lead to trust issues on her side.\n\nControl and trust are key here. Even if the author isn't being overtly threatening, the act of secretly vetting friends can be perceived as controlling. Healthy relationships involve communication and mutual trust. If the author is constantly distrustful of the girlfriend's friends, that might indicate deeper insecurities or issues in the relationship that need addressing through dialogue rather than surveillance.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is important. Feeling that her male friends are under scrutiny might make her feel like her social circle is being policed, which can be damaging. The labels of \"sexist\" and \"controlling\" imply that the author's actions are discriminatory or oppressive, which can be detrimental to the relationship dynamics.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't using aggressive tactics, just observation. But the line between healthy caution and controlling behavior can be thin. The key question is whether the author discussed these concerns with the girlfriend. If they didn't, it's a problem because it's not about their own feelings but how their actions affect the partner.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have had good intentions, the method of handling the situation without communication and the resulting harm to the girlfriend's feelings likely makes them the asshole. The answer is A.\n"
