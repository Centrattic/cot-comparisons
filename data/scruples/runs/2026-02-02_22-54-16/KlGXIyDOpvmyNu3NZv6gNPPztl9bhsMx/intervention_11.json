Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The author is checking out Jenna's guy friends to ensure they have good intentions and aren't after her romantically. They admit they don't trust these friends and are keeping an eye on them, which led to an argument where Jenna accused them of being sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's actions involve monitoring their girlfriend's interactions with others. While it's common to have some level of concern, the key issue here is the method used. Vetting friends without the girlfriend's knowledge might cross into controlling behavior. Trust is a fundamental part of a relationship, and if the author is constantly questioning Jenna's friends based on assumptions, that could erode trust.\n\nThe author mentions they are \"not threatening\" but just taking notes. However, even passive observation without open communication can be problematic. It's important to address concerns through discussion rather than unilateral actions. Jenna's reaction indicates that she feels her autonomy is being invaded, which is a valid concern. Being called controlling and paranoid suggests that the author's behavior might be perceived as overstepping boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the author argues they have a valid concern about their partner's safety and fidelity. It's natural to want to protect one's partner, but the approach here might be unhealthy. The line between protective and controlling can be thin, and the key is mutual respect and communication. Since the author didn't discuss their concerns with Jenna and instead took matters into their own hands, it's more likely that their actions contributed to the conflict.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to build trust through open dialogue. If there are genuine concerns, discussing them with the partner is better than covertly monitoring. The fact that Jenna wanted time alone indicates the impact of these actions on their relationship. The author's behavior, while stemming from a place of concern, lacks transparency and mutual agreement, which are essential for a healthy partnership.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's actions are likely seen as controlling and invasive, making them in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
