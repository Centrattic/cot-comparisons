Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the scenario) is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author, let's call him Alex, is in an 8-month relationship with Jenna. He doesn't trust her male friends because he thinks some might have romantic intentions. He checks them out to make sure they don't try to hit on her or cause trouble. Jenna found out, got upset, called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid, and needed space. Now, he's questioning if he's an asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are trust, control, and consent in a relationship. The author is monitoring Jenna's friends without her knowledge. Even if his intentions are to protect the relationship, the method he's using\u2014spying or vetting without her knowledge\u2014could be seen as invasive. \n\nTrust is a fundamental part of any relationship. By not trusting Jenna's judgment of her friends, he might be undermining her autonomy. Also, the fact that she felt the need to confront him and took time away suggests that this behavior is a significant issue for her. Control in a relationship should be mutual and consensual, but this seems one-sided. \n\nThe term \"controlling\" often refers to behaviors that restrict a partner's freedom without their consent. If Alex is secretly vetting her friends, that's a form of control she didn't agree to. Even if he isn't threatening, the act of surveillance can be damaging. \n\nOn the other hand, Alex might feel insecure or want to protect the relationship. But healthy relationships involve communication rather than covert actions. Instead of vetting, discussing his concerns with Jenna would be a better approach. \n\nSo, putting this together, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong. The key factors are lack of trust, unilateral decision-making, and the negative impact on Jenna's feelings. The answer is A.\n"
