Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The situation is that he's been checking up on her guy friends to make sure they don't hit on her or do something else. He's not threatening, just taking notes. His GF got upset and called him sexist, controlling, paranoid. Now he's wondering if he's an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's considered healthy in a relationship. Trust is a big part of any relationship. If one partner is constantly checking the other's friends, especially of the opposite sex, that could be seen as controlling. But the author's reasoning is that he doesn't trust these guys and wants to ensure they're not a threat. He's not confronting them, just observing. \n\nBut then, how does one define \"vetting\"? If he's secretly checking up on them without her knowledge, that's a problem. The post mentions he's been taking note of them, so maybe he's not sharing his concerns openly with her. In a healthy relationship, communication is key. Instead of vetting behind her back, he should be talking to her about his insecurities. By doing the vetting himself, he's not addressing the root issue of trust between him and his girlfriend.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction is important. She feels that his actions are sexist and controlling. That suggests she perceives a lack of trust in her, which can be hurtful. If he doesn't trust her judgment about her friends, that could be a sign of deeper issues in the relationship. The fact that she needed time alone shows that his actions caused her distress. \n\nAnother angle is whether his actions are justified. If there's no evidence of the guys being a problem, his suspicions might be unfounded. Trust issues can stem from personal insecurities, but projecting that onto others without cause can be problematic. Even if his intentions are good, the method might be crossing a line. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's actions, while coming from a place of wanting to protect the relationship, likely infringe on his girlfriend's autonomy and trust. Healthy relationships require mutual trust and open communication. By secretly vetting her friends, he's not addressing his own trust issues constructively and is instead taking matters into his own hands, which can be seen as controlling. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
