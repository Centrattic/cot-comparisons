Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. So the situation is that the guy doesn't trust Jenna's guy friends, checks them out, and that led to an argument where Jenna felt he was controlling and sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the actions. The author is \"vetting\" his girlfriend's male friends, which means he's checking them out to see if they have bad intentions. He's not doing it in a confrontational way but just taking notes. The key points here are trust, boundaries, and communication in a relationship.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, trust is essential. If someone is constantly checking their partner's friends without their knowledge, that can be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the intention is to protect, the method might be problematic. The girlfriend found out and felt that the vetting was controlling. The fact that she was upset and took time away shows that this action hurt her feelings and made her feel mistrusted.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he doesn't trust these guys and wants to ensure they don't hit on her or cause issues. But in relationships, it's important to communicate concerns rather than act on them secretly. By \"vetting\" without discussing it with Jenna first, he might have overstepped. It's possible she didn't realize how much he was doing until she got angry, which indicates a lack of communication.\n\nAnother angle is that the author is projecting his own insecurities. If he doesn't trust her friends, maybe he should reflect on why that is. Is it jealousy, past experiences, or something else? The girlfriend's response about being sexist and controlling points out that his actions could be based on stereotypes about men wanting to cheat, which is a form of sexism.\n\nAlso, the author mentions he's okay with her having female friends but not male ones. That could imply a double standard, expecting male friends to have bad intentions without evidence. True trust would involve believing that both genders can be good friends without ulterior motives.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid. Feeling monitored or controlled can damage a relationship. Even if the intention is to protect, the effect is controlling behavior. The fact that she needed time alone shows the impact of his actions. After she returned, things were calm, but the underlying issue remains.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions, while stemming from concern, cross into controlling behavior without open communication. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his actions lack transparency, foster mistrust, and impose his views without considering his partner's feelings.\n"
