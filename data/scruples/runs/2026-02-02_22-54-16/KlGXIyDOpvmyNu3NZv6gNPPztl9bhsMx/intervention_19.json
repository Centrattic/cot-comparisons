Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The author explains that they don't trust the guys, check them out to make sure they aren't hitting on her, and that this led to an argument where the girlfriend called them sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is monitoring their girlfriend's male friends without her knowledge. Even if their intention is to protect the relationship, doing so without her consent could be seen as a violation of trust. In healthy relationships, open communication is key. Instead of secretly vetting her friends, the author might have discussed their concerns with her.\n\nThe girlfriend felt that the author was controlling and paranoid. That's a strong reaction. If someone is checking up on their partner's friends without their knowledge, it can come off as controlling. The act of \"vetting\" implies a level of surveillance that the partner isn't comfortable with. Even if the author isn't threatening, the action itself can be invasive.\n\nTrust is a two-way street. The author might not trust the friends, but by not involving the girlfriend in the conversation, they're not building mutual trust. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that she values her independence and privacy. Being cut off for a couple of days is a significant consequence, indicating the level of hurt this caused her.\n\nI also wonder if the author's actions are based on insecurity or past experiences. Without knowing the full context, it's hard to say, but in relationships, it's important to address insecurities through communication rather than unilateral actions. The author might think they're being proactive, but it's possible they're overstepping boundaries.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, people often frown upon controlling behavior, even if the intent is to prevent cheating. The line between being protective and controlling can be thin. The author's justification that they are \"just taking note\" doesn't mitigate the controlling aspect if done without consent.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's actions, while stemming from a place of wanting to protect the relationship, are likely crossing into controlling territory by not being transparent and respecting the girlfriend's autonomy. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
