Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The situation is that they've been together 8 months, and the author doesn't trust the guy friends, checking them out to make sure they don't hit on her or cause problems. The girlfriend got upset, called him sexist, controlling, paranoid, and needed some space. Now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Trust is a big part of any relationship, right? If one partner is constantly vetting the other's friends, that could be seen as a breach of trust. The author mentions they're not threatening but just taking note. But how is he doing that? If he's checking social media, maybe, but if he's confronting her friends or spreading rumors, that's different.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is important. She's upset and used strong terms. Being called controlling might mean she feels her autonomy is being questioned. Even if his intentions are to protect, the method of vetting without her knowledge could be invasive. Privacy is a factor here. How much is he invading her privacy? If he's just observing from afar, maybe, but if he's actively investigating, that's an issue.\n\nAlso, 8 months into the relationship, is it normal to still have such distrust? Maybe there's an underlying insecurity or past issues. But in a healthy relationship, open communication is key. Instead of vetting, maybe discussing his concerns with her would have been better. He didn't mention talking to her about this; he just took action. That could have caused her to feel disrespected or not trusted.\n\nThe argument that he's \"just making sure\" could be a red flag. It's possible that his actions, even if not overtly controlling, make her feel that her friendships are under scrutiny, which can lead to resentment. The fact that she needed space suggests that his behavior was hurtful.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A. He's in the wrong because his actions are controlling and invasive, and they violated her trust and privacy. Even if his intentions are good, the method is problematic. Relationships require mutual trust and respect, and vetting her friends without her consent crosses a boundary.\n"
