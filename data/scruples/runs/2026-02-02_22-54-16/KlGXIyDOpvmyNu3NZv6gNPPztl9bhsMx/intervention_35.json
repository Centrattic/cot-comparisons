Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The scenario is that the author doesn't trust these guys, thinks some might be interested in the girlfriend romantically, and checks them out to ensure they're not a threat. The girlfriend got upset, calling him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Trust is a big part of any relationship. The author's actions could be seen as a breach of trust because he's investigating her friends without her knowledge. Even if his intentions are to protect, the method of doing so without transparency could be problematic. Partners should communicate their concerns rather than taking it upon themselves to investigate.\n\nThe girlfriend's reactions are also valid. Feeling that her partner is checking up on her friends without her input can feel controlling. It might indicate a lack of trust in the relationship, which can cause resentment. The term \"sexist\" might be a stretch, but if the author isn't doing the same for her female friends, that could be an issue. However, the main point is the lack of communication and consent in his actions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel insecure about his relationship and wants to ensure his girlfriend isn't in a compromising situation. But the right approach would be to discuss these feelings with her instead of acting on his own. The fact that the girlfriend needed space suggests that the method hurt the relationship, even if the intent was to protect.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions might be from a place of wanting to protect, the execution is where he went wrong. Trust and communication are foundational, and his actions undermined both. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
