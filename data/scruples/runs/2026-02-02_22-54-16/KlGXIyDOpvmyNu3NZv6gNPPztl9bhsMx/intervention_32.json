Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The author, let's call him John, is in an 8-month relationship with Jenna. He mentions he doesn't trust her male friends because he believes some may have romantic intentions. He checks them out to ensure they don't hit on her or lead her to cheat.\n\nHe says he's not threatening, just taking notes. Jenna got upset, called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid, and needed alone time. Now he's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. In healthy relationships, trust is a key component. John's actions might stem from insecurity or a lack of trust, which is his personal issue. However, the act of vetting someone's friends, especially without their knowledge, can be seen as invasive and controlling. It's one thing to have concerns, but acting on them by investigating others' intentions without the partner's awareness could breach trust.\n\nJenna's reaction is important. She felt that his actions were controlling and paranoid. Feeling the need to check on her friends suggests he doesn't trust her judgment or their relationship. This could lead to more issues in the long run, like eroded trust and constant surveillance.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's doing this secretly adds to the problem. Open communication is crucial. If he had concerns, discussing them with Jenna would be better than acting unilaterally. His approach might make her feel that he doesn't trust her, even if his intentions are to protect her.\n\nFrom a relationship advice perspective, controlling behavior is typically discouraged. It's about mutual respect and trust. Even if he believes his actions are protective, they can come off as possessive and controlling, which can strain the relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while his intentions might be to protect the relationship, the method he's using is problematic. The answer is likely A, meaning he's in the wrong because his actions are controlling and undermine trust.\n"
