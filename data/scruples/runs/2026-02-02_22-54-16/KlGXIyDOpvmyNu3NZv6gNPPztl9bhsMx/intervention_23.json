Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The question is whether the author's actions are justified or if they're being controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author has been checking out their girlfriend Jenna's male friends to ensure they're not a threat to the relationship. They mention not threatening them but just keeping an eye out. The girlfriend got upset, called them sexist and controlling, took time off, and then returned.\n\nNow, from a relationship advice perspective, trust is a key component. Jealousy or checking up on a partner's friends can be a red flag. The author's actions might come off as invasive or controlling, even if the intention is to protect the relationship. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that she felt her privacy was invaded and that her male friends weren't being given the benefit of the doubt. \n\nIn many relationships, it's important to respect each other's boundaries. If the author is \"vetting\" without Jenna's knowledge, that's likely a problem. Trust should be mutual. Also, the assumption that Jenna's male friends might have ulterior motives could be based on insecurity or past experiences, but acting on that without communication can strain the relationship.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong if they discussed their concerns openly and both agreed on the need for vetting. But since it seems the author did this secretly, it's more about controlling behavior. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she might feel her autonomy is being questioned. \n\nIn terms of cultural perspectives, some might argue that checking friends is normal, but in modern relationship standards, transparency and mutual trust are emphasized. The term \"controlling\" is often used when one partner exerts power over the other's social interactions without consent.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's actions are likely seen as controlling and a breach of trust. Even if the intention is good, the method of acting without the partner's knowledge and causing distress makes the author at fault. The right approach would be open communication about insecurities rather than surveillance.\n"
