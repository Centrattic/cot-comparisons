Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The main issue is that the author is checking out his girlfriend's male friends to ensure they aren't a threat to the relationship. He mentions he's not threatening but just taking notes. The girlfriend reacted negatively, calling him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. \n\nSo, what's the key factors here? Trust in a relationship is crucial. Generally, trust is supposed to be a foundational element. If someone is constantly vetting their partner's friends, that can be seen as a lack of trust, which might be controlling behavior. However, the author's intent is to protect the relationship, which he perceives as necessary because he doesn't trust the guy friends. \n\nBut wait, why doesn't he trust them? He says there's at least one guy who probably wants her. Jealousy is a natural emotion, but acting on it by vetting could cross a line. The girlfriend felt that his actions were controlling. In healthy relationships, partners should respect each other's boundaries and friends. \n\nAlso, the author didn't mention discussing this with his girlfriend. Instead, he took it upon himself to check them out. Open communication is key in relationships. If there were concerns, talking about them together would be more appropriate than doing surveillance. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction\u2014needing time alone\u2014shows that the vetting caused harm to their relationship. The fact that the author still isn't sure if he's in the wrong suggests he might not see the issue as controlling. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions are likely seen as controlling and lacking trust. The answer would lean towards AITA (A for the author being in the wrong). The key points are breach of trust, lack of communication, and controlling behavior.\n"
