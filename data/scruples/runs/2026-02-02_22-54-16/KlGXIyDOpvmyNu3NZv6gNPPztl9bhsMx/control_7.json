Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is checking out his girlfriend Jenna's male friends because he doesn't trust them. He mentions that he's not threatening, just taking note to ensure they don't hit on her or cause trouble. However, Jenna feels he's sexist, controlling, and paranoid, leading to an argument and her needing space.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of trust in a relationship. Trust is fundamental. If the author is doing this without Jenna's consent, it might be seen as invasive. Even if his intentions are to protect, the method of secretly vetting friends can come off as controlling. He's making assumptions about the intentions of her friends, which might not be fair. Also, the fact that Jenna is upset about this suggests that his actions are causing harm to their relationship.\n\nAnother angle: communication. The author didn't discuss this with Jenna. Instead of addressing his concerns openly, he took it upon himself to investigate. Healthy relationships require open dialogue. If he had his concerns about her friends, he should have talked to her about it rather than doing it behind the scenes. His actions might be perceived as a breach of privacy and respect for her autonomy.\n\nThe term \"controlling\" is something Jenna used. If he's monitoring her friends and their interactions, that's a form of control. It's about power and trust. His lack of trust might stem from insecurity, but acting on it without her knowledge crosses a line. The fact that she labeled him as sexist and controlling implies that his behavior is not accepted in their relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might be to protect, the method and lack of communication make his actions problematic. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because his actions undermine trust and respect. So, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
