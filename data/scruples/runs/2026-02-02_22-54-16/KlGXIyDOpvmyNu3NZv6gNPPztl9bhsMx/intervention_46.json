Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The author explains that they don't trust the guys, check them out to make sure they're not hitting on her or causing issues. The girlfriend got upset, calling him sexist, controlling, paranoid.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are trust, control, and communication. The author is checking out his girlfriend's friends without her knowledge. Even if he's not being overtly threatening, the act of doing so without discussing it with her might be an issue. \n\nIn relationships, trust is usually a two-way street. If the author is feeling insecure, maybe that's a personal issue he should address rather than acting on it by vetting others. Also, the method of doing this \"checking out\" isn't specified, but it could involve snooping, asking friends, or other invasive actions. That can breach the girlfriend's privacy and autonomy. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid. Feeling monitored or controlled can be really hurtful. The fact that she needed time alone shows she felt disrespected. Even if his intentions are to protect, the approach might be controlling. Healthy relationships require open communication. If he had concerns, discussing them with her directly would be better than taking matters into his own hands. \n\nSo, while the author's insecurity might be understandable, the action of vetting without consent crosses into controlling behavior. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
