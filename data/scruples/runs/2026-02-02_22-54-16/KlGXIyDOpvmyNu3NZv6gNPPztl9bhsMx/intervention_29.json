Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The user, let's call him \"Alex,\" is in a relationship with Jenna for 8 months. He doesn't trust her male friends because he thinks some of them might have romantic intentions. He checks them out to make sure they don't hit on her or lead her into cheating. Jenna got upset, called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid, and needed some space. Now Alex is wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the concept of trust in a relationship. Trust is fundamental. If one partner is constantly questioning the other's friends, especially male friends, it might indicate a lack of trust in the relationship. Trust issues can stem from past experiences or insecurity, but acting on those insecurities without the partner's knowledge can be problematic.\n\nThe term \"controlling\" is thrown around here. Controlling behavior often involves trying to manage or limit a partner's social interactions. While Alex says he's not threatening but just taking note, the act of vetting without Jenna's knowledge could be seen as controlling. Even if his intentions are good, the method might be intrusive. \n\nJenna's perspective is important. She might feel that her autonomy is being invaded. Having male friends is normal, and if Alex is secretly checking them out, it could make her feel like he doesn't respect her or her social life. The fact that she's upset and asked for space shows that his actions have caused harm to their relationship.\n\nAnother angle: communication. If Alex had concerns, the appropriate step would be to talk to Jenna about his feelings instead of secretly vetting her friends. Open communication could address any trust issues directly, rather than creating a situation where she feels spied on.\n\nThe argument that he's \"just making sure\" might not hold in the eyes of the relationship. Trust is a two-way street. If one partner isn't trusting the other's judgment regarding their friends, it can breed resentment. Plus, it's possible that his actions are based on his own insecurities rather than any actual wrongdoing by Jenna's friends.\n\nI should also think about societal norms. It's common for people to have friends of the opposite sex, and assuming all male friends are a threat is a stereotype. Labeling someone as sexist because he distrusts female friends' male friends might be extreme, but the act of vetting without discussion is where the problem lies.\n\nIn conclusion, while Alex's intentions might be protective, the method he used is invasive and controlling. Trust and communication are key in relationships, and his actions likely breached that trust. Jenna's reaction is valid because her boundaries were crossed. Therefore, the answer is likely that Alex is in the wrong.\n"
