Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The author is checking out her guy friends to make sure they don't hit on her or something. His GF got mad, called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nHmm. So, first, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a relationship that's been going for 8 months. He's checking out her male friends, which sounds like he's not just being curious but actively vetting them. The girlfriend is upset, and he's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nWhat's the key point here? Trust is a big factor in relationships. If he doesn't trust her guy friends, that could be a sign of insecurity or jealousy. But is it okay to check up on them? Maybe it's a line between normal concern and controlling behavior. \n\nThe author mentions he's not threatening, just taking note. But the act of vetting can be seen as controlling. The girlfriend's reaction is valid\u2014feeling that her friends are being judged without her consent. Trust issues are common, but acting on them by investigating others' intentions without discussing it with her might be the problem.\n\nAlso, the author says he's fine with her having lady friends but not guy friends. That could come off as sexist, as he's making a distinction based on gender. The girlfriend feeling alone for a day or two might indicate that his actions caused her emotional distress. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he had concerns, maybe discussing them with her instead of vetting her friends would have been better. His actions might infringe on her privacy and autonomy. So even if his intentions are good, the method is problematic.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are likely making him the asshole here. He's overstepping by vetting her friends without her knowledge, leading to her feeling controlled and disrespected. The answer would be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
