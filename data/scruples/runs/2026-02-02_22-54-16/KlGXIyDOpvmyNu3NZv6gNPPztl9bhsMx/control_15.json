Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The main points are that the author doesn't trust the guy friends, thinks some might want Jenna, and checks them out to prevent hitting on her or cheating. The GF got upset, called him sexist, controlling, paranoid, and needed space.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author's actions are justified. Trust is a big part of relationships, but is it okay to \"vet\" someone's friends? The key here is how the author is doing the vetting. They mention they're not threatening, just taking note. Maybe they're looking up the guy's social media, talking to mutual friends, or something non-invasive. But even that can be seen as intrusive. If Jenna didn't know about this, then it's a secrecy issue. In relationships, transparency is important. If he's doing this without her knowledge, it might be controlling. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they want to ensure the guys aren't up to something. But Jenna has the right to choose her friends, and the author's actions might infringe on her autonomy. Trust is a two-way street. If the author doesn't trust her, that's a problem. Also, assuming that all male friends have ulterior motives could be sexist, as it generalizes men's intentions. \n\nThe GF's reaction makes sense because it's her right to be upset if her partner is secretly judging her friends. The argument that he's just being cautious might not hold if it's done without discussion. Healthy relationships require communication. The author should have talked to Jenna about his concerns instead of doing it behind the scenes. \n\nSo, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because his actions are controlling and lack transparency, even if his intentions are to protect the relationship. Trust and open communication are essential, and vetting without discussing it first can harm the relationship.\n"
