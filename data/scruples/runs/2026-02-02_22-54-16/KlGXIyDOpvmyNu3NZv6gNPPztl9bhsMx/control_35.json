Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The author explains that they've been checking out her guy friends to make sure they don't hit on her or cause trouble. The girlfriend got upset, called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid, but they're still together.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to determine if the author's actions are wrong. The key points here are trust in a relationship and boundaries. The author mentions they don't trust her male friends and want to ensure they aren't a threat. But checking them out without her knowledge might be an issue. The girlfriend felt it's controlling and sexist, which are serious accusations.\n\nIn healthy relationships, trust is fundamental. If the author feels the need to vet others, that might indicate underlying trust issues. Also, by doing this without discussing it with her, he's not respecting her autonomy and the trust she expects in the relationship. The fact that she's upset and needs space shows that his actions caused harm, even if his intentions were to protect.\n\nBeing called controlling and sexist suggests that his actions are seen as overstepping. Controlling behavior often involves trying to manage or restrict a partner's social interactions without their consent. While it's natural to have concerns, the method here is problematic. The line between concern and control is thin here. \n\nThe author might think he's being proactive, but the way he's handling it\u2014without transparency and leading to distrust\u2014could be damaging. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she has the right to socialize with anyone she chooses unless there's a mutual agreement otherwise. His actions, even if not aggressive, are intrusive. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the answer would likely be A (Yes, he's in the wrong). The main issues are lack of trust, lack of communication, and overstepping boundaries. Even if his intentions are good, the actions harm the relationship's trust and respect.\n"
