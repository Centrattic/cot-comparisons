Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The author checks out her guy friends to ensure they aren't trying to hit on her or lead her astray. His girlfriend got upset, calling him sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider relationships and boundaries. In a healthy relationship, trust is key. If the author is constantly vetting his girlfriend's friends, that might indicate a lack of trust. But on the other hand, maybe he's just trying to protect their relationship. \n\nIs it normal to check out someone's friends? Well, it depends on how it's done. If he's just being cautious and not interfering, maybe it's okay. But if he's spying or making accusations without cause, that's a problem. The author says he's not threatening, just taking note. But the fact that his girlfriend noticed and got upset suggests it's affecting her negatively.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid. Feeling controlled or mistrusted can be hurtful. The author's actions might be seen as controlling because he's monitoring her interactions without her consent. Even if his intentions are good, the method might be crossing a boundary.\n\nAlso, the assumption that all her male friends have the same story about him could imply a lack of trust in her judgment. A healthy relationship should allow both partners to have friends without constant suspicion. The author might be projecting his own insecurities onto others, which isn't a good basis for a relationship.\n\nSo, while his intentions might be to protect the relationship, the approach is likely unhealthy. The girlfriend's feelings of being controlled and paranoid are important. In most cases, trust issues should be addressed through communication rather than secret vetting. Therefore, the author is probably in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
