Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The scenario is that the author doesn't trust these friends, checks them out to ensure they don't hit on her or cause issues, and this led to an argument where the girlfriend called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of a healthy relationship. Trust is a fundamental component. The author's actions of vetting friends might stem from insecurity, but in a healthy relationship, both parties should trust each other. The fact that the author is monitoring the girlfriend's friends without her knowledge could be seen as a breach of trust and respect for her autonomy.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid. Feeling that her partner is controlling or sexist is justified if he's not trusting her judgment in choosing her friends. It's possible she feels her relationships are being invalidated, which can create resentment. The author's justification is that he wants to protect her, but the method of doing so without transparency is problematic.\n\nControl in relationships often manifests when one partner feels the need to monitor or restrict the other's social interactions without mutual agreement. The key here is whether the actions infringe on the girlfriend's personal freedom. Even if the intention is good, the act of secretly vetting friends can be controlling. The girlfriend might feel that her word isn't enough, leading to a lack of trust.\n\nAlso, the author mentions not trusting the guys but doesn't address whether the girlfriend's friends have done anything to warrant that distrust. If there's no evidence, the author's actions are based on assumptions, which can be a red flag. Healthy relationships involve open communication about insecurities rather than surveillance.\n\nSo, the author is likely in the wrong because his actions are controlling and lack trust. The girlfriend's feelings of being controlled and the impact on their relationship suggest that the author's approach is inappropriate. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
