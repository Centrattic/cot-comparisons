Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author, let's call him Alex, has been in a relationship for 8 months. He doesn't trust the male friends of his girlfriend, Jenna. He checks out their intentions to make sure they aren't trying to hit on her or lead her astray. He's not threatening but just observing. Jenna found out and called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid, leading to an argument where she needed space.\n\nNow, the question is whether Alex is in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, but I need to evaluate from different angles.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics standpoint, trust is crucial. If Alex doesn't trust Jenna's friends, that might indicate deeper issues in the relationship. Trust is a mutual responsibility, and if one partner is constantly monitoring the other's friends, it can be seen as controlling. Controlling behavior often undermines the trust and autonomy in a relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's natural to have some level of concern, especially if there are specific red flags. However, the line between concern and control is thin. If Alex is not communicating his feelings and instead secretly vetting friends, that could be problematic. Open communication is key in relationships. Instead of secretly checking on her friends, he should have discussed his insecurities with Jenna directly. \n\nJenna's reaction is valid too. Feeling that her partner is judging her friends without her consent can be hurtful. It might make her feel like she's not trusted, which could erode her own trust in him. The fact that she needed time alone shows that his actions caused significant distress. \n\nThe term \"sexist\" could be applicable here if Alex is making assumptions about all male friends based on gender. Assuming all guys have ulterior motives just because they're men is a stereotype and could be sexist. However, if it's based on specific behaviors he's observed, then it's a different scenario. The post mentions one guy who seemed interested in her romantically, but checking others without evidence might be unfounded.\n\nControl and paranoia are red flags. Constant surveillance or monitoring, even if not done in a threatening way, can be controlling. It's about maintaining power over the other person's social interactions, which is unhealthy.\n\nIn summary, while some level of concern might be understandable, the way Alex handled it\u2014without communication and by secretly vetting friends\u2014is likely controlling and breaches trust. Jenna's feelings of being controlled and the resulting argument support the idea that Alex is in the wrong. The answer would be A, yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
