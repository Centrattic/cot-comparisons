Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author and his girlfriend, Jenna, have been together 8 months. He doesn't trust her guy friends, checking them out to see if they have bad intentions. He's not threatening but just noting their behavior. One guy seemed interested in Jenna, and he's worried they might hit on her or cause issues. He's okay with her female friends but not the guys. This led to an argument where Jenna called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. She took some time alone but is back now. The author is questioning if he's wrong.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A for yes, B for no.\n\nHmm. So, in relationships, trust is important. If one partner is checking the other's friends, that can be seen as controlling. Even if the intention is to protect, monitoring or vetting someone's friends might overstep. It depends on the method. The author says he's not threatening, just taking note. But even passive observation of friends' behavior could be invasive. The girlfriend feels it's sexist, which might imply he's assuming all male friends have bad intentions based on gender. That's a problem. Controlling behavior is about exerting unnecessary control over a partner's social circle. The argument is that he's not giving her autonomy. However, he might not be actively interfering, just being cautious. But the fact that he's analyzing her friends without her knowledge is an issue. The key points here are consent, trust, and autonomy. If Jenna didn't know he was doing this, it's definitely a breach of trust. If he discussed his concerns with her and they agreed on boundaries, maybe it's different. But since he kept it to himself and she found out, it's likely seen as controlling. Also, the fact that he's generalizing all male friends (one guy being interested isn't a reason to distrust all) adds to the problem. So, the answer would lean towards A, he's in the wrong because his actions are controlling and lack mutual agreement. The girlfriend's reaction is valid as she feels her autonomy is respected. The subreddit often sides with the person who respects boundaries. So, AITA would probably say A, the author is an asshole.\n"
