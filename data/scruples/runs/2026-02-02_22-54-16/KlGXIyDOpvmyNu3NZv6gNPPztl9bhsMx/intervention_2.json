Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author \"vetting\" his girlfriend's male friends. The author justifies this because he doesn't trust them and wants to make sure they don't hit on her or cause issues. His GF got upset, called him controlling, etc.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to think about the dynamics here. The key point is whether \"vetting\" someone's friends is an overstep. From a relationship advice perspective, trust is crucial. If you don't trust your partner's friends, that's a red flag. But maybe the author's approach is a bit extreme. \n\nVetting implies he's actively checking up on her friends, maybe through social media, friends, or other means. That could be seen as invasive. The GF's reaction is valid because she might feel her privacy is being invaded, and it's controlling to monitor her social circle. Even if his intentions are good, the method might be problematic. \n\nAlso, the fact that she needed some space alone after the argument suggests that his actions caused significant distress. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and trust. If he can't trust her without checking up on her friends, that might be a deeper issue. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe he's just being cautious. But the line between concern and control is thin. The author's behavior could be seen as eroding trust. So, from a psychological and relationship advice standpoint, this is likely a case where the author is overstepping. \n\nThe answer here is probably A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). The reasoning is that his actions are controlling and lack trust, which can harm the relationship. Even if his intentions are to protect the relationship, the method is inappropriate. The GF's feelings of being controlled and the resulting conflict support this conclusion.\n"
