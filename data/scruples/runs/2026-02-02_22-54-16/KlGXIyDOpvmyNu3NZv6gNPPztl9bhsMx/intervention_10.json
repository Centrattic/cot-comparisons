Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this Reddit AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is vetting their girlfriend's male friends by checking them out to make sure they don't hit on her or lead her to cheat. The GF got upset, called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author's actions involve secretly checking out the guy friends, which could be seen as invasive. Trust is a big part of a relationship, and if the author doesn't trust their GF, that's a red flag. However, the GF's friends being male and the author's concern might stem from jealousy or insecurity. But the method of \"vetting\" without the GF's knowledge seems problematic. Open communication is key in relationships. If the author had concerns, they should have discussed them with Jenna instead of doing it secretly. The GF's reaction is valid because the author's actions could be seen as controlling and a violation of trust. Even if the intention is to protect, the approach is unhealthy. So the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A). But I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. The author isn't threatening, just taking notes, but the act of secretly vetting friends without consent is still an issue. So the answer is A.\n"
