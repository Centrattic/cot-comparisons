Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The author mentions checking out her guy friends to see their intentions, not being threatening, just taking notes. The girlfriend got upset, called him sexist, controlling, paranoid. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. So, first, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are the author's actions of vetting (checking out) the male friends, the girlfriend's reaction, and whether that makes the author wrong.\n\nVetting someone's friends can be a gray area. On one hand, trust is important in a relationship. If the author feels insecure or doesn't trust the friends, maybe he has some valid concerns. But on the other hand, checking up on the girlfriend's friends, especially without her knowledge, could be seen as controlling or invasive. The girlfriend feels it's sexist\u2014maybe because he's targeting the male friends specifically, implying a lack of trust in her judgment or fidelity. Controlling behavior can erode trust in a relationship. The fact that she needed space shows that his actions caused hurt feelings.\n\nThe author says he's not threatening, just taking note. But even passive observation without consent can be problematic. Privacy is a big deal. People in a relationship still have the right to privacy regarding their friends. If he's checking their social media, asking others about them, or doing background checks, that's encroaching on her autonomy.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid\u2014feeling that her friends are being judged and that her trust is not respected. If the author is acting out of jealousy or insecurity, that's a personal issue he should address, perhaps through communication with his partner. However, taking actions without her input or consent is where the problem lies.\n\nSo, the answer likely is that the author is in the wrong. The act of vetting without transparency or mutual agreement is controlling. Even if his intentions are to protect the relationship, the method is problematic. The girlfriend's feelings of being controlled and the need for space indicate that the author overstepped. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
