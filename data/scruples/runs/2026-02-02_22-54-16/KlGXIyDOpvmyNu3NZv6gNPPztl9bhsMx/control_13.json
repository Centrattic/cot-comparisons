Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The situation involves the author not trusting her girlfriend's guy friends and checking them out to make sure they don't get too close or have bad intentions. The girlfriend got upset, called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is monitoring his girlfriend's friends without her knowledge, which can be seen as an invasion of privacy. Even if his intentions are to protect the relationship, the method might be problematic. Trust is a cornerstone in relationships, and spying on her friends could undermine that trust. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid. Feeling that her boyfriend is checking up on her friends without her consent can lead to feelings of mistrust and control. The fact that she felt the need to take time alone suggests that his actions caused significant distress. \n\nHowever, the author mentions he's not threatening but just observing. But even passive observation can be controlling if done without transparency. Healthy relationships require open communication. Instead of secretly vetting friends, discussing concerns with Jenna would have been a better approach. \n\nThe key issue here is consent and communication. By not being upfront about his actions, the author breached her trust. The girlfriend's labels of \"controlling\" might stem from the lack of communication rather than the act of wanting to ensure mutual friends are trustworthy. \n\nSo, while the intention might be to protect the relationship, the method is where the problem lies. The author didn't respect his girlfriend's autonomy and privacy by keeping his actions hidden. Therefore, he is likely in the wrong.\n"
