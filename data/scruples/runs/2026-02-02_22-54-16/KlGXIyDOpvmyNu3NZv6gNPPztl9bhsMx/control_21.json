Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The author says he's doing this because he doesn't trust them and wants to make sure they aren't trying to hit on her or cause problems.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The relationship is 8 months old, and the guy is checking out his girlfriend's male friends. He mentions not trusting them, which could stem from insecurity or past experiences. But the key points are: he's actively vetting, which can be seen as controlling. The girlfriend felt it was sexist and controlling, leading to an argument where she wanted time alone.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner is constantly monitoring or vetting the other's friends, it can be a sign of control or lack of trust. Even if the intention is to protect the relationship, the method might be inappropriate. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that she felt disrespected or that her autonomy was violated.\n\nThe author might argue that he's just being cautious, but the problem is how it's affecting the relationship. The fact that the girlfriend left for a few days shows that his actions caused significant distress. Also, the term \"sexist\" implies that he's making assumptions about male friends' intentions without evidence, which is problematic.\n\nControl in relationships isn't just about overt actions; it's about the balance of trust and respect. The author's behavior might be seen as overstepping, especially if he's not discussing these concerns with his girlfriend directly instead of surveilling her friends. Healthy communication is key, and if he's not talking it out, that's another issue.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions likely cross into controlling behavior, making him at least partly responsible. The girlfriend's feelings of being controlled and the impact on their relationship suggest that he is in the wrong.\n"
