Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The author mentions they check out her guy friends to make sure they don't hit on her or cause trouble. The girlfriend got upset, calling them sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The author is in a relatively new relationship (8 months), which might explain some insecurity. But how does their behavior affect the relationship? Vetting friends can be seen as overstepping because it invades the girlfriend's autonomy. Trust is a big part of any relationship, and if the author is checking up on her friends without her knowledge, that could be a breach of trust.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid. Feeling like a partner is controlling can lead to resentment. The key here is whether the author's actions are justified. While everyone has the right to feel secure, the method matters. Instead of secretly vetting friends, open communication about concerns would be healthier. The author should discuss their feelings with Jenna rather than taking surveillance actions. \n\nAlso, labeling someone as sexist or controlling isn't always accurate, but in this case, the behavior does lean towards controlling since it's about monitoring her social circle without her consent. The author's justification is distrust, but trust is foundational in relationships. Even if their intentions are good, the approach is problematic. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong. Their actions are controlling and invasive, even if well-intentioned. The solution would be to communicate openly and work on building trust rather than using covert methods.\n"
