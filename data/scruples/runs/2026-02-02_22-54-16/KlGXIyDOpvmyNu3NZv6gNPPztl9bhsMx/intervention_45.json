Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their girlfriend, Jenna, have been together 8 months. He doesn't trust her male friends and checks them out to ensure they don't hit on her or cause issues. One guy was particularly interested in Jenna, and the author doesn't trust him. Jenna got upset, called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid, and needed some space. Now he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is concerned about his girlfriend's well-being and the relationship. He's trying to protect her from potential threats, which could be seen as caring. However, the method he's using\u2014vetting her friends\u2014might be overstepping. Trust is a key component in relationships. If he's not trusting her judgment in choosing friends, that could be a problem. Also, checking up on her friends without her knowledge might be seen as invasive and controlling, even if his intentions are good.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, mutual trust and respect are important. If one partner is constantly monitoring the other's interactions without open communication, it can lead to tension. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that she feels her boundaries are being crossed. The term \"controlling\" is a strong accusation, but it's possible the author's actions, while well-meaning, are perceived as such by her. The fact that he's doing this secretly (\"taking note of them\") adds to that perception.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that he's just being cautious, given that some friends might have romantic interest. But in a trust-based relationship, this kind of surveillance isn't typically considered healthy. It's more about the approach than the concern itself. Instead of vetting, open communication about his feelings and trust issues with Jenna might have been a better approach.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A) because his actions are invading her privacy, undermining trust, and coming off as controlling, even if his intentions are to protect. The key issue is the method and lack of transparency, which are more problematic than the concern itself.\n"
