Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author vetting their girlfriend's male friends.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and his girlfriend, Jenna, have been together 8 months. He doesn't trust her male friends, so he checks them out to ensure they don't hit on her or cause issues. Jenna found out, got upset, called him sexist, controlling, paranoid, and needed space. Now, he's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they want my take. The task is to decide between A (Yes, wrong) or B (No, not wrong).\n\nHmm. The main issue here is trust and boundaries in a relationship. The author's actions are based on his distrust of her friends. But is that acceptable? In relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner is constantly vetting the other's friends without their knowledge, that can be seen as controlling or lacking trust. Even if the intention is to protect, the method might be problematic. \n\nThe girlfriend feels that her privacy is invaded. By \"vetting\" her friends, the author is possibly overstepping. The fact that she called him sexist and controlling suggests that his actions are making her feel disrespected. The question is whether the author's actions are justified. \n\nIn many cases, partners might feel that checking someone's friends without their knowledge is an invasion of privacy. Unless there's a history of infidelity or specific reasons to be concerned, the author's behavior might be considered controlling. The 8-month mark is not that long, but even so, trust is expected. \n\nAlso, the author's approach is secretive. If he had concerns, a better approach might have been to communicate with Jenna and discuss boundaries. Instead of secretly vetting friends, which can lead to resentment and feeling controlled, open communication is healthier. \n\nSo, the author's intentions might be good, but the method is invasive. The answer is likely A, he's in the wrong because his actions are controlling and lack trust, even if it's out of concern.\n"
