Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of an AITA post is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The author explains that they don't trust these friends and have been checking them out to make sure they don't hit on their GF or lead her to cheat. The GF got upset, calling the author sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Trust is a big part of relationships, but the author's actions might be seen as invasive. Vetting someone else's friends can be a red flag. It's about boundaries. The author isn't just expressing concerns but is actively investigating the friends' intentions without their knowledge. That's a form of surveillance, which is controlling behavior.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid because respecting each other's social circles is important. If the author is doing this secretly, it's a breach of trust. Even if the motivation is to protect the relationship, the method is problematic. Healthy relationships involve communication, not covert actions. The author should have discussed their concerns with Jenna instead of taking matters into their own hands. So, the answer is likely A\u2014the author is in the wrong.\n"
