Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. So, the author is checking out her guy friends because he doesn't trust them, right? He wants to make sure they're not hitting on her or anything. But his GF got mad, called him sexist, controlling, paranoid.\n\nHmm. Well, first, the main issue is about trust in the relationship. If he doesn't trust her friends, that could be a red flag. In healthy relationships, trust is key. If he's feeling the need to vet her friends, that suggests he might not trust her, or maybe himself. But how is vetting done? He says he's just taking note of them, maybe checking out their intentions. But is that invading her privacy? Like, is he looking up their social media, talking to them, or is he just being cautious?\n\nWait, the author mentions that the girl figured out her guy friends have the same story about him. So maybe he's been asking them questions or monitoring their interactions? If he's approaching her friends and asking about their intentions, that could be seen as controlling. It's possible he's overstepping by involving her friends without her knowledge. Even if he's not directly threatening, the act of vetting without her consent is probably a problem.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction is valid. Feeling like her partner doesn't trust her or her friends can lead to resentment. She might feel that her autonomy is being questioned. The labels she used\u2014sexist, controlling, paranoid\u2014are pretty strong. But maybe they are accurate in this context. If he's making assumptions about all her male friends wanting her romantically, that's a form of sexism, implying that men are naturally a threat. It's a stereotype.\n\nOn the other hand, some people might feel that it's normal to be cautious about their partner's friends. But the line between being cautious and being controlling is thin. If the vetting is done in a way that invades privacy or makes the partner uncomfortable, then it's a problem. The author says he's not threatening, but the act itself is problematic because it's without her knowledge. Trust should be mutual. If he can't trust her judgment in choosing friends, that's a deeper issue in the relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong. The vetting without consent, the lack of trust, and the implications of his actions being controlling and sexist. The answer should be A.\n"
