Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The situation is that he's been checking out her guy friends to ensure they don't hit on her or cause trouble. He's not threatening but is just noting their intentions. His GF got upset, called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid, and took a few days off.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is monitoring his girlfriend's male friends without her knowledge. He mentions he doesn't trust them and wants to make sure they're good guys. The girlfriend found out and is upset, leading to an argument. The question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nTrust issues in relationships are common, but the method here is one-sided. The author isn't discussing his concerns with his girlfriend; he's making unilateral decisions about her friends. That's a red flag for being controlling. Even if he has good intentions, the act of vetting without consent can be seen as invasive. It's important to consider consent and communication in relationships. Checking someone's social circle without their knowledge might infringe on their autonomy. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she feels her space is being invaded. The author's actions might be based on insecurity or jealousy, but that doesn't justify controlling behavior. Healthy relationships require mutual trust and respect. If the author is worried about her friends, he should communicate his feelings and work with her to address any issues together. His approach comes off as secretive and distrustful, which can erode the relationship's foundation. So, the author is likely in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
