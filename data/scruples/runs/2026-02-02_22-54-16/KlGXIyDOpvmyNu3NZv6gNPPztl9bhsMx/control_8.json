Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The situation is that he's been checking out her guy friends to see if they have romantic intentions towards her, which made her upset. She called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's reasoning is that he doesn't trust these guys and wants to ensure they aren't trying to hit on her or cause issues. But from her standpoint, he's invading her privacy and being controlling. \n\nJealousy and trust issues are common in relationships, but the method of dealing with them matters. Checking on her friends without her knowledge crosses a boundary. Trust is a two-way street, and if he's not trusting her, that could erode the relationship. Also, his actions might be seen as sexist if he's only targeting her male friends and not considering her judgment. \n\nThere's a difference between having concerns and acting on them in a way that's overbearing. Healthy relationships require open communication. Instead of vetting her friends secretly, discussing his insecurities with her might have been a better approach. His actions led to an argument and her needing space, which shows the impact of his behavior on the relationship.\n\nControl and paranoia aren't positive traits. If he's not giving her the autonomy to manage her friendships, that's a problem. It's possible he's projecting his own insecurities onto her friends. The fact that she's okay with her female friends but not male ones might indicate a double standard. \n\nIn most cases, unless there's a history of cheating or abuse, it's generally expected to trust your partner's judgment. His actions could be seen as undermining her trustworthiness and independence. So, the answer is likely that he's in the wrong because his actions are controlling and lack trust.\n"
