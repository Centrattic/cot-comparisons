Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The situation is that he's been checking out her guy friends because he doesn't trust them, thinking some might have romantic intentions towards her. He says he's not threatening, just taking note. She called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid, and wants him to get a day or two alone. Now he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Trust is a big part of any relationship. If someone isn't trusting their partner's friends without concrete evidence, that could be an issue. The girlfriend is upset because her male friends have similar stories about the author, implying that he's been prying or maybe confronting them. The author's actions might be seen as overstepping, especially if he hasn't communicated his concerns to her first. \n\nJealousy is normal, but acting on it without evidence can be controlling. Checking up on her friends without her knowledge might breach trust. Also, the fact that her friends have the same stories suggests that maybe the author is being too intrusive. The girlfriend's response about him being sexist and controlling is a red flag because it indicates that his actions are making her feel disrespected or restricted. \n\nIn healthy relationships, communication is key. Instead of secretly vetting her friends, he should have discussed his feelings with her. His approach seems to be about control rather than trust. Even if his intentions are to protect her, the method is problematic. The girlfriend's need for space shows that she feels his actions are harmful to the relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because his actions are intrusive and controlling, which can erode trust and respect in the relationship. The answer should be A.\n"
