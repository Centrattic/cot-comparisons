Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The situation is that the author has been checking out Jenna's guy friends because he doesn't trust them and wants to make sure they aren't hitting on her or causing issues. Jenna got upset, called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is monitoring his girlfriend's male friends without her knowledge. That's a key point. Trust in a relationship is important, but the method here is invasive. If he's checking on her friends without her consent, that's a red flag. It's one thing to have concerns, but acting on them secretly without discussing them can be controlling.\n\nThen there's the aspect of trust. The author mentions he doesn't trust Jenna's guy friends, but he hasn't discussed these concerns with her. Instead, he's taking it upon himself to investigate. Open communication is vital in relationships. If he had talked to Jenna about his feelings of insecurity, maybe they could have found a solution together.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also valid. Feeling that her partner is spying on her friends can be hurtful and may lead to feelings of being controlled. The fact that she needed time alone shows the impact of his actions. The author's actions might be driven by insecurity, but they cross into controlling behavior.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption that the guy friends have the same story about him. If he's using this as a reason to distrust them, maybe he's projecting his own insecurities. It's possible that the friends aren't as threatening as he believes, and his actions are based on paranoia rather than real evidence.\n\nAlso, considering that the relationship is only 8 months old, maybe the author's need for control is stemming from not yet feeling secure in the relationship. However, that doesn't justify his actions. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and trust, which includes respecting each other's social circles.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are invasive, lack communication, and can be seen as controlling. The girlfriend's feelings of being controlled and the resulting conflict suggest that the author is indeed in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
