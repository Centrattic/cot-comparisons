Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is checking out their girlfriend's male friends, right? They don't trust them and want to make sure these guys aren't trying to hit on her or make her cheat. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, calling the author sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's considered healthy in a relationship. Trust is a big part of any relationship. If someone is constantly questioning the partner's friends, especially of the opposite sex, that can be seen as controlling. But the author says they're just \"vetting,\" not threatening. They mention they're not doing anything aggressive, just observing and taking notes. However, the fact that they're doing this without the girlfriend's knowledge might be the problem. \n\nThe girlfriend feels that her friends are being judged without their consent. Even if the author's intentions are to protect the relationship, invading her privacy by checking out her friends could be a breach of trust. It's possible that the author is projecting their own insecurities onto the girlfriend's friendships. Maybe they're jealous or have trust issues themselves. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because it's her right to have friends, and the author's actions might make her feel like she's being controlled. \n\nOn the other hand, some people might think that wanting to protect one's partner from potential threats is natural. But the line between protectiveness and control can be thin. The key issue here is the lack of communication. The author didn't discuss their concerns with the girlfriend instead of taking it upon themselves to investigate.Healthy relationships require open communication, and keeping such actions secret can lead to misunderstandings and resentment.\n\nAlso, the term \"sexist\" and \"controlling\" from the girlfriend's side suggests that she feels the author is making assumptions based on gender. Maybe the author is being unfair to the male friends without evidence. If there's no specific reason to believe those friends are a problem, then the actions could be seen as unnecessary. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might stem from wanting to protect their relationship, the method of \"vetting\" without transparency or discussion is problematic. It invades the girlfriend's privacy and undermines trust. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
