Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The writer is checking out her guy friends to make sure they're not trying to hit on her or cause trouble. They got into an argument with Jenna, who called them sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the dynamics here. The writer is in a relationship where they have trust issues, specifically with the girlfriend's male friends. They're not threatening but just observing and noting their intentions. On the other hand, Jenna feels that the writer is overstepping, which led to her needing space.\n\nTrust is a big part of relationships. If someone doesn't trust their partner's friends, that can be a red flag. But maybe there's a valid concern here. However, the way the writer is handling it\u2014vetting without discussing it with Jenna\u2014could be problematic. It might come off as controlling because it's an invasion of privacy. The writer isn't necessarily wrong in feeling unsure, but the method of addressing it without communication is likely the issue.\n\nAlso, Jenna's reaction is important. She feels that her autonomy is compromised if her partner is checking on her friends. The term \"controlling\" is serious, and if the writer is making decisions based on their own suspicions without talking things over, that could be seen as manipulative. The writer mentions they don't trust the guy friends, but maybe the real issue is the lack of trust in the relationship itself. Trust should be built on mutual respect, not surveillance.\n\nAnother angle: the writer is projecting their own insecurities onto Jenna's friends. They assume the friends have ulterior motives without evidence. This can create a toxic environment where the partner feels monitored. Healthy relationships require open communication. Instead of vetting, the writer should discuss their feelings with Jenna and find a solution together.\n\nSo, while the writer's intentions might be to protect the relationship, their actions are likely crossing boundaries. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their behavior is controlling and lacks trust, which is essential in a healthy relationship.\n"
