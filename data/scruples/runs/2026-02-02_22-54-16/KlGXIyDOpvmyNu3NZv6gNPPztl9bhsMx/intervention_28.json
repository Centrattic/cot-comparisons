Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The scenario involves checking out her guy friends to ensure they don't hit on her or cause issues. The girlfriend called them sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they're not threatening, just taking note. They don't trust some of the friends, which might stem from insecurity or past experiences. But does that justify their actions? Trust is a cornerstone of any relationship, so if trust isn't there, that's a problem. However, the method of \"vetting\" could be intrusive. How exactly are they checking these friends? If it's just observation, maybe it's not too bad, but if it's more like stalking or prying into private matters, that's an issue.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is significant. She felt that her partner was being controlling. Control in a relationship can be toxic, especially if it's overstepping boundaries. Even if the intention is to protect, the means should respect the partner's autonomy. The fact that she needed time alone suggests the actions hurt her. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning that they're okay with female friends but not male ones might introduce a double standard. That could contribute to the sexism claim. If the author is treating male friends differently just because of their gender, that's problematic. However, if the concern is based on specific behaviors from the male friends, it's a bit more nuanced.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't discuss their concerns with Jenna before taking action. Instead of vetting secretly, a better approach would be to talk about their insecurities and set boundaries together. The fact that Jenna found out because she pieced things together indicates a lack of transparency, which can lead to mistrust.\n\nSo, putting it all together: While the author's intention might be to protect, the method used (vetting without discussion) is likely overstepping. The girlfriend's feelings of being controlled are valid. Even if the outcome isn't malicious, the act itself can be controlling and disrespectful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
