Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about \"vetting\" their girlfriend's male friends. The author, let's call him Alex, has been checking out Jenna's guy friends to make sure they're not hitting on her or trying to get her to cheat. Jenna got mad, called him sexist, controlling, paranoid, and needed some space.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. Trust is fundamental in any partnership. If Alex doesn't trust Jenna's friends, maybe there's an underlying issue like insecurity or past experiences. But the act of vetting without discussing it with her first could be problematic. It's one thing to have concerns and another to act on them without her knowledge or consent.\n\nJenna's reaction is important. She felt that his actions were controlling and sexist. That suggests she felt his actions were overstepping, maybe even violating her autonomy. Checking up on her friends without her knowledge could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if his intentions are to protect the relationship, the method might be intrusive.\n\nThe question is whether his actions cross into controlling behavior. Controlling behavior often involves trying to manage or restrict a partner's social interactions without their agreement. If Alex is monitoring her friends and making judgments without communicating his concerns, that could be seen as controlling. It's possible that instead of vetting, he should have talked to Jenna about his insecurities and let her handle the situation with her friends.\n\nAlso, labeling him as sexist or paranoid might be her way of expressing that his actions are based on assumptions about all male friends wanting her romantically, which could be a stereotype. That could contribute to the perception of sexism.\n\nBut on the other hand, some people might argue that having concerns about a partner's friends is normal, especially in a new relationship. However, the key is how those concerns are addressed. If he shared his concerns with Jenna and worked together, that's different from doing it secretly.\n\nThe outcome is that Jenna felt hurt and needed space, which indicates that his actions affected the relationship negatively. Trust and open communication are usually better approaches than unilateral actions.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because his actions can be seen as controlling and a lack of trust without communication.\n"
