Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA story is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The author, let's call him Alex, has been checking out Jenna's guy friends to make sure they aren't trying to hit on her or something worse. He says he's not threatening, just taking notes. But Jenna got upset, calling him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. Now he's wondering if he's an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to think about trust in a relationship. Trust is foundational. If Alex doesn't trust Jenna's male friends without clear evidence, that could be a red flag. He mentions not trusting them because he thinks some might be interested in Jenna. But without evidence, this seems like jealousy or insecurity. \n\nThen there's the action of vetting. What does that mean exactly? If he's just observing and not confronting her or the friends, maybe it's passive. But even passive surveillance can feel controlling. Jenna's reaction is important here\u2014she felt he was being sexist and controlling. She had to find out he was doing this, which suggests he didn't communicate openly. \n\nControl and paranoia are key terms. If someone is constantly questioning the other's social circles without cause, it can be suffocating. The fact that he's okay with her female friends but not male ones might hint at gender bias, hence her calling him sexist. \n\nAlso, the duration of the relationship is 8 months. Early relationships can have trust issues, but it's still important to build mutual trust. If there's no history of infidelity or problems with the friends, his actions might be unfounded. \n\nHe argues it's to protect the relationship, but healthy relationships require trust. His actions might be seen as violating her privacy and autonomy. Jenna needing time alone shows how hurt she was. \n\nSo putting it together: lack of trust without evidence, possible gender bias, invasion of privacy, and control issues. All these points make the author the asshole here. Answer A.\n"
