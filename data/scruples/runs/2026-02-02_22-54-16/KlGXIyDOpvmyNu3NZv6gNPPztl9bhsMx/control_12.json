Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nSo, the situation is the author and their girlfriend Jenna have been together for 8 months. The author doesn't trust her male friends, thinking some might be interested in her romantically. They check out these guys to ensure they don't hit on her or cause her to cheat. The girlfriend found out, got upset, called the author sexist, controlling, and paranoid, and needed time alone. Now, the author is questioning if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The author's actions involve monitoring or investigating their girlfriend's male friends without her knowledge. The main issue is the lack of trust and the method used to address it. In relationships, trust is fundamental. If the author doesn't trust Jenna's male friends but hasn't discussed it with her, that's a problem. Open communication is usually the best approach. Instead of secretly vetting them, the author should have talked to Jenna about their feelings of insecurity. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction is valid. Feeling that her partner is checking up on her friends without her consent can be seen as controlling and a breach of trust. The author's justification is based on wanting to prevent potential issues, but the approach is invasive. The fact that the author is fine with her female friends but not male ones might come off as sexist, as it implies a double standard. \n\nEven if the author's intentions are good, the method is problematic. Trust is built on mutual respect and communication, not on one person's unilateral actions to monitor the other's social circle. The girlfriend being upset and needing space shows that the author's actions caused harm to the relationship. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because their actions were controlling and lacked transparency, which is essential in a healthy relationship. The author's approach is not healthy, even if the concern is understandable. The right thing to do is address insecurities through communication and building trust, not by secretly vetting others.\n"
