Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The key points here are about trust, control, and communication in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they don't trust their girlfriend's guy friends and check them out to make sure they aren't a threat. While the intention is to protect the relationship, the method here is important. Vetting could mean looking into their backgrounds, maybe checking social media, or even confronting the friends. But without the girlfriend's knowledge, this could come off as controlling.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is significant. She called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. These are strong accusations. Being controlling often involves overstepping boundaries and not respecting a partner's autonomy. Even if the author isn't being overtly threatening, the act of secretly vetting friends without her consent can erode trust.\n\nCommunication is another factor. The argument arose because she discovered the vetting. If they had discussed his concerns beforehand, maybe they could have found a mutual solution. But acting unilaterally without discussing might have made her feel disrespected.\n\nAlso, considering that the relationship is only 8 months old, such behavior might indicate insecurity or a lack of trust, which are red flags in a relationship. Healthy relationships require mutual trust and respect for each other's social circles unless there's a documented reason to be concerned.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions might be to protect the relationship, the actions taken are problematic because they infringe on the girlfriend's autonomy and privacy without her consent. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because controlling behavior can damage trust and is generally considered unhealthy in relationships.\n"
