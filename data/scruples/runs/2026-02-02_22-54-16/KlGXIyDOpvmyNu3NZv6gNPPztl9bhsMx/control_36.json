Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The situation is that they've been together 8 months, and the author doesn't trust the guy friends. They check them out to make sure they don't hit on her or cause issues. The GF got mad, called him sexist and controlling, and took a break. Now he's wondering if he's an asshole.\n\nFirst, the key points here: the author is monitoring the GF's male friends without her knowledge. Even if he's not threatening, the act of secretly vetting them could be seen as a breach of trust. In healthy relationships, communication is key. If he had concerns, he should have discussed them with Jenna instead of doing his own investigation. \n\nThe GF's reaction is important. She felt he was controlling and sexist, which are serious accusations. The fact that she needed time alone shows how hurt she was. Even if his intentions were to protect the relationship, the method was invasive. Trust is a two-way street, and his actions might be eroding the trust she has in him.\n\nAlso, the duration of the relationship is 8 months. Jealousy or insecurity can happen, but the way he's handling it is problematic. It's not about the content of his feelings but the actions taken. Vetting friends without consent is a form of control. People should be able to have friends without their partner interfering, especially if there's no evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nSo, the answer here is likely A, the author is in the wrong. His actions, while stemming from insecurity, are controlling and lack communication. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and trust, not surveillance.\n"
