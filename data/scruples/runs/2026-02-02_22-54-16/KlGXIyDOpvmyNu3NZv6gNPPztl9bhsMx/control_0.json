Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. So, the author and his girlfriend Jenna have been together 8 months. He doesn't trust her male friends, thinks some might be interested in her romantically. He checks them out to make sure they don't hit on her or lead her to cheat. Jenna got angry, called him sexist, controlling, paranoid. Now he's wondering if he's an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider general relationship norms. Trust is a big part of any relationship. If he doesn't trust her friends, that might indicate underlying issues in the relationship. Vetting someone else's friends can be seen as controlling. But maybe there's a valid concern if someone is actually acting inappropriately.\n\nHe mentions he's not threatening, just taking notes. The guy in question seemed interested in Jenna. But does he have proof? If he's just assuming intentions, that's problematic. Paranoia can lead to controlling behavior. Controlling behavior is usually a red flag because it's about maintaining power and can lead to abuse.\n\nJenna called him controlling and sexist. Maybe he's projecting his distrust onto her friends without evidence. Sexism could come into play if he's making assumptions about all male friends based on stereotypes. Also, expecting her friends to not discuss the relationship deeply might be unrealistic.\n\nHe's okay with her having female friends but not male ones, which could be a double standard. It's possible he's overstepping by investigating her friends' intentions without her knowledge. Consent and communication are key here. He didn't discuss his concerns with her, leading to a breakdown in trust.\n\nSo, the consensus would likely be that the author is in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
