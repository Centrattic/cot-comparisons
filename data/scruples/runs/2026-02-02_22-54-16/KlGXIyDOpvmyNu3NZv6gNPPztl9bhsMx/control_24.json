Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. So first, I need to understand the situation clearly.\n\nThe author and Jenna have been together for 8 months. He's checking out her male friends to see their intentions, making sure they don't hit on her or lead her to cheat. He's not threatening but just taking note. Then there was a guy who seemed interested in her, which the author didn't trust. Jenna got upset, called him sexist, controlling, paranoid, and took a couple of days alone. Now the author is wondering if he's an asshole or if he was right to protect the relationship.\n\nHmm, AITA (Am I the Asshole) questions usually involve social norms and boundaries. So the key here is about trust and boundaries in a relationship. The author is being accused of being controlling. In most cases, controlling behavior is seen as a red flag. But he's not doing anything overtly controlling, like restricting her interactions. He's just vetting, maybe through social media or talking to them. But that act of vetting itself could be invasive. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is important. She felt that her privacy was invaded, maybe by the author looking into her friends' lives, checking their stories, etc. If he's not directly interfering but just gathering information, it's still about trust. The author's lack of trust might indicate insecurity or a need to control, which can be problematic. \n\nAlso, in a healthy relationship, open communication is key. Instead of secretly vetting her friends, maybe he should have talked to her about his concerns. The fact that she pieced it together suggests that he didn't communicate openly, which could lead to feelings of being spied on or mistrusted without cause. \n\nThe author might have good intentions, but the method of action could be wrong. He's assuming negative intentions of her male friends without evidence. That could be considered paranoid. The girlfriend has the right to have friends of any gender, and the author's actions might undermine her autonomy. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A. The author's behavior is controlling and erodes trust, even if he's not threatening. The girlfriend's right to privacy and her own friendships is important. He should have communicated his feelings instead of vetting secretly. So yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
