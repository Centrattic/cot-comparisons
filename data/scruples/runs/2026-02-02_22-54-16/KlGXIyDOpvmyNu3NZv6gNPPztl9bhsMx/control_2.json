Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. So first, I need to understand the situation from both perspectives.\n\nThe author, let's call him John, is in an 8-month relationship with his girlfriend, Jenna. He doesn't trust her male friends and checks them out to make sure they aren't trying to hit on her or cause issues. He's not threatening, just observing. However, Jenna got upset, called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid, and needed space. Now John is wondering if he was wrong.\n\nHmm. Trust issues in relationships are common, but the approach matters. John is monitoring her friends without her knowledge, which seems like a breach of trust. Even if his intentions are to protect the relationship, doing it behind her back is a problem. Open communication is key in relationships. Instead of secretly vetting her friends, he should have talked to her about his concerns.\n\nJenna's reaction is valid because she feels her autonomy is being invaded. She might see his actions as controlling, regardless of his intentions. Trust is a two-way street. If John can't trust her judgment in choosing friends, that could lead to bigger issues. It's possible that John's lack of trust stems from insecurity or past experiences, but that doesn't justify his actions.\n\nFrom a relationship advice perspective, the general consensus would likely be that John's actions are controlling. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and trust. Monitoring someone's friends without their knowledge undermines that trust. Even if Jenna's friends aren't a threat, John's behavior sets a precedent for controlling behavior, which can erode the relationship over time.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is probably A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). The action of secretly vetting friends without discussing it with Jenna is controlling and breaches trust, even if his intentions are protective. The right approach would have been to communicate his concerns openly and work together to build trust.\n"
