Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The author mentions checking out her guy friends to see their intentions and ensuring they don't hit on her or lead to cheating. They aren't being threatening, just taking notes. The girlfriend got upset, calling them sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nHmm, so from a relationship perspective, I know that trust is a big component. If the author doesn't trust the guy friends, that's a red flag. But what's the line here? Checking out friends to make sure they're not a threat versus actually spying on them. The author says they're not threatening, just observing. But even so, it's a form of surveillance without the girlfriend's knowledge or consent. That could be seen as controlling because it's about monitoring her social circle instead of discussing concerns openly. The girlfriend's reaction indicates that she felt her privacy was invaded or that her autonomy was disrespected. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is based on fear of cheating. But if there's no evidence of any wrongdoing, this might be more about insecurity rather than justified concern. In healthy relationships, communication is key. Instead of secretly vetting her friends, the author should have talked to her about their feelings. The fact that the author didn't do that and instead acted on their own could be the issue. The girlfriend having many friends, including male ones, is normal unless there's a specific reason for concern. The author's actions might not be physically harmful, but they could erode trust in the relationship. \n\nSo, even if the author's intentions are to protect the relationship, the method of doing so without transparency is problematic. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because the approach is controlling and lacks communication. The key here is the method and the lack of addressing the issue directly with the girlfriend.\n"
