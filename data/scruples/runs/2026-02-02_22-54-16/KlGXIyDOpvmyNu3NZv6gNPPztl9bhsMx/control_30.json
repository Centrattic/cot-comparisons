Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author, let's call him \"John,\" is in an 8-month relationship with his girlfriend, Jenna. He doesn't trust her male friends and has been checking them out to see their intentions. He's not threatening but just taking notes. The issue arose when Jenna found out and got upset, calling him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. Now, he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I should consider the concept of trust in relationships. Trust is foundational. If John doesn't trust Jenna's male friends, that might indicate a lack of trust in Jenna herself. Even if there's no evidence of her cheating, his actions could be seen as controlling. He's essentially monitoring her interactions without her knowledge, which is a red flag in many relationships. People often value their autonomy and privacy, so being spied on, even with good intentions, can be hurtful.\n\nNext, the term \"sexist\" is used by Jenna. Is John being sexist? If he's only targeting Jenna's male friends and not her female friends, that could be sexist because it's assuming all men have bad intentions. That's a form of stereotyping. On the other hand, if he had similar concerns about her female friends, that might be different, but from the story, it's only the guys.\n\nThen there's the idea of controlling behavior. Controlling partners often try to manage their partner's social interactions. By vetting her friends, he might be overstepping his boundaries. Healthy relationships usually require mutual respect for each other's social circles unless there's a specific reason to be concerned, which in this case isn't mentioned. The fact that Jenna was upset and needed space shows that his actions affected her emotionally.\n\nThe length of the relationship is 8 months. While some level of concern is normal, the method of dealing with it by secretly vetting friends isn't. Open communication is key. If John had concerns, he should have discussed them with Jenna instead of taking it upon himself to investigate. Secretive investigations can lead to mistrust and resentment.\n\nAlso, the justification that he's just trying to protect Jenna might not hold up. Trusting her and respecting her judgment about her friends is important. If Jenna has vetted her own friends and feels comfortable with them, John's interference undermines that.\n\nThe part where he says he's fine with her having lady friends but not the guys might indicate a double standard. Why are the male friends a problem when female friends aren't? It could imply that he's projecting his own insecurities or societal stereotypes onto the male friends. \n\nJenna's reaction was getting angry and needing time alone, which is a valid response to feeling controlled. The fact that things are calm now doesn't erase the initial issue. John's actions could lead to future conflicts if not addressed properly.\n\nIn conclusion, while he might have good intentions, the method of \"vetting\" without transparency and the underlying assumptions about male friends' intentions cross into controlling and possibly sexist behavior. The answer is likely A, yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
