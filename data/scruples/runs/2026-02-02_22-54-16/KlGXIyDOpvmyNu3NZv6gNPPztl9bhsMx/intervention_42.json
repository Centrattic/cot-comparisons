Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. I need to determine if the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author has been with his girlfriend Jenna for 8 months. He doesn't trust her male friends and checks them out to ensure they don't hit on her or cause issues. Jenna found out and is upset, calling him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nSo, the main points here are about trust in a relationship. The author's actions are based on not trusting Jenna's guy friends. But in a healthy relationship, trust is a fundamental component. Checking up on her friends without her consent or knowledge can be seen as an invasion of privacy. \n\nThe author mentions they aren't threatening, just taking notes. However, the method of checking might be problematic. Are they following her, looking up her friends online, or asking mutual friends? The post doesn't specify, but it's implied that Jenna figured out her guy friends had a \"same story\" about the author. This suggests that the author might be discussing her friends with others or perhaps not being open about his actions, which could be controlling.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author is uncomfortable with Jenna having male friends, even if it's just for general friendship, might indicate jealousy or insecurity. The key question is whether the author's actions are justified. While it's normal to have some concern about a partner's friends, the method and extent of the vetting matter. If it's done in a way that undermines Jenna's autonomy and trust, then it's likely the author is in the wrong.\n\nJenna being upset and needing time alone shows that the author's behavior affected her feelings. Even if the author's intention is to protect the relationship, the approach can be seen as overstepping. The labels she used\u2014sexist, controlling, paranoid\u2014highlight that she perceives his actions as discriminatory and possessive. \n\nIn most relationship advice, trust and communication are emphasized. The author didn't communicate his concerns to Jenna, instead choosing to \"vet\" her friends behind her back. This lack of communication is a red flag. Healthy relationships require open dialogue about insecurities rather than covert actions. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because the actions described are controlling and lack trust, which can damage the relationship. The author's justification doesn't override the impact of his actions on his partner's feelings and independence.\n"
