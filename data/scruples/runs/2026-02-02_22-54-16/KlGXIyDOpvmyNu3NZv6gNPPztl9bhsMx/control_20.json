Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The key points here are about trust, control, and respect in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author mentions he doesn't trust his girlfriend's male friends and checks them out to ensure they aren't trying to hit on her or cause issues. He's not threatening but taking notes. The girlfriend is upset, calling him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. \n\nIn healthy relationships, trust is fundamental. If he's constantly vetting her friends, that could indicate a lack of trust, which can be a red flag. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she might feel that his actions are controlling. He's making assumptions about her friends' intentions without discussing it with her, which can be seen as invasive. \n\nEven if his intentions are to protect the relationship, the method of doing it without her knowledge oversteps. Partners should communicate openly about concerns rather than taking matters into their own hands. The fact that she's upset and needed space shows that his actions caused harm to their relationship. \n\nWhile it's common to have some level of concern about a partner's friends, the line is crossed when it becomes surveillance or control. The author's actions could be seen as patriarchal, assuming that all male friends have ulterior motives, which is sexist. The girlfriend's labels of sexist and controlling aren't unfounded here.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is likely in the wrong because his actions breach trust, respect, and open communication, which are essential in a healthy relationship.\n"
