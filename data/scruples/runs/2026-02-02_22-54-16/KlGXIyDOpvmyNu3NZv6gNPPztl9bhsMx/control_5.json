Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. So the situation is that the author, let's call them Alex, has been checking out Jenna's male friends to make sure they don't hit on her or cause any issues. They mention they're not threatening but just taking notes. The girlfriend got upset, called Alex sexist, controlling, and paranoid. The question is whether Alex is an asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of trust in a relationship. Trust is fundamental, and if one partner is constantly checking on the other's friends, that can be seen as a breach of trust. The author's actions might stem from insecurity or fear of cheating, but how they go about it matters. \n\nVetting someone else's friends without their knowledge is a big step. Even if the intention is to protect, it can come off as controlling. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she might feel her privacy is invaded. She has the right to have friends of any gender, and the fact that the author is singling out male friends could imply a double standard, which could be perceived as sexist. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they're okay with her female friends as long as they don't discuss the relationship too much. That inconsistency might highlight a biased approach. If the author was concerned about all friends, regardless of gender, it might be different. But focusing on male friends because they might have romantic interest is problematic. \n\nCommunication is key here. If the author had discussed their feelings with Jenna instead of secretly vetting her friends, they might have found a solution together. The fact that Jenna feels the need for space after discovering this shows the situation has caused tension. \n\nThe girlfriend's labels of controlling and paranoid aren't baseless. Controlling behavior often involves monitoring and restricting the other person's social interactions. Even if it's not overtly threatening, the act of vetting without consent can be controlling. Paranoia might stem from the author's distrust, which isn't healthy in a relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that concern is normal, especially in a new relationship. However, 8 months in, a certain level of trust should be established. The method of checking up on friends without discussion is where the issue lies. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are likely making them an asshole (AITA) because they're overstepping boundaries and violating trust. The answer is A.\n"
