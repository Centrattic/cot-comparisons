Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. So, the author is checking out Jenna's guy friends to make sure they don't hit on her or cause trouble. The girlfriend got upset, called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a relationship and feels the need to monitor or vet their partner's friends. That immediately makes me think about boundaries and trust in relationships. In a healthy relationship, trust is key. If one partner is feeling the need to check up on the other's friends, that might indicate a lack of trust. \n\nThe author mentions they aren't threatening but just \"taking note.\" But even passive observation can be seen as intrusive. The girlfriend's reaction is important here. She felt that his actions were controlling and sexist. Controlling behavior often involves trying to manage or restrict a partner's interactions, which can be harmful. \n\nThe argument that the author is just protecting the relationship doesn't automatically justify the actions. It's about how those actions are perceived and their impact. If the partner feels disrespected or controlled, then the author's actions are problematic. \n\nAlso, the fact that the girlfriend noticed the common story among her friends suggests that the author's vetting was apparent, which could make her feel like he doesn't trust her. Jealousy or insecurity are common, but acting on them in a way that invades the partner's autonomy can be an issue.\n\nSo, in most relationship advice, trust is emphasized. Without clear evidence of wrongdoing, vetting friends can come off as controlling. The author's justification of \"just making sure\" might not be enough if it makes the partner uncomfortable. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
