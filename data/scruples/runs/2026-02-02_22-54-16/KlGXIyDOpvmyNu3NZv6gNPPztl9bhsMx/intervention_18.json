Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The main points are about trust and control in the relationship.\n\nFirst, the guy mentions he doesn't trust Jenna's guy friends and checks them out to make sure they don't hit on her or cause trouble. His GF is upset, calling him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. He's wondering if he's an asshole.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust is crucial. If one person isn't trusting the other's friends without solid reasons, that could be seen as controlling. The line between being protective and being controlling can be blurry. The fact that Jenna is her own person, and she's upset about his actions suggests that his behavior crossed a boundary. Even if his intentions are to protect, doing so without her consent or causing her distress can be problematic. The key here is whether his actions are based on jealousy or insecurity rather than actual evidence of wrongdoing by her friends. Without clear reasons, it's likely he's overstepping, making him the asshole in this scenario.\n"
