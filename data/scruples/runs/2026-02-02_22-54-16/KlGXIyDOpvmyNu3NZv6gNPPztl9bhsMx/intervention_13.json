Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The situation involves him checking out her male friends to ensure they don't hit on her or lead her to cheat. The girlfriend got upset, calling him sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author mentions he's not threatening but just taking notes. He's concerned about the intentions of her male friends. However, the girlfriend felt it was controlling and sexist. The question is whether his actions are justified or if he overstepped.\n\nFrom a relationship dynamics perspective, trust is crucial. If someone is in a healthy relationship, they should trust their partner. Constantly vetting friends, especially without their knowledge, might be seen as a breach of trust or privacy. The author is acting out of jealousy, but the method of checking up on her friends without her consent could be problematic. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid because she feels her autonomy is being undermined. Being called controlling and sexist suggests that her male friends might feel targeted based on their gender, implying a sexist viewpoint. Checking people's intentions based on their gender could indeed be sexist if it's a generalization.\n\nHowever, the author's intention is to protect the relationship. But the way he's doing it\u2014without her knowledge and without discussing it\u2014might be controlling. Healthy relationships involve communication rather than covert actions. \n\nIn summary, while the author has valid concerns about trust, his approach of secretly vetting friends without discussing it with his girlfriend likely crossed into controlling behavior. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because his actions, though stemming from insecurity, are invasive and not communicated, leading to valid feelings of being controlled and disrespected on his partner's part.\n"
