Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. So, the situation is that they've been together 8 months, and the author is checking out her guy friends to make sure they don't hit on her or cause issues. The GF got mad, called them sexist, controlling, paranoid. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Trust is a big part of relationships. If the author doesn't trust their GF's male friends, that could be a red flag. But why don't they trust them? Is it based on past experiences or just assumptions? The author mentions that there's at least one guy who probably wants her, so maybe they're being overcautious. But vetting them without telling her might be an issue. \n\nCommunication is key. If they had concerns, they should have talked to Jenna first instead of doing it behind her back. By checking out her friends without discussing it, the author might be violating her trust. It's one thing to have concerns, but acting on them secretly can come off as controlling. The GF is upset because she feels her privacy is invaded. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning might be based on stereotypes. Assuming that all male friends have romantic intentions could be sexist. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and trust. Being overly suspicious without evidence can lead to problems. The fact that Jenna is now back but the argument still lingers suggests there's unresolved tension. \n\nAre there any cultural or personal factors? The user mentions they're not threatening, just taking notes. But the method of vetting isn't clear. If they're checking social media or talking to her friends behind her back, that's definitely a no-go. Trust should be built through open dialogue, not surveillance. \n\nThe answer probably leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the approach is invasive without communication. Even if the intentions are to protect, the method used is controlling. The GF's reaction is valid because she has a right to privacy and open discussion about such issues. The author should address their trust issues directly with her instead of secretly vetting her friends.\n"
