Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The author checks out her guy friends to make sure they aren't trying to hit on her or cause trouble. His GF got upset, calling him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. Trust in a relationship is crucial. If the author doesn't trust his girlfriend's friends, that's a red flag. Trust is usually a two-way street, and if he's not trusting her judgment about her friends, maybe he's projecting his own insecurities. Then there's the aspect of privacy. Even if he's just \"checking out\" her friends, maybe he's overstepping by investigating them without her knowledge. The fact that she noticed and was upset suggests that she values her friends' privacy and doesn't want her partner interfering. Her calling him controlling and sexist might indicate that he's making assumptions about the intentions of her friends based on their gender, which is a form of sexism. Controlling behavior can manifest in various ways, like monitoring or restricting a partner's social interactions. The author's actions could be seen as controlling because he's trying to manage her friendships to prevent potential issues, rather than trusting her to handle it. However, his intentions are to protect the relationship, which is understandable, but the method might be problematic. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because her autonomy and social connections are important. In healthy relationships, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. The author might need to work on building trust and communication rather than vetting her friends. So, putting it all together, even though his intentions are to protect the relationship, his actions are likely crossing into controlling behavior, making him at least partially at fault. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
