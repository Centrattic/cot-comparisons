Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote about vetting their girlfriend's male friends is in the wrong. The situation is that the author doesn't trust the guy friends, checks them out, and that led to an argument where the girlfriend felt he's controlling and sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of trust in relationships. Trust is a two-way street, right? If the author is feeling insecure, it's understandable, but how he's handling it might be the issue. Vetting someone else's friends without their knowledge could come off as controlling. It's about mutual respect and communication. \n\nThe author mentions he's not threatening but just taking note. However, the fact that the girlfriend found out and felt he was being sexist or controlling suggests that his actions crossed a line. Healthy relationships require transparency. If he had concerns, he should have discussed them with her instead of taking it upon himself to investigate.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend is within her right to have friends of the opposite sex. The author's actions might be based on insecurity rather than actual evidence of the friends being problematic. Trust is important, and without it, a relationship can suffer. The key point here is that the author's actions led to conflict and made her feel controlled. \n\nSo, even if his intentions were to protect the relationship, the method was flawed. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong because his actions were controlling and lacked communication.\n"
