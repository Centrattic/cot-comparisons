Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy vetting his girlfriend's male friends. He's checking them out to see if they have bad intentions towards her. His GF got upset, called him controlling, sexist, paranoid. The question is whether he's an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: he's been with his GF for 8 months, he's not threatening but just \"taking note\" of her male friends. He mentions one guy who seems interested in her. He doesn't trust them and wants to ensure they aren't hitting on her or causing issues. His GF is upset, feeling he's controlling.\n\nIn relationships, trust is a big component. If someone is monitoring their partner's friends without their knowledge, that can be seen as controlling. Even if his intentions are to protect her, doing it without her consent might be crossing a boundary. The GF's reaction is valid because she might feel her freedom is being restricted, and her judgment is being questioned. She's allowed to have friends regardless of gender, and her male friends might be just friends. The act of vetting without discussing it with her could be seen as a breach of trust in the relationship. The guy's behavior might stem from insecurity or jealousy, but that doesn't justify controlling actions. So, the answer is likely AITA because he's overstepping boundaries without her consent and showing a lack of trust in her.\n"
