Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The author explains that he doesn't trust these guys, checks them out, and even got into an argument with his girlfriend, Jenna. She called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is monitoring his girlfriend's male friends without her knowledge, which could be an invasion of her privacy. Trust in a relationship is crucial, and if he's not trusting her, that might be a red flag. Even if his intentions are to protect the relationship, the method of secretly vetting her friends might come off as controlling.\n\nJenna's reaction is valid because she might feel that her autonomy is being respected. If she has the right to have friends, then her partner shouldn't be secretly assessing their intentions. It's about mutual trust. However, the author's concern isn't unfounded if there's a history of issues with her male friends. But the approach taken here is problematic because it's done without her consent.\n\nThe key points are the lack of communication and the secretive nature of his actions. Instead of discussing his concerns openly, he took matters into his own hands, which likely made her feel disrespected. Healthy relationships require transparency and trust. So, while his intentions might be to protect the relationship, the method is controlling and lacks trust, which are valid reasons for her frustration.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because his actions are controlling and breach trust, even if his intentions are good.\n"
