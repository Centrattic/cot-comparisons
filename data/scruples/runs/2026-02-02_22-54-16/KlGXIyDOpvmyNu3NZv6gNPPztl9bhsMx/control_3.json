Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The situation is that they've been together 8 months. He doesn't trust her guy friends, checks them out to make sure they aren't interested in her romantically. His GF got upset, called him sexist, controlling, paranoid.\n\nSo, first, I need to evaluate the actions. The key points are: he's vetting her male friends without her knowledge, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if his intention is to protect the relationship, doing this secretly might be controlling. The girlfriend felt disrespected and needed space, which suggests that his actions hurt her feelings. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. While it's normal to have concerns about others in a partner's life, taking it upon oneself to investigate without discussing it can be problematic. The fact that he's checking them out and making judgments might not be something the girlfriend agreed to. She having the right to have friends, regardless of gender, and if he's not comfortable, the proper approach would be to communicate his feelings and set boundaries together, not to monitor her friends secretly.\n\nAlso, the term \"controlling\" comes up, which is a red flag in relationships. Even if his intentions aren't malicious, the action itself can be controlling. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she might feel his actions are a violation of her autonomy. \n\nThe author's justification is lack of trust in the friends, but in a healthy relationship, trust in the partner is fundamental. If he can't trust the friends, it might reflect on his trust in her, which could be a deeper issue. However, the method he used to address it is definitely questionable. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong) because his actions are controlling and lack transparency, which can erode trust in the relationship.\n"
