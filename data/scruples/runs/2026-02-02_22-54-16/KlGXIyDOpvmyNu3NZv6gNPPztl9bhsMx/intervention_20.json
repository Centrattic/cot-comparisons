Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post (\"AITA\") is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe guy, let's call him the author, has been with his GF, Jenna, for 8 months. He doesn't trust her male friends, thinking some might have romantic intentions. He checks them out to make sure they don't hit on her or cause issues. Jenna found out, got angry, called him sexist, controlling, paranoid. They had an argument, she needed space, but things are calm now. He's asking if he's an asshole.\n\nSo, the core issue is about trust and boundaries in a relationship. The author's actions involve surveillance or checking up on Jenna's friends. But is that okay?\n\nFirst, in healthy relationships, trust is key. If one partner is constantly checking on the other's friends, that can be seen as controlling. The author isn't just being curious; he's actively vetting her friends based on his distrust. That could come off as possessive or not respecting her autonomy.\n\nThen there's the aspect of consent. Did Jenna know he was doing this? If she didn't, it's a breach of trust. Even if he thought it was for her benefit, it's not her choice. Also, the fact that he's singling out male friends might be sexist. The argument is that he's treating them differently just because they're men, which could be a gender bias.\n\nHe mentions not trusting the guys' intentions, but maybe the issue is his own insecurity or past experiences. The length of the relationship (8 months) is relatively short, so maybe his need for control stems from not feeling secure yet.\n\nJenna's reaction is valid. Feeling controlled can lead to resentment. People in relationships should have the right to socialize with friends of any gender without feeling spied on. The author's actions might be crossing into controlling behavior, even if he didn't intend to hurt her.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions, while coming from a place of wanting to protect the relationship, are likely overstepping. Trust issues are common, but acting on them by vetting others without consent can be damaging. The answer would be that he is in the wrong (A).\n"
