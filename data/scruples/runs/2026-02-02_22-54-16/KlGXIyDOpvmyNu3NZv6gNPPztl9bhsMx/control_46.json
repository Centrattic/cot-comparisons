Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this Reddit post is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend, Jenna, have been together 8 months. He doesn't trust her male friends, checks them out, and is concerned about their intentions. He's not threatening but just taking notes. Jenna found out, got upset, called him sexist, controlling, paranoid. They had a conflict, but she's back now. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. From a relationship perspective, trust is a big component. If he's not trusting his girlfriend's friends without a valid reason, that could be seen as controlling or lacking trust. He mentions he's fine with her female friends, which might be a red flag\u2014why the difference? It could imply he's making assumptions about all men, which is sexist. Also, \"vetting\" friends might involve prying or surveillance, which can be invasive. \n\nIn healthy relationships, open communication is key. Instead of secretly vetting her friends, he should discuss his feelings with her. If he's not being open and honest about his insecurities, that's a problem. Jenna's reaction is valid because being vetted without her knowledge can feel like a violation of her privacy and autonomy. \n\nHe claims it's to ensure her safety and the relationship, but his methods are questionable. Trust issues are normal, but acting on them without mutual agreement can be controlling. The fact that he's taking note of them and keeping information from her might be the issue. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The answer is likely A (he's in the wrong). He shouldn't be vetting her friends without discussing it with her first. His actions come off as controlling and sexist, even if his intentions are to protect the relationship. Trust and communication are more important than covert checks.\n"
