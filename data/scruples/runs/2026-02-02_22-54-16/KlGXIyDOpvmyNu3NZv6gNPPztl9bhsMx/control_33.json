Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about the author vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The author is checking out their guy friends to make sure they're not interested in the girlfriend in a romantic way or have bad intentions. The GF got upset, called him sexist, controlling, paranoid, and needed some time alone. Now the author is wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The main issue is the author's actions of \"vetting\" the GF's friends. This involves checking out their intentions, possibly without her knowledge. Trust is a big component here. The author mentions he doesn't trust the male friends, which leads him to do this. But trust is usually mutual in a relationship. If the GF feels that his actions are controlling, there's a problem.\n\nIs it wrong to want to protect the relationship? Well, it's natural to want to protect one's partner, but the method here might be crossing a line. The author is not just expressing his concerns but actively vetting her friends, which could be seen as overstepping. The GF's reaction suggests that she's uncomfortable with this level of interference. She might feel he's not respecting her autonomy or that he's being possessive.\n\nAnother angle: communication. If the author had concerns about her male friends, maybe he should have discussed it with her first instead of vetting them himself. Open communication is key in relationships. By doing the vetting without discussing it with her, he might have undermined her trust in him, making her feel that he doesn't trust her judgment or her ability to choose friends.\n\nAlso, the concept of controlling behavior. If the author is monitoring her friends without her knowledge or consent, that's a red flag. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and trust. The GF's terms of being with female friends but not male ones might indicate she's okay with some boundaries, but the way the author is handling it is causing conflict.\n\nThe term \"paranoid\" from the GF's side suggests that the author's actions might be based on unfounded fears. If there's no actual evidence that the male friends are a threat, then the author's behavior could be seen as irrational. Trusting the partner's judgment is usually important unless there's concrete evidence of a problem.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions might be to protect the relationship, the method of vetting without communication and consent is likely making him controlling and paranoid in the GF's eyes. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because his actions are invasive and lack trust in his partner.\n"
