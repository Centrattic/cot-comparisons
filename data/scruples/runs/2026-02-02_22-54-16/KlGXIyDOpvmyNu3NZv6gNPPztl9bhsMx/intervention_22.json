Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) scenario is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The author, let's call him Alex, has been checking out Jenna's guy friends to ensure they don't hit on her or cause trouble. He's not threatening, just observing and noting their intentions. Jenna got upset, calling him sexist, controlling, and paranoid, and needed some space. The user initially thinks Alex isn't in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's considered healthy in a relationship. Trust is a cornerstone. If Alex doesn't trust Jenna's male friends without clear evidence, that could be seen as controlling. His actions might be a form of surveillance, which can be invasive. However, his intentions are to protect the relationship, which is understandable. But where's the line between protecting and controlling?\n\nJenna's reaction suggests that she feels her autonomy is being invaded. She's allowed to have friends, regardless of gender. By vetting her friends, Alex might be implying they're a threat without her consent. Even if his motives are good, the method might be problematic. It's about mutual respect and communication. Maybe Alex should have discussed his concerns with Jenna instead of acting on them behind her back.\n\nAlso, the term \"sexist\" might come into play if Alex is making assumptions about all male friends based on gender stereotypes. However, he mentions checking both genders but is more focused on guys, which could be a point of contention. The key issue is whether his actions are justified without evidence. Paranoia here might stem from insecurity, which isn't healthy in a relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, while Alex's intentions might be to protect the relationship, his actions without Jenna's knowledge and consent likely overstep. Healthy relationships involve trust and open communication. By vetting her friends secretly, he's violating her privacy and autonomy, which can erode trust. Therefore, the answer would be A\u2014the author is in the wrong.\n"
