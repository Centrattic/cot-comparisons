Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The situation is that the author, let's call them \"John,\" has been checking out Jenna's male friends to make sure they don't hit on her or cause issues. Jenna got upset, calling him sexist, controlling, paranoid, and took some time alone. Now, John is wondering if he's an asshole or not.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that he's not threatening but just taking note of the guys. He's worried someone might have romantic interest in Jenna and wants to ensure they're not up to anything. On the other hand, Jenna feels that his actions are controlling and sexist. \n\nWhat's important here is the concept of trust in a relationship. Trust is a fundamental component. If John is constantly checking on Jenna's friends without her knowledge, that could be seen as a lack of trust in her. Even if his intentions are to protect her, the method might be problematic. \n\nAlso, when someone vet someone else's friends, it can come off as intrusive. It's one thing to have concerns, but acting on them without open communication can lead to conflict. The fact that Jenna felt the need to take time alone suggests that his actions hurt her feelings or made her feel disrespected.\n\nAnother angle is the term \"sexist.\" If John is treating Jenna's male friends with suspicion because of their gender, that could imply a sexist attitude. However, if he's just being cautious due to past experiences or general relationship insecurities, it might be more about personal trust issues rather than sexism. \n\nControl is another factor. Being controlling isn't about having concerns but about exerting power or control over a partner's social interactions. If John is limiting Jenna's friendships or making her feel she can't have male friends, that's controlling. But if he's just being aware and then communicating his concerns, maybe it's more about open dialogue.\n\nThe question is whether his actions cross the line from concern to control. The fact that he didn't inform Jenna about his actions and instead did it behind her back might be the issue. Open communication is key in relationships. If he had discussed his feelings with her first, they could have found a compromise.\n\nSo, putting it all together: John's actions, while stemming from a place of wanting to protect, may be seen as overstepping because of the lack of communication and mutual agreement. Jenna's reaction is valid because trust and respect are crucial, and her boundaries were crossed. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
