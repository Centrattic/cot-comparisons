Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a guy who's been in a relationship with his girlfriend, Jenna, for 8 months. He mentions that she has several male friends, and he doesn't trust them. He says he's checking out these friends to make sure they don't hit on her or lead her to cheat. He's not being threatening, just taking note. There was a guy who seemed interested in her romantically, and he doesn't trust that guy. He's okay with her female friends as long as they don't talk too much about the relationship, but he questions why she's friends with the guys. After some time, his girlfriend found out and got angry, calling him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. They had a fight, and now he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but I need to evaluate it based on the given information.\n\nFirst, let me break down the key points. The author is \"vetting\" his girlfriend's male friends. This implies he's looking into their intentions or background. The girlfriend found out and was upset, leading to the argument. The author's reasoning is that he's trying to protect the relationship by ensuring these friends aren't a threat. He's not being overtly controlling, but he's monitoring them.\n\nIn relationships, trust is a big component. If someone is checking into their partner's friends without their knowledge or consent, that's often seen as a breach of trust. Even if the intention is to protect the relationship, the act of vetting can be considered controlling or invasive. The girlfriend's reaction is that he's sexist, which could imply that he's assuming all male friends have ulterior motives. That's a stereotype, which is problematic because it generalizes all men as potential threats. It's also controlling because he's trying to manage who his partner interacts with based on his own suspicions without discussing it with her first.\n\nThe fact that the author is not threatening but just \"taking note\" doesn't mitigate the issue because the act of secretly vetting someone's friends can be seen as a lack of trust. Healthy relationships require open communication. If the author had concerns about a specific friend, the appropriate approach would be to talk to Jenna about it, not to investigate behind her back. By doing so, he's asserting control without her consent, which is a red flag in relationships.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's feelings of being called out for being sexist might be valid if the author is making assumptions about all male friends based on gender rather than individual behavior. That's a form of gender bias. The author's behavior could indeed be seen as paranoid and controlling, which are traits that can erode trust in a relationship.\n\nAnother angle is the duration of the relationship. Eight months is a significant time, so the author's actions might be more noticeable and impactful by then. If a partner is checking into his friends without discussing it, that would be a problem. The girlfriend's reaction is a clear indication that the author's actions have crossed a boundary she's not comfortable with.\n\nSo, considering all these factors: lack of trust, controlling behavior, potential sexism, not communicating concerns openly, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong. Even if his intentions are to protect the relationship, the method is inappropriate and harmful to the relationship's health.\n"
