Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is about a guy who's checking out his girlfriend's male friends because he doesn't trust them. He's been doing this for 8 months, and it's led to an argument where the girlfriend called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. The guy is wondering if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The guy is \"vetting\" his girlfriend's male friends to ensure they don't hit on her or lead her to cheat. He's not threatening but just observing. The girlfriend is upset and wants space. The question is whether this behavior is justified or controlling.\n\nFrom a general perspective, trust is a cornerstone of a healthy relationship. If one partner is constantly checking on the other's friends, especially in a way that's not communicated, that can be seen as controlling or lacking trust. The guy's actions, even if well-intentioned, might be invading his girlfriend's privacy. Everyone has the right to socialize without being spied on. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she feels her autonomy is being violated.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's making assumptions about the intentions of her friends without discussing it with her adds to the issue. Trust issues are common, but acting on them without communication can harm the relationship. The girlfriend's labeling him as sexist and controlling might stem from feeling that he doesn't respect her ability to manage her own friendships and make her own decisions.\n\nHowever, some might argue that having concerns is normal, especially in a new relationship. But the method of addressing those concerns matters. Instead of secretly vetting her friends, an open conversation about his insecurities would be healthier. The fact that he's been doing this for 8 months without her knowing exacerbates the problem, as it shows a pattern of behavior rather than a one-time issue.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and communication are key. If he can't trust her judgment in choosing friends, that might indicate deeper issues in the relationship. The girlfriend's need for space after the argument shows that his actions caused significant distress. So, while his intentions might be to protect the relationship, the approach is problematic.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his actions are controlling and erode trust, and they haven't been communicated openly. The girlfriend's reaction is a valid response to being monitored without consent.\n"
