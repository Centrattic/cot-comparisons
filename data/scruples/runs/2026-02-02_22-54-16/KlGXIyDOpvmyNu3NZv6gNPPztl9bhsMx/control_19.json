Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. So, the author, let's call him Alex, has been checking out Jenna's guy friends because he doesn't trust them. He's not doing anything threatening, just keeping an eye on them to make sure they don't hit on her or cause problems.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's normal in relationships. Jealousy is common, but how one deals with it matters. Alex isn't confronting the guys directly, just observing. But he's keeping this to himself, not talking to Jenna about his concerns. That might be a problem because communication is key in relationships. If he's worried, he should discuss it with her instead of secretly vetting her friends. \n\nJenna got upset because she felt he was sexist and controlling. She might see his actions as a lack of trust in her. Trust is fundamental in a relationship. If Alex can't trust her judgment in choosing friends, that's a deeper issue. Maybe he's projecting his own insecurities onto her friends. By vetting them, he's implying she might cheat or that her friends have bad intentions, which could be hurtful. \n\nAlso, the fact that Jenna noticed and was upset shows that his actions affected her. Even if his intentions are good, the method is intrusive. It's possible he's overstepping by not being transparent. Controlling behavior often starts with small actions like this, so even if he's not being aggressive, it can still feel controlling to his partner. \n\nOn the other hand, some people might argue that being cautious isn't inherently wrong. But the problem usually comes from how it's handled. If Alex had communicated his concerns instead of acting on them secretly, that might be better. The key point is that Jenna felt disrespected, which is a valid reaction. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because his actions, while stemming from insecurity, were done without communication and made his partner feel controlled and untrusted.\n"
