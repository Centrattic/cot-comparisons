Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The situation is that the couple has been together 8 months. The author doesn't trust the male friends, thinks some might want the girlfriend, and checks them out to prevent them from hitting on her or causing issues. The girlfriend got upset, called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nFirst, maybe the author is overstepping. Trust is important in relationships. If he's checking on her friends without her knowledge, that's a red flag. Even if he's just observing, it's invading her privacy. She has a right to her own social circle. The fact that she's upset about it suggests that his actions are making her feel controlled. \n\nAlso, 8 months is a decent time to build trust. If he can't trust her friends, maybe there's an underlying issue with his own insecurities or jealousy. He's projecting his suspicions onto others. The girlfriend might feel disrespected that he's not trusting her judgment in choosing friends. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say it's natural to be cautious about partner's friends. But the problem is how he's handling it. Vetting without her knowledge or consent is controlling. Healthy relationships require communication. If he had concerns, he should have talked to her instead of doing it behind her back. \n\nSo overall, the author is likely in the wrong because his actions are controlling and lack trust, which are harmful in a relationship. The answer would be A.\n"
