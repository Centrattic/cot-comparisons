Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has been with their girlfriend Jenna for 8 months. He's checking out her male friends, probably by looking into their backgrounds or observing their interactions. His reasoning is that he doesn't trust them, thinking some might have romantic intentions towards Jenna. He isn't threatening but just taking note. However, Jenna found out, got angry, called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid, and needed time alone. They're back together now, but he's questioning if he was wrong.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, trust is crucial. The assumption is that in a healthy relationship, partners trust each other. If he doesn't trust Jenna's male friends without evidence, that might indicate insecurity. But he's not accusing Jenna of cheating; he's preemptively checking on the friends to prevent potential issues. The problem is his actions made Jenna feel controlled and mistrusted. Even if his intentions are good, the method\u2014vetting her friends\u2014could be seen as overstepping. \n\nThe key here is consent and communication. Did he discuss his concerns with Jenna before taking action? If not, then he acted unilaterally, which can be controlling. Trust issues are common, but actions that make a partner feel monitored or distrusted can harm the relationship. \n\nAlso, labeling him as sexist or paranoid might be Jenna's reaction, but if the guy is genuinely worried about other men's intentions, it's more about possessiveness than sexism. However, controlling behavior is typically when one partner tries to manage the other's interactions without their consent. \n\nIn many cases, relationship advice would suggest open communication. If Jenna feels her autonomy is invaded, then his actions are problematic. The fact that she needed time alone shows the conflict's impact. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's actions, while stemming from a place of wanting to protect the relationship, lack the partner's consent and may infringe on her social freedom. This makes him at fault for being controlling, even if his motives are understandable. Therefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
