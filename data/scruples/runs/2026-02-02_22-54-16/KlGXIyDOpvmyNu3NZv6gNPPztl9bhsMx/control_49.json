Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they don't trust their girlfriend's male friends. They check out these guys to make sure they don't hit on her or cause her to cheat. They say they're not threatening but just taking note. The girlfriend got upset, calling them sexist, controlling, and paranoid. The author is asking if they're an asshole.\n\nSo, from a relationship ethics perspective, trust is a big part. If the author is questioning the trustworthiness of their girlfriend's friends, that might indicate a lack of trust in the girlfriend herself. Jealousy or insecurity can lead to controlling behaviors. Vetting friends without the girlfriend's knowledge or consent might be seen as invasive. Even if the author isn't directly threatening, the act of secretly checking on her friends could be considered controlling. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that she feels her privacy is being invaded, and that her friends are being judged without cause. \n\nIs there a valid reason for the author's actions? If the girlfriend has a history of issues with her friends, maybe, but the story doesn't mention that. The author just states a general distrust. In healthy relationships, partners don't need to monitor each other's friends like that. It can create a power imbalance and erode trust. The fact that the author is doing this to their girlfriend but not vice versa might contribute to the controlling aspect.\n\nAlso, the term \"controlling\" is part of what the girlfriend called them, which is a red flag in relationships. Controlling behavior can escalate, so even if the author's intentions are to protect, the method is problematic. The author might need to reflect on whether their actions are based on their own insecurities rather than any real evidence of wrongdoing by the friends.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong. They are overstepping by vetting her friends without her knowledge, leading to a breach of trust and making their partner feel controlled. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
