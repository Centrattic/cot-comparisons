Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The author, let's call him John, has been checking out Jenna's guy friends to ensure they don't hit on her or try to cheat. He's not threatening but just observing. Jenna got angry, calling him sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The key points are that John is checking out Jenna's male friends without her knowledge, which Jenna found out and was upset. The question is whether his actions are justified or not.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, trust is crucial. If John doesn't trust Jenna's friends, that lack of trust might stem from insecurity or fear. However, taking matters into his own hands by vetting them without her consent could be seen as overstepping. Trust issues are common, but the way John handled it might be problematic. \n\nBy \"vetting\" her friends, John is essentially making judgments about people Jenna chooses to be around without discussing it with her. This could come across as controlling because he's not giving her the autonomy to manage her own friendships. Even if his intentions are to protect the relationship, doing so covertly undermines communication and mutual respect. \n\nJenna's reaction highlights that she felt disrespected. Being called sexist and controlling suggests that she perceives his actions as gender-based stereotypes (maybe assuming all male friends have negative intentions) and as an infringement on her social life. The fact that she needed time alone shows the impact of his actions on their relationship.\n\nThe duration of the relationship is 8 months, which is relatively short. In some cases, early relationships can have more intense insecurities, but that doesn't justify controlling behavior. The author's justification is that he wants to ensure the friends aren't \"up to some shit,\" but that's a vague and subjective standard. \n\nAnother angle is that the author isn't physically interfering but just observing. However, the act of secretly vetting friends can erode trust because it implies he doesn't trust Jenna's judgment in choosing her friends. Healthy relationships involve trust and open communication. If John had concerns, he should have discussed them with Jenna instead of taking it upon himself to investigate.\n\nAlso, the mention of one guy being interested in Jenna romantically might be a valid concern, but the solution should be a conversation, not unilateral action. The line between protecting the relationship and being controlling is thin here. John's actions might prevent potential issues, but they also create tension and distrust in their current relationship.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the answer leans towards A, the author is in the wrong. His actions, while stemming from a place of wanting to protect the relationship, are controlling and lack the transparency and communication necessary for a healthy partnership.\n"
