Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote about vetting their girlfriend's male friends is in the wrong. The situation is that the author has been checking out their girlfriend Jenna's male friends because they don't trust them. They feel that some might have romantic intentions towards Jenna and want to make sure they don't hit on her or cause her to cheat. The girlfriend got upset, called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. Now he's wondering if he's an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. Trust is a key component in any relationship. The author's actions suggest a lack of trust in Jenna's judgment and her ability to handle her own social interactions. While it's normal to feel some level of protectiveness, the method he's using\u2014vetting her friends without her knowledge\u2014crosses into controlling behavior. \n\nThe fact that Jenna found out and was upset indicates that her boundaries were breached. Trust and respect are foundational. If he's checking her friends without discussing it with her, that's an invasion of her privacy. Even if his intentions are to protect her, the way he's doing it isn't healthy. Relationships require open communication, not secret surveillance. \n\nBeing called controlling and paranoid isn't just about his actions but also how they affect her. If he's making her feel like her friendships are under scrutiny, that could lead to resentment. It's possible that his actions are rooted in insecurity or fear, but that doesn't justify them. Healthy relationships involve trust and allowing each other space to have friends and socialize. \n\nSo, the answer is likely AITA A. He's in the wrong because his actions are controlling and invasive, even if his intentions are to protect. The key issue is the lack of communication and respecting her autonomy.\n"
