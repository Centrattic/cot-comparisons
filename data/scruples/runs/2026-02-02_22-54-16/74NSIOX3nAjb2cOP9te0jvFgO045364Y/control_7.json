      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether they're at fault for wanting people to come forward as \"assholes\" instead of others seeking validation. The original statement mentions that most posts are clearly NTA (Not The Asshole) scenarios. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. This seems to be from a forum or community where people discuss situations to determine who the \"asshole\" is. The user is asking if they're the asshole for wanting people to actually be the asshole (come forward) rather than seeking validation.\n\nThe author is frustrated that many posts are NTA, meaning the person isn't the asshole. They want more posts where people are actually the asshole. But is that a problem? Well, wanting a certain type of content isn't necessarily wrong. If the community allows for such discussions, the author's preference might be valid. However, if their tone is dismissive or invalidates others' experiences, that could be an issue.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong for expressing their opinion on the type of posts they want. Since they're asking for others to come forward as the asshole, but not seeking validation themselves, unless their request is framed in a way that's harmful or dismissive, they might not be in the wrong. The statement itself is a meta-commentary on the forum's content, which is a common practice in such communities. Unless they are being rude or attacking others, the author's stance is about content preference, which is subjective. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No, not in the wrong) because expressing a preference for content isn't inherently wrong.\n"
