      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the statement is in the wrong. The original question is \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation? Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\" The user thinks the author is not in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what AITA means. It's \"Am I the Asshole?\" which is a common Reddit thread where people ask if they're the bad guy in a situation. The author is suggesting that many of these posts are NTA (Not the Asshole), meaning the person isn't the one at fault. They're probably tired of seeing people just looking for validation and not actually being the asshole in their stories.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is wrong to feel that way. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user's own opinion is B, but they want confirmation. \n\nI should consider the context. The author is critiquing the trend in AITA posts where people are not actually the asshole. This could be a valid concern because if the posts are mostly NTA, it might indicate that the community is being too lenient or that people are using the platform to vent rather than genuinely seek advice. However, the author's tone might come off as dismissive or judgmental, which could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nBut the core question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting the posters to actually be the asshole. Since the author is expressing a preference for the community, it's their opinion. Unless they made a specific harmful statement, just wanting the posts to be valid might not be wrong. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They're allowed to have their own standards for the content they engage with.\n"
