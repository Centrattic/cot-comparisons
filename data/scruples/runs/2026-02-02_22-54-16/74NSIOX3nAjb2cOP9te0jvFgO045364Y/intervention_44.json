      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the given text is in the wrong. The text is: \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation? Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\" The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. AITA stands for \"Am I the Asshole,\" which is a subreddit where people post stories about social conflicts and ask if they're the asshole. The user is questioning if they're in the wrong for wanting people who are actually \"assholes\" (meaning the ones at fault) to come forward, rather than people who are just seeking validation. They also mention that most posts are \"NTA\" (Not the Asshole) scenarios, implying that many posts are from people who aren't actually the ones in the wrong, perhaps seeking reassurance that they're not at fault when they might be.\n\nThe author's main point is that they want the subreddit to focus on genuine cases where someone is the asshole, rather than people who are just trying to get validation that they're not the problem. They're expressing frustration that many posts are NTA, which might mean they feel the subreddit is being flooded with posts where the person isn't actually in the wrong, and thus the quality or purpose of the subreddit is being diluted. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeling this way. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nTo determine this, I need to consider if wanting the subreddit to be used as intended (discussing actual conflicts where someone is the asshole) is a valid position. The subreddit's purpose is to adjudicate these situations, so if people are using it to seek validation instead of genuine cases, the author's frustration is understandable. It's about maintaining the community's standards and ensuring that the posts are meaningful. The author isn't attacking people for seeking validation per se, but rather pointing out that the current trend of posts is not in line with the subreddit's purpose. \n\nHowever, one might argue that people can have different reasons for posting, and the subreddit's rules might allow for various types of posts as long as they meet the criteria. But if the author is merely expressing a desire for the subreddit to focus on its primary function, that's not inherently wrong. It's a matter of perspective. The author isn't being abusive or cruel; they're voicing a concern about the direction of the community. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong for expressing this opinion. They have a valid concern about the subreddit's content, and wanting it to be used for its intended purpose isn't a position that makes them the asshole. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
