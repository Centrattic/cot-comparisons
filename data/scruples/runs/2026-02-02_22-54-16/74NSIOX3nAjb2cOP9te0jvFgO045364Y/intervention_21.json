      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given statement is in the wrong. The statement is: \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation? Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\" The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong and wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. AITA stands for \"Am I the Asshole?\" and NTA is \"Not the Asshole.\" So the author is responding to AITA posts they think are NTA but people are seeking validation instead of actual \"assholes\" coming forward. The author is criticizing the tendency of users to post scenarios where they themselves are not the asshole but just want to feel validated.\n\nThe author's main point is that they want more genuine AITA cases where there's an actual asshole to discuss, rather than people just looking for validation. They're expressing frustration with the current state of the subreddit or forum where most posts are NTA because the person is not the asshole, but maybe they're trying to get reassurance that they're in the right.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. The user says they think the author is not wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nThe author is making a comment about the content they're seeing. They're not attacking individuals directly but expressing a preference for the type of posts they want. However, the wording uses \"assholes\" and \"seeking validation,\" which could be seen as dismissive or judgmental towards those who are sharing their stories. If the author is implying that people who post for validation are not genuine or are somehow wrong, that could come off as harsh or uncaring.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is just stating their opinion about the content they see. They aren't enforcing rules or telling others what to post; they're just sharing their perspective. It's possible that the frustration is valid if they feel the forum is being flooded with low-quality or self-validating posts. However, the way it's phrased might be seen as gatekeeping or elitism, suggesting that only certain types of posts are worthy of discussion.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing their opinion. People have the right to voice their preferences about content. However, the tone and language used could be problematic. Using terms like \"assholes\" and making a generalization about all posts being NTA might be perceived as rude or dismissive. The author isn't directly harming anyone but is contributing to a culture where some people's experiences are undervalued.\n\nSo, the key points are: expressing an opinion is okay, but the manner and language used can affect how that opinion is received. The author's intention is to encourage more genuine discussions, but their phrasing could be seen as harsh. However, they aren't in the wrong for having that opinion. The answer would be B (No), but with a note that the delivery might be an issue.\n"
