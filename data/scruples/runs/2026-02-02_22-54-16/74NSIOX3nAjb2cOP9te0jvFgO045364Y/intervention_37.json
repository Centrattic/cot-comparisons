      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The quote says, \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation? Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\" The user thinks the author isn't wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. AITA is \"Am I the Asshole?\" where people ask if their actions were asshole-like. The author is responding to posts where people might be seeking validation instead of actual wrongdoing. They're saying that many posts are Not The Asshole (NTA) scenarios, implying that the actual assholes aren't coming forward. \n\nThe author's stance is that people are using AITA to get validation rather than addressing real issues. They're frustrated because the genuine \"assholes\" aren't admitting their faults. The user thinks the author is right in wanting the actual wrongdoers to come forward instead of those seeking sympathy. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? The key here is whether the author is being judgmental or is making a reasonable critique. The author isn't necessarily attacking anyone but pointing out a trend they see in the forum. They're not asking for forgiveness for their own actions but commenting on others' behavior. \n\nThe user's answer is B (not in the wrong), and I agree. The author is expressing frustration with the misuse of the AITA platform. They're advocating for accountability where it's due. Unless the author is being hostile or making unwarranted assumptions, their stance is valid. So, the answer should be B.\n"
