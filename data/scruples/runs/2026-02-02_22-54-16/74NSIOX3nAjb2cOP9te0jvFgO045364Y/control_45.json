      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of a certain statement is in the wrong. The statement is: \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation? Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\" The options are A for yes (author is wrong) and B for no (author isn't wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. AITA stands for \"Am I the Asshole?\" which is a subreddit where people ask if they're the asshole in a given situation. NTA means \"Not the Asshole,\" meaning the person isn't the asshole in their story.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole for wanting people who are actually the asshole (the \"assholes\") to come forward instead of people who are just seeking validation. They're also saying most posts are clearly NTA. So the author is frustrated because they think many posts are from people who aren't the asshole but are just looking for reassurance or validation, rather than the actual asshole coming forward to admit their faults.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user is asking for an answer between A and B. \n\nI need to consider if wanting people who are the actual offender to come forward is a valid stance. In AITA scenarios, typically, the poster is asking if they're the one at fault. However, in some cases, people might be seeking validation when they're not the one in the wrong. The author is criticizing this, saying that most posts are NTA and that they want the actual offenders to come forward. \n\nIs it wrong to want that? Well, if the author is advocating for accountability and for the people who are actually in the wrong to take responsibility, that seems reasonable. However, if the author is dismissing others' valid concerns or invalidating their need for support, that could be problematic. But based on the statement alone, the author is expressing frustration with the trend of non-asshole posts seeking validation, not necessarily attacking others. \n\nSo, the author's stance is that they don't want to see people seeking validation when they're not the asshole. They want the actual asshole to come forward. That's a common critique in AITA communities, where some users feel that too many posts are from people who are clearly not the problem and are just looking for reassurance. The author isn't saying others are wrong, but rather that they want a different type of post. \n\nTherefore, the author is not necessarily in the wrong. They're expressing a preference for the types of posts they see. Unless they are being abusive or attacking others, their stance seems valid. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
