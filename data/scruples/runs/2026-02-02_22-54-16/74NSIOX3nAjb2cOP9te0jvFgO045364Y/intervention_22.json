      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the given statement is in the wrong. The statement is: \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation? Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\" The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. \"AITA\" stands for \"Am I the Asshole?\" which is a subreddit where people post situations and ask if they're the asshole. \"NTA\" is \"Not the Asshole,\" meaning the person isn't at fault. So the author is criticizing the current trend of posts where the situations are clearly NTA, but people are still posting for validation instead of actual conflicts where someone is being an asshole.\n\nThe author is frustrated that most posts are about scenarios where the person isn't in the wrong, so they're not real AITA cases. They want people to actually have real conflicts to discuss. Is the author in the wrong for wanting that? Well, the subreddit's purpose is to discuss if someone is the asshole. If people are posting situations where there's no actual conflict (all NTA), maybe the author is just pointing out that the subreddit is being misused for validation rather than genuine questions.\n\nBut does that make the author the asshole? The author isn't attacking anyone personally, just expressing frustration with the trend. The question is whether the author is wrong for wanting people to follow the subreddit's intended purpose. Since the subreddit exists for people to ask if they're the asshole, and if others are just using it for validation, the author's desire for more appropriate posts isn't inherently wrong. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
