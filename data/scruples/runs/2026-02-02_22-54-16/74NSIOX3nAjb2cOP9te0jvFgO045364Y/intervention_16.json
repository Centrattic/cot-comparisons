      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user provided a quote where the author is asking if they're at fault for wanting people who are actually \"assholes\" to come forward instead of people just seeking validation. They mention that most posts are NTA (Not The Asshole) scenarios these days.\n\nFirst, I should understand the context. This seems like a discussion from a forum or a community where people submit situations to determine who the asshole is. The author is frustrated because they feel like the posts they're seeing are not actually cases where someone is clearly in the wrong (NTA) but rather situations where people are seeking validation. The author is pushing back against that, wanting actual asshole scenarios to be the focus.\n\nNow, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user's own opinion is that the author is not in the wrong but wants to know if I agree.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics of such forums. These communities often have guidelines to determine if someone is the asshole. If the author is criticizing the trend of NTA posts, maybe they're frustrated that the community isn't engaging with more clear-cut cases. But is it fair to say the author is wrong for wanting those clear cases? It depends on perspective. If the community is evolving, maybe the author's stance is a valid critique. But if the community is just reflecting the real-world complexity of situations, then maybe the author is being too rigid.\n\nAnother angle: the author's tone. They use \"assholes\" and mention people seeking validation, which could be seen as dismissive. However, if the author is genuinely interested in discussing actual wrongdoing and not just minor issues, their stance isn't inherently wrong. It's about whether their criticism is justified.\n\nAlso, the phrase \"NTA scenarios\" implies that the community is leaning towards not assigning blame in many cases. The author wants more accountability, which could be seen as a positive, but if they're invalidating others' experiences, that's a problem. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong for expressing that preference.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is expressing a valid opinion and isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting more clear-cut cases. Their frustration might be valid if they feel the community is becoming too lenient. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
