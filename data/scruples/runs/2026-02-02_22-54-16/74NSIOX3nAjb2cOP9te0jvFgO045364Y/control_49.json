      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on their statement. The author says, \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation? Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\" So, they're questioning if they're the asshole for wanting people who are actually in the wrong (assholes) to come forward instead of people who are just seeking validation. They also mention that most posts are NTA (Not The Asshole) scenarios.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. AITA posts are typically on forums where people share situations and ask if they're the asshole. The community then votes or comments. The author is frustrated because they feel like the posts they see are not really cases where someone is the asshole, but rather people just wanting validation. The author wants more genuine \"asshole\" scenarios to be brought forward.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). The user is asking if the author's stance is valid or not.\n\nThe key here is to determine if the author's desire for more authentic AITA cases, where someone is clearly the asshole, makes them the asshole. The author isn't directly attacking anyone but is expressing a preference for the type of posts they want to see. They're not dismissing others' experiences but are commenting on the perceived lack of genuine asshole scenarios.\n\nIn terms of the AITA framework, the community often has norms about what constitutes a valid post. If the author's frustration stems from a belief that some posts don't meet the criteria (e.g., they're seeking validation rather than an actual conflict), then their criticism is about the community's content rather than attacking individuals. \n\nHowever, the author's tone could be seen as dismissive if they're implying that people seeking validation shouldn't post, which might invalidate others' experiences. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author isn't making a personal attack but is stating a preference for the type of content they want to see. \n\nIn AITA contexts, the community often encourages genuine situations where there's a clear moral dilemma. If the author is advocating for that, then they're not wrong. However, if their comment comes off as belittling others' posts, that could be an issue. The original statement doesn't explicitly belittle but rather expresses a desire for different content. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting more authentic AITA cases. They're participating in the community by setting their expectations, which is a common thing in forums. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
