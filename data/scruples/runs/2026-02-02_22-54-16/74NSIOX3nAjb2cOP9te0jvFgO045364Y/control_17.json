      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The question is about whether it's a \"terrible\" act (AITA) to want people who are \"assholes\" to come forward rather than others seeking validation. The author mentions that most posts are just NTA (Not the Asshole) scenarios.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. AITA threads typically involve people sharing situations where they've done something questionable and asking if they're the asshole. The author here is expressing frustration that many of these posts are actually cases where the person isn't the asshole, but the situation is being mischaracterized. The key point is the author's desire for the actual \"assholes\" to be held accountable instead of people who are just seeking validation.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). The author's stance seems to be that they think people are misusing AITA threads by not actually being the one at fault but still posting for attention or validation. This could be seen as a critique of the forum's current trend rather than a direct accusation against someone. \n\nHowever, the phrase \"wanting assholes to actually come forward\" might imply that the author is dismissing the validity of people's situations. If someone is genuinely in a dilemma and seeks advice, even if they believe they might be the asshole, the author's comment could be perceived as judgmental or dismissive. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is pointing out a pattern where the majority of posts don't fit the \"asshole\" criteria. This could be a valid observation if the community is indeed flooded with posts where the person is not the asshole. In that case, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing that viewpoint. \n\nBut the problem is the tone and the implication that those seeking validation are not legitimate. The AITA format is about self-reflection and community judgment. If the author is suggesting that people shouldn't post unless they are clearly the asshole, that might be restrictive. However, if they're simply observing a trend, that's not directly their fault. \n\nWait, the original question is phrased as \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation?\" So the author is asking if they're the asshole for wanting the actual wrongdoers to be the ones posting, rather than those who are seeking validation. The author's position is that they don't want people to misuse the forum by not actually being in the wrong. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author is correct in their assessment. If the majority of posts are indeed NTA, then the author's desire for accountability isn't the problem. But if they're dismissing legitimate cases where people are unsure if they're in the wrong, that could be an issue. However, the author isn't necessarily saying that all posts are invalid, just that many are NTA. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for expressing that opinion. The answer should be B.\n"
