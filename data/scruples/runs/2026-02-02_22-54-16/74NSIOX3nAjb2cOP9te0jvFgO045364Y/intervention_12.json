      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the given statement is in the wrong. The statement is: \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation? Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\" The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The original poster (OP) is asking if they're the asshole for wanting people who are actually in the wrong (\"assholes\") to come forward, rather than people just seeking validation. They mention that most posts are NTA (Not The Asshole) scenarios. So, the OP is frustrated that they think many situations aren't actually AITA cases because the wrongdoers aren't admitting their faults, and instead, the posters are just looking for validation.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider the tone and intent here. The OP is expressing a desire for more genuine cases where actual wrongdoing is acknowledged, rather than situations where people are just seeking validation. The use of \"assholes\" is informal, but the main point is about the authenticity of the scenarios. \n\nIs there any inherent wrongness in wanting people to take responsibility? The author isn't attacking others but is critical of what they perceive as insincere posts. However, they might be dismissive of others' genuine concerns if those situations don't meet their criteria. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding that opinion.\n\nIn AITA discussions, people often have different perspectives on what constitutes wrongdoing. The author's stance could be seen as valid if they're frustrated by what they see as misuse of the AITA format. However, the author might be assuming that many posters aren't seeking validation when they could still have legitimate issues. But without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe key is that the author isn't directly harming anyone; they're expressing an opinion about the content of the posts. Unless they're being malicious, they might not be in the wrong. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, and I can see that reasoning. The author's frustration is understandable in a community where quality of posts is important. So, the answer would likely be B (No).\n"
