      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given statement is in the wrong. The statement is: \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation? Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. AITA stands for \"Am I the Asshole?\" which is a subreddit where people ask if they're the asshole in a situation. NTA means \"Not the Asshole,\" so the author is saying that most posts are NTA scenarios. The author is frustrated because they want people who are actually the assholes (i.e., the wrongdoers) to come forward, rather than people just seeking validation.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nThe author is expressing frustration with the trend of posts, not making a direct claim about being the asshole themselves. They're not necessarily being an asshole by wanting more genuine cases. It's a meta-comment on the subreddit's content. \n\nIs there any reason to think the author is in the wrong? Well, if they're dismissing others' posts as seeking validation without considering the actual situations, that could be seen as dismissive. But the author isn't attacking anyone personally; they're just expressing a desire for different content. \n\nIn AITA discussions, people often have strong opinions, but the key is whether the author's statement itself is asshole-like. Since they're not directly involved in a situation but are critiquing the trend, it's more about their opinion. Unless they're being abusive, it's probably not being an asshole. \n\nSo the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong.\n"
