      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given statement is in the wrong. The question is about whether they should be blamed (AITA) for wanting people to come forward as \"assholes\" instead of seeking validation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The original statement is from someone who's frustrated with how many AITA posts are really NTA (Not the A**hole) because the person is clearly in the right. The author wants people to actually admit they're the a**hole instead of just trying to get validation. \n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe AITA subreddit is a place where people ask if they're the a**hole in a situation, and others comment. The term \"NTA\" means the person isn't the a**hole, while \"YTA\" means they are. Sometimes people post scenarios that are clearly NTA just to get upvotes or validation, which can frustrate others who feel the subreddit is being misused. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. They want genuine discussions where people are willing to admit fault rather than seeking approval. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for expressing this frustration. \n\nThe author isn't doing anything harmful; they're expressing an opinion about the platform's content. Unless they're making personal attacks or violating community guidelines, their frustration is a valid opinion. So, they aren't in the wrong for wanting more authentic posts. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
