      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting people to actually come forward instead of just seeking validation. The original question is \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation?\" and the author's response is \"Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\" The user thinks the author is not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. AITA is \"Am I the Asshole?\" and NTA is \"Not the Asshole.\" So the author is commenting on AITA posts, saying that many of them are not really NTA but people just looking for validation. They're frustrated that people are using the forum to get approval instead of actually addressing if they were in the wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for expressing this opinion.\n\nThe user's argument is that the author is not in the wrong, and I should agree or not. The options are A or B. The key here is whether the author's frustration is justified. On one hand, maybe they're being elitist or judgmental. On the other, they're pointing out a trend they observe in the community. The author isn't attacking individuals but making a general observation. \n\nBut wait, are they implying that others are wrong for seeking validation? That could be seen as dismissive. However, AITA is a community where people come to ask if they're the asshole. If the author is arguing that many people aren't actually the asshole (NTA) because they're just wanting validation, that's a common critique. Some people might think the community has become too quick to label situations as NTA, or that posters are not being genuine. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for expressing this? It's a matter of opinion. They're not necessarily being rude or attacking someone personally. They're voicing a concern about the trend. Unless they're being mean or using harsh language, it's just their perspective. So the answer would be B, No, the author is not in the wrong. They're sharing an opinion, not committing an action that's objectively wrong.\n"
