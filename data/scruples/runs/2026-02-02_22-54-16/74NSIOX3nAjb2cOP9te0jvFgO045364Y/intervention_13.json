      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given statement is in the wrong. The statement is: \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation? Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\" The user thinks the author is not in the wrong and wants to know if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. AITA stands for \"Am I the Asshole?\" which is a subreddit where people post about conflicts and ask if they are the asshole. NTA means \"Not the Asshole,\" indicating the poster isn't the one at fault. The author is questioning if they're wrong for wanting the \"assholes\" to come forward rather than people just seeking validation. They also mention that most posts are NTA, implying that maybe the posters aren't actually at fault and are just looking for support.\n\nSo, the author's main point is about wanting more genuine AITA scenarios where someone is actually the asshole, rather than posts where the person is just looking for validation and the situation is clearly NTA. They might be frustrated with the subreddit's current trend of posts that don't fit the typical AITA mold.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for expressing that frustration? Well, the question is phrased as \"AITA for wanting...\" which is a meta question about their own stance. The key here is whether wanting others to come forward as the asshole is a valid critique. The user argues the author isn't in the wrong, and I should see if that's the case.\n\nIn the AITA format, the expectation is that the poster might be the asshole, and the community discusses it. If most posts are NTA, the author is just commenting on the dynamics they observe. They aren't necessarily being judgmental about the specific situations but are instead suggesting a preference for more balanced or contentious posts. \n\nHowever, maybe they're dismissing valid posts where people are genuinely seeking advice and not just validation. The problem here is that some might see the author as being dismissive of people who are using the subreddit for emotional support rather than conflict resolution. But the author is expressing a desire for the community to focus on actual AITA cases. \n\nIs it fair to want the subreddit to maintain its original purpose? The user's answer is B, that the author isn't in the wrong. I think that makes sense because the author is just voicing an opinion about the content they want, not directly attacking anyone. Unless they're being rude or invalidating others' experiences, but the statement itself is a question about their own stance. So the answer should be B.\n"
