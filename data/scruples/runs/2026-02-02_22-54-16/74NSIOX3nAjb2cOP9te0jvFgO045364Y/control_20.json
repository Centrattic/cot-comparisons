      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the given statement. The statement is: \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation? Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. AITA stands for \"Am I the Asshole?\" which is a subreddit where people post about their situations to get others' opinions on whether they're the asshole. The user is questioning if they're in the wrong for wanting people to come forward as \"assholes\" instead of seeking validation. They also mention that many posts are NTA (Not the Asshole), which means the person isn't the asshole in their scenario.\n\nThe author's complaint seems to be that they're tired of posts where people are just seeking validation rather than actually being in the wrong. They want more scenarios where the person is clearly the asshole. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeling this way.\n\nI need to consider if wanting more \"asshole\" scenarios is a valid opinion. The AITA subreddit is for people to get feedback on their actions, and it's possible that the user is frustrated with the current trend of posts. However, the subreddit allows for various opinions, and users can choose which posts to engage with. The author isn't directly causing harm by expressing their opinion; they're just sharing their preference. \n\nIs there any wrongdoing here? The author isn't attacking anyone, just stating a desire for more NTA scenarios. People have the right to prefer certain content over others. So, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for having this opinion.\n"
