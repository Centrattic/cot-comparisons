      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting people to actually come forward instead of seeking validation. The original statement mentions that most posts are NTA (Not The Asshole) scenarios. The author is frustrated with people using the platform to get validation rather than genuinely confronting someone's asshole behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) posts. Typically, these are situations where someone shares a story to get others to judge if they're the asshole. The user here is tired of posts where the person is just looking for confirmation that they're not the asshole, maybe without actually addressing the issue with the other person.\n\nThe author argues that instead of these validation-seeking posts, people should confront the \"assholes\" directly. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeling this way. \n\nIs there a problem with wanting others to take responsibility? The author isn't saying they shouldn't post about their issues, but that the approach is ineffective. They want people to engage with the person they're having a problem with instead of just getting online validation. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe some people don't have the option to confront the person directly\u2014maybe it's a work environment, or a toxic relationship, or they're just not in a position to do so. The author's frustration is valid, but does that make them in the wrong? They're not attacking anyone, just expressing a desire for more proactive behavior. \n\nI think the key here is that the author isn't wrong to want people to take action. They might be dismissive of others' need for validation, but the main point is about encouraging direct engagement. Since the author isn't being malicious, just expressing an opinion, they're probably not in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
