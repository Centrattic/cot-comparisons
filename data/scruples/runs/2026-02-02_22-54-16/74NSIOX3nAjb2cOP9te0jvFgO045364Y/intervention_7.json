      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given statement is in the wrong. The statement is from someone on a platform like Reddit's AITA (Am I the Asshole) subreddit. The author says they're not in the wrong for wanting people who are actually being assholes to come forward instead of others just seeking validation. They also mention that most posts are NTA (Not The Asshole) scenarios.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. AITA threads typically involve people sharing their stories to get others to judge if they're the asshole. The original poster (OP) is frustrated that many posts they see are clearly NTA, implying that the people being called out aren't actually the problem. The OP wants more genuine cases where the person is actually the asshole, rather than people just trying to get validation or sympathy.\n\nThe user's question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeling this way. The options are A (Yes, they are wrong) or B (No, they are not wrong). The user provided their own thought that the author isn't in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nNow, considering the reasoning. The key point is the author's frustration with what they perceive as low-quality or insincere posts. They want the subreddit to have more valid cases. Is it wrong to have that opinion? Well, everyone has the right to their opinion. However, the question is about moral wrongdoing, not just disagreement. The author isn't making a harmful statement; they're expressing a preference for more authentic interactions. Even if they're dismissive of others' posts, unless they're being abusive, it's not necessarily wrong. They're not attacking anyone personally, just expressing frustration with the content quality.\n\nIn AITA discussions, people often have strong opinions about each other's scenarios. The author isn't claiming to be the asshole but is commenting on the community's content. Since they're not engaging in harmful behavior but just sharing their perspective, they're likely not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
