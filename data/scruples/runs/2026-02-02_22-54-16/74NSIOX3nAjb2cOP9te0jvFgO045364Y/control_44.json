      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given statement is in the wrong. The statement is: \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation? Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\" They want a response with either A or B, where A means the author is in the wrong and B means they're not.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The phrase \"AITA\" stands for \"Am I the Asshole?\" which is a common question on online forums like Reddit. People post situations asking if they're the asshole. The author here is responding to a scenario where they feel most posts are NTA (Not the Asshole), meaning the person isn't at fault, but the author is arguing that people are just seeking validation instead of actual \"assholes\" coming forward.\n\nSo the author is criticizing the posts for not being real cases where someone is the asshole, suggesting that many are NTA when they should be AITA. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for this opinion.\n\nTo determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider if their criticism is justified. The author isn't directly attacking someone but is expressing frustration with the trend of posts. They want more genuine \"asshole\" scenarios. Since they're not making a personal attack but stating their opinion on the content, it's subjective but not inherently wrong. Unless there's a rule against such comments, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
