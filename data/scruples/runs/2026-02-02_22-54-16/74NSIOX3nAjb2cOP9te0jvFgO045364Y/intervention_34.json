      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the given statement is in the wrong. The statement is: \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation? Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\" The user thinks the author is not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. AITA stands for \"Am I the Asshole?\" which is a subreddit where people ask if they're the asshole in their situations. NTA means \"Not the Asshole.\" So the author is commenting on the current state of AITA posts, suggesting that many of them are clearly NTA cases rather than the person being the asshole. They're expressing frustration that people are using the platform to seek validation instead of genuinely questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nThe author's point is that they want actual \"assholes\" to come forward, implying that many posts are from people who aren't actually in the wrong but are just fishing for reassurance. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for making this statement.\n\nNow, considering the tone and intent. The author is making an observation about the trend in posts, not attacking individuals. They're not saying people are bad for seeking validation; they're pointing out a pattern they've noticed. The frustration is with the misuse of the platform, not the people using it. So, if someone is expressing an opinion about how they perceive the community's use, it's generally their right to do so. Unless they're attacking others or being toxic, they aren't in the wrong for voicing their perspective.\n\nThere's no evidence of the author being disrespectful or making personal attacks. They're just stating their opinion that some posts are NTA and that they'd prefer more genuine AITA cases. The phrasing \"assholes to actually come forward\" is a bit strong, but in the context of the AITA subreddit, it's a common way to refer to the person being in the wrong. So, it's a matter of opinion, and the author isn't wrong for sharing that view.\n"
