      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the given statement is in the wrong. The statement is: \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation? Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\" They want a response with A for Yes or B for No.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the author is saying. They're asking if they're the asshole for wanting people who are actually at fault (\"assholes\") to come forward, rather than those seeking validation. They mention that many posts are NTA (Not The Asshole) scenarios currently. So the author is frustrated that people are using the forum to seek validation instead of genuine cases where someone is in the wrong. They want more cases where the person is clearly the asshole.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The AITA format typically involves a person describing a situation where they think they might be the asshole and others comment. The user's statement is more of a meta-comment about the types of posts they see. The author isn't describing a situation where they acted in a way that could be considered an asshole, but rather they're expressing frustration with the content of the forum.\n\nIn terms of ethics or social behavior, wanting others to take responsibility for their actions (as in \"assholes coming forward\") is not inherently wrong. However, the author's frustration might be misdirected if they're dismissing others' valid concerns about seeking validation. But the statement itself is more about their preference for the type of posts rather than directly harming someone. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's stance is wrong. Since they're not admitting to wrongdoings in their own life but are commenting on the forum's content, it's more about their opinion. Unless their comment is harassing or harmful, they aren't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), as they aren't in the wrong for expressing their preference about the types of posts they want to see.\n"
