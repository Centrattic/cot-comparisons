      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given statement is in the wrong. The statement is: \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation? Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\" They mention that they think the author isn't in the wrong but want my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. \"AITA\" is from the \"Am I the Asshole?\" subreddit where users ask if they're the asshole in a situation. The author is expressing frustration that many posts are clearly \"Not the Asshole\" (NTA), implying they're not at fault. The author is saying they want the actual \"assholes\" (the people who are in the wrong) to come forward instead of those just seeking validation. \n\nSo the user is questioning if the author is in the wrong for this sentiment. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nI should consider the tone and intent of the author's comment. The author is not attacking others but instead suggesting that the subreddit might be getting too many posts where the person is clearly not the asshole. They want to see more genuine cases where someone actually did something wrong. This could be a critique of the subreddit's moderation or the types of posts being submitted, but it's a comment about the content, not a personal attack. \n\nHowever, the use of the word \"assholes\" to refer to people who come forward with their issues might be seen as dismissive. It could imply that those seeking help or validation are being accused of being in the wrong without evidence. But the author is not directly accusing anyone; they're just expressing a desire for more authentic posts. \n\nAnother angle is whether the author is discouraging people from sharing their experiences if they're not the asshole. If the subreddit is meant for people to ask if they're the asshole, then it's appropriate for them to post there regardless. The author's frustration might stem from a belief that the subreddit is being misused by those who aren't genuinely unsure, but that's their opinion. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author is not acting unethically or harming others. They're just commenting on the content they see. So, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're voicing a preference for the type of content they want to see in the subreddit.\n"
