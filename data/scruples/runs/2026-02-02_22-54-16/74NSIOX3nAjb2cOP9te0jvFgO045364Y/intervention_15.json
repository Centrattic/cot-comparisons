The author is expressing frustration that many posts are obvious \"Not the Asshole\" (NTA) scenarios and wants people to actually come forward with the real issues instead of just seeking validation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context of AITA posts. They're typically where someone asks if they're the asshole in a situation, and the community votes (NTA, YTA, etc.). The author here is criticizing the trend of posts that are clearly NTA, implying that people are using the platform to seek validation rather than address real problems. \n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to determine if the author's frustration is justified. The key point is whether the author is wrong for wanting more genuine cases. The author isn't saying others are wrong for posting NTA scenarios, but is expressing a desire for more substantive contributions. \n\nIs there a wrongdoing here? The author is voicing an opinion about the quality of posts, not attacking individuals. They're not being malicious, just critical of the trend. In online communities, it's common for people to express such frustrations, especially if they feel the platform is losing its purpose. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Their frustration is about the perceived trend, not a specific action that's unethical or harmful. So the answer should be B.\n"
