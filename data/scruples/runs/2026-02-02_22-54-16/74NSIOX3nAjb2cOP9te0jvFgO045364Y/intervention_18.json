      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the given statement is in the wrong. The statement is: \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation? Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\" The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to parse what the author is saying. They're questioning if they're the asshole for wanting people who are actually at fault (\"assholes\") to come forward, rather than people just seeking validation. The \"NTA\" refers to \"Not the Asshole,\" so they're saying most posts are NTA, implying that people are using AITA (Am I the Asshole) threads to get validation that they aren't the asshole, even when they might be.\n\nThe author is expressing frustration with the trend in AITA posts where people might not actually be in the wrong but are still posting to confirm their perspective. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for this sentiment.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, wanting people to be honest and actually at fault before making a post doesn't seem inherently wrong. The AITA subreddit is meant for people to share situations where they're unsure if they did something wrong. If the author is frustrated that some users aren't truly in the wrong and are just seeking validation, that's a critique of the community's usage rather than a personal wrongdoing.\n\nThe key here is the author's intention. They're not attacking specific individuals but commenting on a pattern. The phrase \"assholes\" is used in the context of people who are at fault, so the author isn't being derogatory without cause; they're using the subreddit's own terminology. The author's stance is about the integrity of the subreddit's purpose.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing a desire for more genuine posts where the person is actually in the wrong. They're advocating for the subreddit to stay true to its original intent. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
