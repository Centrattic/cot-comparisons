      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The original statement is from someone asking if they're a \"tit for tat\" (AITA) for wanting people who are being assholes to come forward instead of others just seeking validation. They mention that most posts are NTA (Not The Asshole) scenarios now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. In AITA posts, people usually describe a situation where they and others are at fault, and the community votes on who's the asshole. The user is frustrated that many posts end up being NTA, meaning no one is the asshole, and they want more posts where someone is clearly in the wrong. They're annoyed that people are using these posts to seek validation instead of actual conflicts where there's a clear asshole.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A or B. So, is the author wrong for wanting more posts where actual assholes are involved? Well, the user is expressing a preference for the type of content they see. They're not doing anything harmful; they're just voicing their opinion about the current state of the subreddit. Wanting more clear-cut cases where someone is at fault isn't inherently wrong. It's a critique of the content, not an action that harms others. Unless they're being rude or dismissive of others' experiences, which isn't indicated here, they're just sharing their perspective.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They're expressing a valid opinion about the content they prefer. So the answer should be B.\n"
