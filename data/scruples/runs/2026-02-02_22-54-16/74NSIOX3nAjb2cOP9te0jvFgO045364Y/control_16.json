The text says, \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation? Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse what this means. AITA stands for \"Am I the Asshole?\" which is a common Reddit community where people ask if they're the asshole in a situation. The author is asking if they're the asshole for wanting people who are actually at fault (the \"assholes\") to come forward, instead of people who are just seeking validation. They also mention that most posts are NTA (Not the Asshole) scenarios.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nThe author's main point is that they want the actual people who did something wrong to admit it, rather than people who are just looking for reassurance. They're criticizing the current trend of posts where the person is not the asshole. But is the author in the wrong for expressing this opinion?\n\nIn the AITA subreddit, the dynamic is about people sharing their stories and the community deciding if they're the asshole. The author's frustration is with the perceived shift in the types of posts. They're not saying that people shouldn't post there, but that they want more situations where the poster is actually the asshole. \n\nIs there anything inherently wrong with wanting that? The author isn't attacking others, just expressing a preference. Unless they're being dismissive or rude in their criticism, which the text doesn't show. The text is a question of whether their stance makes them the asshole. \n\nSo, in this case, the author's opinion is a valid critique of the subreddit's content. Unless their comment is harmful or inconsiderate, which it doesn't seem to be, they're not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
