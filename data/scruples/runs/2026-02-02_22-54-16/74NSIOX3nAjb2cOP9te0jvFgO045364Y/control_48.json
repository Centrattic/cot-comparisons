The statement is asking if they're the asshole for wanting people to actually come forward instead of seeking validation, and mentions that most posts are NTA (Not the Asshole). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. These types of questions usually come from online forums where people share stories and ask for opinions. The user is frustrated that many posts are clearly NTA, meaning the person telling the story isn't the asshole. The author is expressing a desire for people to actually be assholes (i.e., come forward as ATAs) instead of just seeking validation where they aren't the asshole.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for feeling this way. The options are A (yes, they're wrong) or B (no, they're not). \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable if they feel the community is skewed towards NTA posts, which might lead to a lack of genuine discussion. Wanting more ATAs to come forward isn't inherently wrong. It's a preference, not a harmful action. The person isn't attacking others but expressing a desire for more accountability in the posts. There's no evidence that the author is being malicious here. So, the answer would likely be B, they're not in the wrong. They're voicing an opinion about the content they see online.\n"
