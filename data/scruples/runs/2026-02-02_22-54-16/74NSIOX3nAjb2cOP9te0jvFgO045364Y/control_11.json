      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given statement is in the wrong. The statement is: \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation? Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\" They want a yes or no answer based on the context.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is questioning if they're at fault for preferring that people who are actually wrong (assholes) come forward rather than those just seeking validation. They mention that most posts are NTA (Not the AITA), which implies they feel many posts are from people who aren't in the wrong but are still seeking attention or validation.\n\nThe key here is the author's intent. They're expressing frustration that the forum is being used more by people who aren't actually the ones at fault, which might be making the community less effective for its original purpose. The question is whether this frustration makes them in the wrong.\n\nIn AITA threads, the goal is to have users ask if they're in the wrong. The author is saying they want the people who are actually wrong (assholes) to be the ones asking, not those who are NTA. This could be seen as a valid critique of the forum's usage, not necessarily a personal attack. The author isn't attacking individuals but pointing out a trend. Their frustration is about the misuse of the platform, which could be a legitimate concern. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong; they're expressing a valid opinion about the forum's dynamics. So the answer should be B.\n"
