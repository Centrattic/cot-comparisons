      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given statement is in the wrong. The statement is: \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation? Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\" The user thinks the author is not in the wrong and wants to know if they agree.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the context. The author is responding to situations where people post questions on platforms like Reddit's AITA (Am I the Asshole) subreddit. They're criticizing that most posts are NTA (Not the Asshole) scenarios, implying that people aren't actually assholes but are seeking validation instead. The author is asking if they're the asshole for wanting people to come forward honestly rather than just seeking approval.\n\nNow, considering the options: A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). The user argues the author isn't wrong. I need to evaluate the reasoning.\n\nIn AITA posts, people typically ask if they're in the wrong. If the author is frustrated that many posts are NTA because they perceive the questioner as not being the real asshole but instead looking for validation, that's a critique of the posts' quality or intent. The author isn't doing anything harmful themselves; they're expressing an opinion about the content. The frustration is about the perceived inauthenticity of the posters. \n\nIs it wrong to want people to be honest in their posts? The author isn't attacking anyone personally but making a general comment about the trend. Unless the author is being dismissive of others' genuine issues, which isn't indicated here, their stance seems valid. People can have different standards for what constitutes a valid AITA post. The author's desire for more authenticity isn't inherently wrong. Therefore, B seems correct. The author is not in the wrong for expressing their perspective, even if it's a critique.\n"
