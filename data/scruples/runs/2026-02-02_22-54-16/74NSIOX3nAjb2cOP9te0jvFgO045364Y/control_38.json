      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking about a specific situation where the author says they don't want \"assholes\" to come forward but rather people seeking validation. They mention that most posts are obviously NTA (Not The Asshole) scenarios. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong, with options A or B.\n\nFirst, I should understand the context. The author is responding to situations where people might be using an online platform, perhaps a forum or Reddit, to argue about who the \"asshole\" is in a conflict. The author is frustrated because they think the majority of these posts are just clear NTA cases (meaning the person isn't the asshole), and they feel that people are seeking validation instead of actual \"assholes\" coming forward. \n\nSo the key points here are: the author is not in the wrong if they're advocating for only genuine cases of being an asshole to be addressed, rather than people using it as a way to get sympathy or validation. The author might be tired of seeing posts where the situation is clearly not the person's fault, and they want the platform to focus on real issues. However, the problem is whether the author is in the wrong for expressing this sentiment.\n\nI need to consider if the author's frustration is valid. If they're saying that most posts are NTA, which means they think the people posting are not the ones in the wrong, then the author might be pointing out that these are not valid \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) posts because the person isn't the asshole. The author is pushing for people to actually be in the wrong (i.e., be the asshole) before they post, rather than just seeking reassurance that they're not wrong.\n\nIs the author wrong for wanting more accountability? If the platform's purpose is to have people who are unsure if they're the asshole get feedback, then the author is just suggesting that people who are clearly not the asshole shouldn't post there. That's reasonable. However, if the author is dismissing cases where people are genuinely unsure and just want validation that they're not wrong, maybe that's not the right approach. But the author isn't saying they can't post; they're saying they want more actual \"assholes\" to come forward. \n\nI think the author's stance is valid. They're not in the wrong for wanting the community to focus on legitimate cases. It's about curating the content to be relevant. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
