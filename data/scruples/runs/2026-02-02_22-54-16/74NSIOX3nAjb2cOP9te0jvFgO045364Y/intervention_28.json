      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The original statement is: \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation? Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\" The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. AITA is \"Am I the Asshole?\" a forum where people ask if they're the asshole in a situation. The author is questioning why so many posts are NTA (Not the Asshole) when they think the scenarios are clear NTA. They're frustrated that people are seeking validation instead of the \"assholes\" coming forward.\n\nThe user is saying the author isn't wrong. I need to decide between A (Yes, wrong) or B (No, not wrong). The author is expressing frustration with the trend of posts that they perceive as not actually being AITA cases. They want the people who are in the wrong to come forward, implying that the current posts are not real AITA situations because they're clear NTA. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? The author is making a judgment about others' posts, which might not be their place. However, they're expressing an opinion, not necessarily attacking anyone. The AITA community can sometimes be biased towards NTA, so the author's frustration could be valid. But if they're dismissing others' posts without understanding their context, that could be problematic. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. The author is not directly attacking people but commenting on a pattern they see. They're not the one in a situation where they need to be judged, just expressing their opinion about the forum's content. So, maybe they're not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
