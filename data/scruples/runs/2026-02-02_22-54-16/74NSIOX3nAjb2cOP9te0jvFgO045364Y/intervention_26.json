      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the statement is in the wrong. The statement is: \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation? Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\" The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author is expressing frustration that many posts are NTA (Not The Asshole), implying they think the people in those situations aren't at fault. They want people who are actually wrong (assholes) to speak up instead of those seeking validation. \n\nThe key here is whether wanting people to be responsible and not just seek validation is a valid stance. The author isn't attacking anyone directly but is commenting on a pattern they observe in discussions. They're advocating for accountability, which is a reasonable perspective. \n\nHowever, using the term \"assholes\" might be seen as dismissive or harsh, but the context suggests it's part of their frustration with the trend of posts. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since they're expressing an opinion without directly harming others, it's more about differing viewpoints. \n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) forums, people share stories, and others judge. The author is commenting on the content, not attacking individuals. Their opinion is that too many aren't actually wrong, so they want more genuine cases. That's a valid critique, though others might see it as judgmental. But without evidence of malicious intent, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
