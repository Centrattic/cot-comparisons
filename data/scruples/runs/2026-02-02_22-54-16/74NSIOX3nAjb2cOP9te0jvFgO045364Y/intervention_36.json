      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given statement is in the wrong. The statement is: \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation? Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\" The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong and wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the context. The question is about whether the author is at fault for wanting people who are actually at fault (\"assholes\") to come forward, rather than those seeking validation. The author is criticizing posts they believe are Not The Asshole (NTA) scenarios, implying that many posts are being incorrectly labeled as NTA when they should be AITA (Am I the Asshole).\n\nThe key here is understanding the dynamics of AITA posts. Typically, the person asking if they're the asshole is the one seeking validation, but the author is suggesting that more often, the actual \"assholes\" are the ones coming forward. This could imply that the author is frustrated with the trend of people using AITA posts to validate their own actions, while the real issue is the behavior of others.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The author's statement is a critique of the current state of AITA posts. They're not making a claim about their own actions but rather expressing an opinion about others' posts. There's no direct accusation of wrongdoing against themselves in the statement. They're pointing out a perceived trend where people are using the platform to seek validation, possibly leading to incorrect NTA conclusions.\n\nThe question is whether this critique is valid or if the author is wrong. Since the author is not making a claim about their own actions but commenting on others' posts, they aren't in a position to be in the wrong here. It's a matter of opinion about the platform's usage. Unless there's a specific rule they're breaking or a personal fault they're claiming, the author is simply voicing a perspective. Therefore, they aren't in the wrong for expressing this view.\n"
