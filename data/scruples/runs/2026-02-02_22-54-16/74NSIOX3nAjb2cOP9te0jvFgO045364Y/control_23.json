The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for their question about seeking validation versus people actually being assholes.\n\nFirst, the question is phrased as \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation?\" The author is frustrated that many posts they see are \"obviously NTA\" (Not The Asshole), implying they think the posters are seeking validation rather than genuinely being wronged.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about the author's intent and the context. They're not making a personal attack but expressing frustration with the trend in posts. The question is about whether their stance is wrong. \n\nSince the author is voicing an opinion about the content of posts (too many seeking validation), without attacking individuals, it's a critique of the situation rather than a personal wrongdoing. There's no clear evidence that the author is being malicious or incorrect in their observation. They might have a valid point about the community's dynamics.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're expressing an opinion on the content's quality, not acting wrongfully.\n"
