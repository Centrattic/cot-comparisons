      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the given statement is in the wrong. The statement is: \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation? Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse what the author is saying. The person is questioning if they're the asshole (AITA) for wanting people who are actually at fault (\"assholes\") to come forward, instead of people who are just seeking validation. They also mention that most posts are NTA (Not The Asshole) scenarios.\n\nIn the AITA context, which is a common format on Reddit, people ask if they're the asshole in a situation. The community then discusses and votes on whether the person is the asshole or not. The categories are usually AITA, NTA, Everyone Sucks (ETS), or Other.\n\nSo the author is expressing frustration that many posts are from people who aren't actually in the wrong (NTA) and are instead seeking validation for their actions. They want more posts where the person is actually the asshole (ITA) and needs to come forward. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for this stance. The key here is to determine if their desire for more ITA cases and less validation-seeking is a valid opinion. \n\nIn these kinds of discussions, it's often subjective. The AITA community typically encourages a variety of posts, including both ITA and NTA scenarios. Users have different perspectives, and wanting a certain type of content isn't inherently wrong. The author isn't directly harming anyone; they're just expressing a preference. \n\nHowever, if the author is dismissing valid NTA cases or belittling those who are genuinely seeking advice, even if they're not the asshole, that might be a problem. But based on the given statement alone, the author is just stating a preference for more ITA cases and less validation-seeking behavior. \n\nSo, unless the author is being rude or invalidating others' experiences, their opinion is just a personal take. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No, they're not in the wrong) because it's a matter of personal opinion and content preference, not a harmful action.\n"
