      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is asking whether the person who wrote the given statement is at fault. The statement is: \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation? Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\" The possible answers are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. This is likely from a Reddit thread or a similar platform where people post questions like \"Am I the asshole?\" (AITA). The author is responding to others, possibly in a thread where many posts are being labeled as \"Not the Asshole\" (NTA). The author is expressing frustration that people are using these platforms to seek validation rather than genuinely coming forward with problematic situations.\n\nThe key here is the author's tone and intent. They're criticizing others for not being real \"assholes\" and for seeking validation, implying that the system is being abused. The question is whether this criticism makes the author in the wrong.\n\nIn these AITA scenarios, the community often debates whether the person posting is in the wrong. The author here is not posting their own story but commenting on others' posts. Their frustration is about the perceived misuse of the platform. The problem might be that the author is being dismissive or rude, but if they're just expressing an opinion, maybe not. However, if they're attacking others without justification, that could be an issue.\n\nThe phrase \"assholes to actually come forward\" might be a bit harsh, but it's a common term in these threads. The author is suggesting that many posts are not legitimate and are just people wanting validation. Whether that's true depends on the actual content of the posts they're referring to. If they're making a generalization without evidence, that could be problematic. But if they've seen multiple examples of NTA scenarios, their comment is valid feedback.\n\nAlso, the use of \"obviously NTA scenarios\" might be seen as gatekeeping, implying that others are wrong in their judgments. However, in these communities, there's often debate over what constitutes a \"real\" AITA situation. The author's stance is that they want genuine cases, so they're not necessarily in the wrong for expressing that desire.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is expressing frustration, but unless they're directly attacking someone or being malicious, their comment is a valid opinion. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because they're voicing a common sentiment in such communities without directly harming others.\n"
