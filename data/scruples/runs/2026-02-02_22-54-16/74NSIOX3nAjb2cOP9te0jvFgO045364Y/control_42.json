      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether they're at fault for wanting people to come forward instead of seeking validation. The original statement mentions that most posts are \"obviously NTA scenarios,\" which I think stands for \"Not The Asshole.\" \n\nSo the author is saying they don't want people just seeking validation; they want actual \"assholes\" to come forward. The context here is probably a forum or a social media platform where people post about conflicts and others vote on whether the person is the asshole. The user is frustrated because they're seeing a lot of posts that aren't valid NTA cases, maybe people trying to get sympathy or validation instead of genuine problems.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for feeling this way. To decide, I need to consider if their frustration is justified. If the platform is being misused with fake NTA posts, then wanting to filter out those and have real issues addressed makes sense. But if the author is being dismissive of others' valid experiences just because they don't fit the mold, that could be the problem. \n\nHowever, the author isn't attacking people seeking validation directly; they're expressing a desire for more genuine cases. There's no evidence here that the author is being cruel or invalidating others for seeking support. It's more about their preference for the platform's use. So unless there's a rule against this kind of frustration expression, the author isn't necessarily wrong. Their stance is about the community's quality, not attacking individuals. So answer B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
