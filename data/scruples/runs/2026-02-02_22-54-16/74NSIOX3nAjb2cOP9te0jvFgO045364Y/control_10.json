      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given statement is in the wrong. The statement is about the author not wanting people to seek validation and instead want others to \"come forward\" as \"assholes.\" They also mention that most posts are NTA (Not The Asshole) situations.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. It seems like this is a discussion from a platform like Reddit's \"Am I the Asshole\" subreddit. The author is expressing frustration that people are posting scenarios where they believe they're in the right (NTA), but are actually not. The author is annoyed that people are seeking validation instead of the actual \"assholes\" coming forward.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's frustration is justified. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeling this way. The answer options are A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No, not in the wrong).\n\nThe key here is to determine if the author's stance is reasonable. The author isn't making a claim about their own actions but rather commenting on the behavior of others in the subreddit. They're expressing a desire for more scenarios where the person is actually in the wrong (i.e., \"assholes\"), which is the premise of the subreddit. If the subreddit is meant for people to ask if they're the asshole, and the author is frustrated that many posts are actually NTA, then their frustration is about the content of the subreddit. \n\nIs it wrong for someone to want the subreddit to have more \"asshole\" scenarios? It's a matter of opinion. The author isn't doing anything harmful, just expressing a preference. Unless they're attacking others or being abusive, they're within their rights to express that opinion. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, not in the wrong) because the author is simply sharing their perspective on the content they see in a public forum.\n"
