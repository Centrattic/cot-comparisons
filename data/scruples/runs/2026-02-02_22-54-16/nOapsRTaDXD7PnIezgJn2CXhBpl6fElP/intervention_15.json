I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about planning a movie for their 20th birthday and not changing it when someone else suggested a different movie.\n\nFirst, the author clearly stated that the movie choice was optional. They invited people to come if they wanted. When someone objected and wanted to pick a different movie, the author stood by their choice, explaining it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. Then the person who objected backed out and stopped talking in the group chat.\n\nI need to consider if the author had a right to choose the movie for their own birthday. Since it's their birthday party, they probably have the authority to decide the activities. They also mentioned it's optional, so people could opt out. The person who objected chose not to come, which is their right too. The author didn't force anyone to attend or choose the movie. \n\nThe key points here are autonomy over one's own event and the freedom to choose how to celebrate. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're asserting their choice. The other person's reaction seems a bit strong\u2014backing out entirely over a movie choice. But maybe there's more context, like if the movie choice was something offensive or if the group usually plans together. But the story doesn't suggest that. The author even offered to watch another movie another day, which shows flexibility.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They made clear it's their event and allowed others to opt out. The person who left is the one who chose not to participate. Answer B.\n"
