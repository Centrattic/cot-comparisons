I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about choosing a movie for their birthday and not changing it when someone else suggested a different one.\n\nFirst, the author planned their own birthday movie watching. They posted in a group chat and invited others, making it clear it's optional. Most people agreed, but one person wanted a different movie. The author stood by their choice, and that person left the group chat.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author made it optional for others to join, they communicated their preference upfront, and they were respectful in their response. The person who left didn't like the choice but the author wasn't obligated to change their plan since it's their birthday. The others who came were okay with it, so the main issue is with the one person who left. \n\nI don't see the author doing anything wrong. They had the right to choose their movie for their own celebration. The other person might have been upset, but they were free to not attend. The author didn't force anyone to come. So, the answer should be B.\n"
