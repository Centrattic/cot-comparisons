I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about choosing a movie for their birthday and someone else objecting and then not showing up.\n\nFirst, the author clearly stated it was their birthday party/gift to themselves. They mentioned the movie was optional for others to join. They invited the group, said it's optional, and when someone suggested changing the movie, they explained it's their choice for their birthday. The person who objected then decided not to come. \n\nSo, key points: The author had the right to choose the movie for their own birthday. They made it clear participation was optional. The other person chose to not attend, which is their prerogative. The author didn't force anyone to come or to watch the movie. \n\nIs the author wrong? If someone else wanted to watch a different movie, maybe they expected a group choice, but the author didn't frame it as a group decision. The author set boundaries. The person who left might have had different expectations, but the author wasn't obligated to change their plans for someone else's preference. \n\nPossible angles: Maybe the author could have considered others' preferences more, but since it was their birthday, personal choice is valid. Also, the other person could have attended the movie and suggested another time for a different film. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the person whose event it is usually has the final say. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
