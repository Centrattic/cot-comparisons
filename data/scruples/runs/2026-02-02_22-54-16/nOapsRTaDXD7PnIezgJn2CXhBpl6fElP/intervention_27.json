I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. The situation is that they wanted to watch How to Train Your Dragon 3, invited friends, and when someone suggested a different movie, they refused and the friend didn't come. The writer is wondering if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, the key points: It's the writer's birthday, they chose the movie, made it clear it's optional to join, most people agreed. Then one person wanted a different movie, the writer said no, and that person left. The writer's reasoning is that it's their birthday, they wanted to see that movie, and others could join another time.\n\nI need to consider if the writer did something wrong. The person was specific about it being their birthday and their choice. They didn't force anyone to come, just invited. The friend who wanted a different movie might have been expecting the group to agree on a movie, but the writer was clear it's their choice. The writer's response was polite, offering another time. The friend's reaction was to not come, which is their choice. \n\nIs the writer in the wrong? Probably not. They're celebrating their own birthday, made the event optional, and stood by their choice. The friend may have felt left out, but the writer didn't force them to attend. The problem might be the friend's reaction, not the writer's decision. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
