I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and someone else objecting and not showing up.\n\nFirst, the author organized a birthday movie outing. They invited others via group chat and made it clear the movie was optional. Most people agreed, but one person suggested picking a different movie. The author stood by their choice, explaining it's their birthday and they really wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3. The person who objected then said they wouldn't come and stopped participating in the group chat.\n\nNow, the key points here: The author made it optional for others to join. They chose the movie for their own birthday, which is a personal choice. The person who objected had the option to not come but instead tried to change the author's decision. When the author refused, they decided not to attend. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't force anyone to come. They communicated their choice clearly. The objecting person might have felt their preference wasn't respected, but the author had the right to choose their own celebration. The others agreed, so the majority was on the author's side. The one person who didn't like it could have just not come without pushing for a change. \n\nThe author's response was respectful, explaining their stance. They even offered to watch another movie another time but for this birthday, they wanted HTTYD3. It seems fair for someone's birthday to have some autonomy in planning. The person who left the group chat might be overreacting, expecting their preference to override the birthday person's choice. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
