I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is the asshole for not changing the movie choice. The situation is that they wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their birthday and invited friends. One person suggested changing the movie, the author refused, and then that person didn't come and stopped talking.\n\nFirst, the author made it clear it was optional for others to join. They didn't force anyone to come. When someone suggested a different movie, the author stood by their choice, which is their right since it's their birthday. The person who suggested changing the movie didn't get their way and left. \n\nThe key points are: the author didn't make attendance mandatory, communicated the movie choice in advance, and offered to watch another movie another time. The other person's reaction seems a bit extreme since the author was firm but polite. It's possible that the other person had different preferences or felt snubbed, but the author wasn't wrong in sticking to their choice for their own celebration. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They had the right to choose their movie for their birthday party. The responsibility for not attending lies with the other person, not the author. So the answer is B.\n"
