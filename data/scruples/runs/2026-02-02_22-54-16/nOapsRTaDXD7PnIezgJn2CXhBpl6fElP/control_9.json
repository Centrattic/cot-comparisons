I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday party and some friends not showing up because they wanted a different one.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The person wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their 20th birthday. They posted in a group chat with the time and asked if others wanted to join, making it clear it's optional. Most agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author stood their ground, explaining it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. The other person then backed out and stopped participating.\n\nSo, key points: It was the author's birthday, they made it optional, communicated their choice clearly, and the friend didn't like it. The author didn't force anyone to come; they just wanted to watch the movie they chose. The friend's reaction was to not attend and withdraw from the group chat.\n\nI should consider if the author was inconsiderate. They did mention it's optional, so others weren't obligated to come. The friend's issue seems to be about the movie choice, but the author had the right to choose for their own event. Maybe the friend expected the movie to be chosen democratically, but the author didn't present it that way. However, since it was their birthday, they have the autonomy to decide.\n\nAlso, the friend didn't come up with an alternative or compromise; they just wanted a different movie. The author offered to watch another movie another time, which was a good gesture. The friend's response was to not attend, which is their choice, but doesn't necessarily make the author wrong.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They made their intentions clear, kept the event optional, and were respectful. The friend's disappointment doesn't override the author's right to choose for their own celebration.\n"
