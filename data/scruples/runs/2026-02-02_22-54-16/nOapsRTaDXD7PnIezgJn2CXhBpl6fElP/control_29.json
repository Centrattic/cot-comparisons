I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. They wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3, posted in a group chat, said it's optional. Most people agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author refused, explaining it's their birthday and they wanted that movie, and the person who suggested it then backed out and stopped talking.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The user made it clear it's optional for others to join. They chose a movie for their own birthday, which is their right. The other person wanted to pick a different one, but the user didn't have to agree. The user didn't force anyone to come; they just invited them. The person who backed out might have been expecting the user to change their choice, but the user stood by their decision. \n\nIn social situations, respecting people's boundaries and preferences is important. Since the user made it optional and clear it's their choice, they aren't in the wrong. The other person might be sensitive or have different preferences, but that doesn't make the user the asshole. The user isn't at fault here. Answer B.\n"
