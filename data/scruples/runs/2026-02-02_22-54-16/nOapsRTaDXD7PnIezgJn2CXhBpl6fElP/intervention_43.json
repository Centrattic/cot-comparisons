I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. The situation is that they invited friends to a movie, specified it was optional, most agreed, but one person wanted a different movie. The author stood their ground, and the person left the group chat.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the author's ownership of their own birthday celebration. It's their special day, so they have the right to choose the activity. They also mentioned it's optional, so friends knew they didn't have to come if they didn't like the choice. The person who objected had the option to opt out but instead tried to change the author's choice and then left. That seems a bit childish. \n\nThe author was firm but polite, explaining they could have another movie another time. The others agreed, so only one person took offense. The person's reaction of not coming and stopping communication might be overreacting. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that they liked the movie because it's good. There's no indication they were being unreasonable or selfish. They made it clear it was optional, so friends who didn't want to go could just skip it. The one person's behavior seems to be the issue here, not the author's decision. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They had the right to choose their celebration, and the other person's response was their own choice. Answer B.\n"
