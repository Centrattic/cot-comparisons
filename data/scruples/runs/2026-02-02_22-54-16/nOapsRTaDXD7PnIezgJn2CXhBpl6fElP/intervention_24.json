I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about choosing a movie for their birthday and not changing it despite one person's objection, leading to that person not coming.\n\nFirst, the author planned their birthday movie and invited the group. They made it clear it's optional. Most people agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author stood by their choice, explaining it's their birthday. The person then backed out. \n\nI need to consider if the author was wrong to not change the movie. The key points are: it's the author's birthday, they made it optional, communicated their preference, and the group mostly agreed. The one person's objection led to them not attending, but the author didn't force anyone. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on whether the person's actions were unreasonable. Here, the author had the right to choose their own birthday activity. They didn't pressure others to attend. The other person's decision to leave was their choice. The author didn't act inconsiderately beyond explaining their preference. So, the answer is likely B, not in the wrong.\n"
