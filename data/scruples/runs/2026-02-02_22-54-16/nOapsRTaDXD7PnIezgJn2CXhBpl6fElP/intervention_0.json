I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about choosing a movie for their birthday and some friends not showing up because of it.\n\nFirst, the user posted in a group chat about seeing How to Train Your Dragon 3 as their birthday movie. They mentioned it's optional for others to join. The majority agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author stood their ground, and the friend backed out. Now the author is unsure if they should have changed the movie.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The key points here are that the author made it clear it was their birthday and they chose the movie, and attendance was optional. The friend who objected didn't come, but others did. The author didn't force anyone to come, just expressed their preference. \n\nThe friend's reaction seems a bit dramatic, but the author wasn't obligated to change the movie. They even offered to watch another movie another day. It was their choice to prioritize their own preferences for their birthday. The friend's decision to stop talking in the group chat might be their issue, not the author's. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They were clear, optional attendance, and respected others' choices. The friend is the one who left. So the answer should be B.\n"
