I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and someone else getting upset and not showing up.\n\nFirst, the person planned to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their 20th birthday. They posted in a group chat, saying it's optional if others want to join. Most people agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author stood by their choice, explaining it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. The person who suggested another movie then backed out and stopped participating.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author is wrong. The key points here are: it was the author's birthday, they made it clear the movie was their choice and others weren't obligated to come. The friend wanted a different movie but then chose not to attend. The author didn't force anyone to come; they just invited people. The friend's reaction seems to be about not getting their way, which might be their own issue. The author had the right to choose their own birthday activity. So the answer is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
