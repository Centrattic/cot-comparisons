I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their 20th birthday party and the reactions from friends.\n\nFirst, the person organized the movie night as their birthday celebration. They posted the movie choice and time, emphasizing that it's optional. Most friends agreed, but one person suggested changing the movie. The author stood by their choice, explaining it's their birthday and they really wanted to watch How to Train Your Dragon 3. The other person then decided not to attend and stopped communicating.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy and social dynamics. The author had the right to choose their own birthday activity. They made it clear participation was optional, so those who didn't want to come were free to leave. The friend's frustration might stem from not getting their way, but the author wasn't obligated to change their preference. However, maybe the friend felt ignored or not considered, but the author did offer an alternative (watching another movie another day). \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, it's important to respect others' preferences, but the author is within their rights to prioritize their own birthday plans. The friend's reaction is harsh, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They communicated clearly and compromised by suggesting another viewing day. So, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
