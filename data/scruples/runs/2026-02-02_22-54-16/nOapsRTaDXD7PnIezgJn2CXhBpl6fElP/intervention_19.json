I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who made the post is in the wrong for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday.\n\nSo, the situation is: the person wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their birthday. They posted in a group chat, mentioned it's optional for others to join. Most agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author stood by their choice, saying it's their birthday and they really want to see that movie. The person who suggested a different movie then decided not to come and stopped chatting.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, the author clearly stated it was their birthday and that they chose the movie. They made it optional, so others weren't obligated to come. When someone wanted a different movie, the author refused, which is their right on their own celebration. The other person then backed out, which might be their choice too. \n\nIs the author wrong for not changing the movie? Well, it's their birthday, so they have the right to make the choice. They also offered an alternative (another movie on another day), which shows they were considerate. The problem might be that the other person expected the author to change their plans, but the author wasn't required to. The other person's reaction of not coming and stopping communication could be their own issue, perhaps overreacting. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
