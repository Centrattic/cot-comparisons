I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. The situation is that they invited friends to a movie, specified it's optional, and when one person suggested a different movie, the author declined and the friend pulled out.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the author's ownership of the choice and the optional nature of the invite. The author made it clear it's their birthday and they chose the movie. The friend wanted a different movie, but the author stood by their choice. The friend then decided not to attend. \n\nThe question is whether the author did something wrong by not changing the movie. The author's actions seem reasonable because they had the right to choose their own celebration. The friend's reaction might be more about their discomfort with the choice rather than the author's fault. The author also offered an alternative (another day for a different movie), which shows consideration. \n\nThe friend's response of stopping communication in the group chat might indicate they felt slighted, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author was wrong. The original invite was optional, so the author wasn't obligated to accommodate everyone's preferences. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on whether the person acted unreasonably or without consideration. Here, the author considered the friend's suggestion but ultimately prioritized their own wishes, which is acceptable. The friend's withdrawal is their own choice. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
