I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not changing the movie choice for their birthday. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author planned to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their 20th birthday, posted in a group chat inviting others to join, and most agreed. Then one person suggested a different movie. The author explained it was their birthday and they wanted that movie, offering to watch another time. The person then backed out and stopped participating.\n\nThe author is now questioning if they should have changed the movie. The user thinks the author is in the right. Let me analyze the key points.\n\nThe author made it clear it was their birthday celebration and had the final say on the movie choice. They even offered flexibility for another movie another day. The person who objected chose not to attend, which is their right. The author didn't force anyone to come. \n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone hosts their own event, like a birthday, they usually have the authority to decide the plans. The group agreed initially, so the objection came later. The person who wanted a different movie might have felt their preference wasn't considered, but since the author had already stated it was their choice, there's a case for the author not being in the wrong. \n\nPossible angles where the author might be at fault: Did they give enough notice? Did they consider others' preferences? But they said it was optional and most people agreed. The one person who objected left, which is their choice. The author didn't coerce anyone.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have checked for movie preferences beforehand. But since it's their birthday, it's reasonable to prioritize their choice. Also, the person who left might be being hypersensitive or expecting the group to accommodate their preference over the host's choice.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They made their intentions clear, it was optional, and the person who left did so voluntarily. The answer should be B.\n"
