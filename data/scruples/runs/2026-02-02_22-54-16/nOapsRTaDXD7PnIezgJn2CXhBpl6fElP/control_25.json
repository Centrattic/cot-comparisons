I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their 20th birthday and some friends suggesting a different one.\n\nFirst, the person set up the movie as their birthday party, posted on a group chat, said it's optional. Most agreed, but one friend wanted to change it. The author refused, explaining it's their choice, and the friend then didn't attend.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author was wrong for not changing the movie. The key points here are autonomy and social dynamics. The birthday is their celebration, so they have the right to choose the movie. They also made it clear it's optional, so others aren't obligated to attend if they disagree. The friend who wanted a different movie might have felt their preference wasn't valued, but the author didn't force anyone to come. \n\nThe friend's reaction of leaving the group chat after the author refused to change the movie might indicate that the friend wasn't comfortable proceeding with the chosen movie. However, the author isn't at fault for standing by their preference, especially since they already stated it's optional. \n\nIn typical social scenarios, it's common for the birthday person to set the plans unless there's a significant conflict. Since the author wasn't pressuring others and others could opt out, they aren't in the wrong. The friend's choice to not attend is their responsibility, not the author's.\n"
