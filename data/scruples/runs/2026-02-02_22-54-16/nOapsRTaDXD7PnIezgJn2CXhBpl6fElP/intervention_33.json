I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and not changing it even when a friend suggested picking a different one.\n\nFirst, the author clearly stated it's their birthday and they wanted to see a specific movie. They made it optional for others to join, so people could come or not. When someone asked to change the movie, the author explained it's their choice for their birthday and suggested another day for another movie. The friend then left, which is their choice.\n\nThe key points here are that the author was explicit about it being their birthday movie, and they gave others the option to participate. It's their right to choose how they celebrate their own birthday. The friend had the option to not attend if they didn't agree, which they did. There's no coercion here. The author didn't force anyone to come. So, it seems like the author isn't in the wrong. The friend's reaction might be overreacting, but the author isn't at fault.\n"
