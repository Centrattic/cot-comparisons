I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person asked if they're the asshole for not changing the movie for their birthday. They wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3, posted in a group chat, and most people agreed. But one person suggested a different movie. The author stood their ground, saying it's their birthday and they really wanted that movie. The person who suggested another movie then backed out and stopped talking.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author was wrong to stick with their choice. The user is asking if they're at fault. The key points here are: the author was clear it was their birthday and they chose the movie, others were optional to join. The one person who objected ended up not coming. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. It's their birthday, they had the right to choose the celebration as they wanted. They even offered to see another movie another day, which shows they were considerate. The person who objected might have felt their preference wasn't respected, but the author made it clear it was their choice. Since others agreed and only one person objected and left, the author isn't the asshole. The answer should be B.\n"
