I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and not changing it despite a friend suggesting otherwise.\n\nFirst, the author invited friends to a movie, made it clear it was optional, and mentioned it was their birthday. When a friend suggested a different movie, the author stood by their choice. The friend then backed out and stopped participating. \n\nThe key points here are the author's right to choose their own birthday activity and the friend's reaction. The author was clear it was optional, so friends could opt out. The friend might have felt their suggestion wasn't considered, but the author had the right to prioritize their own preference. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they were transparent and the friends chose to leave. The friend's reaction might be more about their own expectations than the author's actions. So the answer should be B.\n"
