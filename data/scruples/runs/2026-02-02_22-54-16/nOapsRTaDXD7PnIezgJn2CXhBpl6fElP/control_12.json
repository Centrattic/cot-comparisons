I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and someone else not showing up because they wanted a different movie.\n\nFirst, the author planned their own birthday party by choosing the movie and invited friends via group chat, making it optional. Most agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author explained it was their birthday and they wanted that movie, offering to watch another time. The person then left and stopped participating.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author's birthday event, optional attendance, clear communication of their choice, and the friend's reaction. The question is whether the author is wrong for not changing the movie.\n\nI think the author isn't wrong. It's their birthday, and they have the right to choose how to celebrate. They made it clear it was optional, so those who didn't want to go could opt out. The friend had the choice but chose not to come. The author didn't force anyone to attend, so they're not in the wrong.\n"
