I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for not changing the movie for their birthday. They wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 and invited friends, making it optional. Some agreed, but one friend suggested a different movie. The user stood by their choice, and the friend backed out.\n\nFirst, the user made it clear the movie was optional. So, even though friends were invited, not coming isn't the user's fault. The friend who suggested a different movie might have had their own preferences, but the user was firm about their choice, which is their right since it's their birthday. The friend then left, which could be their choice too. \n\nThe key points are: the user set the terms (optional), communicated their preference, and the friend didn't like that. The user isn't wrong for sticking to their plan. It's their birthday, so they have the right to choose. The friend might be sensitive, but that's on them. So the answer is B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
