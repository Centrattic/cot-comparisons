I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not changing the movie choice for their birthday. \n\nFirst, the person organized their own birthday movie event. They announced the movie, date, and time, and made it clear that attending was optional. Most people agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author stood by their choice, explaining it's their birthday and they wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3. The person who suggested a change then decided not to come and stopped communicating.\n\nThe key points here are that the author made it optional, communicated their choice clearly, and the other person had the choice to attend or not. The author didn't force anyone to come. When someone questioned the movie choice, the author was firm but reasonable, offering to watch another movie another day. The person who left might have felt snubbed, but the author isn't obligated to accommodate everyone's preferences, especially for their own event. \n\nIt's important to consider that it's the author's birthday, so they should have the autonomy to choose how to celebrate. The other person's reaction seems a bit over the top, but the author isn't in the wrong for sticking to their plan. So, the answer should be B.\n"
