I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post was in the wrong for not changing the movie choice for their birthday. \n\nFirst, the situation: The person wanted to celebrate their 20th birthday by watching \"How to Train Your Dragon 3\" and invited friends. They made it clear it was optional. Most agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author refused, and that person then backed out and stopped talking in the group chat.\n\nThe key points here are about personal choice and boundaries. The author clearly stated it was their birthday and they wanted to see that movie. They also emphasized it was optional for others to join. The friend didn't show up and stopped participating. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they made their preferences known and the friend chose not to come. The author isn't obligated to change their plan just because someone else doesn't like the choice. The friend's reaction seems over-the-top. However, maybe the author could have been more considerate by offering an alternative time for others who wanted a different movie. But they did say they could watch another movie another day. \n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They had the right to choose their own celebration, and the friend's response was unreasonable.\n"
