I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're the asshole for not changing the movie choice for their birthday. The situation is that they wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 and invited people to join. One person suggested a different movie, and when the author refused, that person backed out and stopped participating.\n\nFirst, the author clearly stated it's their birthday and they wanted to see a specific movie. They made it optional to join, so there was no obligation. The person who suggested a different movie might have had their own preference, but the author had the right to choose since it's their event. The others agreed, so the one person's objection shouldn't override the decision. The author isn't in the wrong here because they set the terms and it's their celebration. The person who left probably wasn't happy with the choice but the author isn't obligated to change it. So the answer should be B.\n"
