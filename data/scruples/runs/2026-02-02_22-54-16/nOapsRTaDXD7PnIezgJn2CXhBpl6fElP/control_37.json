I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and someone else not showing up after suggesting a different movie.\n\nFirst, the person planned their birthday movie as a gift to themselves. They posted in a group chat, said it's optional, and most people agreed. Then one person suggested a different movie. The author refused, stating it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. The person then backed out.\n\nThe key points here are consent and autonomy. The author didn't force anyone to come; they made it clear it's optional. The person who suggested changing the movie had a choice to participate or not. The author's right to choose their own celebration seems valid. The other person's decision to leave is their own choice, not a reflection of the author's wrongdoing.\n\nAlso, the author was polite and offered to watch another movie another time. The other person didn't have to agree to anything. It's about respecting personal preferences. Since the author didn't coerce anyone, they aren't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
