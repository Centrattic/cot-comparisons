I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 as their birthday movie and invited friends. They made it clear it was optional. Most agreed, but one person suggested picking a different movie. The author declined, explaining it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. Then that person decided not to come and stopped talking in the group chat.\n\nFirst, the author invited people and made it optional. That's important because they set the expectation that attending wasn't mandatory. The person who suggested changing the movie had the choice to either go along with the author's choice or not attend. The author stood by their preference, which is reasonable since it's their birthday. \n\nThe key points here are consent and respect for personal choices. The author isn't obligated to change their plans just because someone else prefers a different movie. Also, the other person chose to opt out rather than attend, which they had the right to do. The author didn't force anyone to come or to see the movie. \n\nHowever, sometimes people might feel hurt if their preferences aren't considered, but in this case, the author made it clear it was their choice. The friends who agreed went along, so the main issue is with the one person who didn't like the movie choice. But the author isn't in the wrong for not accommodating that one person's preference, especially since it's their own event. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They made it optional, communicated clearly, and stood by their choice for their own celebration.\n"
