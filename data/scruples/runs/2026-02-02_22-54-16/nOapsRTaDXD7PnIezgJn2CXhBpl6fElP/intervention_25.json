I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and some friends wanting to change it. The author posted the movie choice and time, said it's optional, most agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author refused, and that person left the group chat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author made it clear it's their birthday and they chose the movie. They mentioned it's optional, so people could opt out. The person who objected didn't come, but the author is questioning if they should have changed the movie.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I should check if there's any indication the author was unreasonable. The movie was chosen for their birthday, they communicated it's optional, and the person who left didn't have to go. The author didn't force anyone to attend. The person who left might be overreacting, expecting the author to change their choice. The author's response was polite, offering another day for another movie. \n\nNo signs of the author being inconsiderate. They respected others' choices by making it optional. The person who left didn't respect the author's birthday choice by pushing for a different movie. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
