I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and some friends wanting to change it.\n\nFirst, the author planned their own birthday movie outing and shared the info in a group chat, making it optional. Most friends agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author stood their ground, saying it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. The friend then backed out and stopped talking in the group.\n\nThe key points here: The author made it clear it's their birthday and they chose the movie, and everyone was invited optionally. The friend had a request but the author didn't have to accommodate it. The author was firm but polite, offering another time for a different movie. The friend's reaction was to leave, which might be their own issue.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they organized their own event and have the right to choose. The friend might have felt ignored, but the author wasn't obligated to change the plan. Answer B seems right.\n"
