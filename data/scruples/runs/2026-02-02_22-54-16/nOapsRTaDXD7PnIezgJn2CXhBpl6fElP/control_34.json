I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they did something wrong by not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. They wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 and invited friends. When one person suggested a different movie, the user stood their ground, explaining it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. The friend then backed out and stopped chatting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user made it clear the movie was optional, and most people agreed. The one person who objected didn't come. The user's reasoning is that it's their birthday, so they have the right to choose. Friends should understand that. The key points here are consent and personal choice. The user wasn't forcing anyone to come; they invited others but emphasized it's optional. The person who objected is free to decline. \n\nFriendships involve respecting each other's preferences. The user didn't act out of malice. They were clear about their choice and even offered to see another movie another time. The friend's reaction seems a bit harsh, but maybe they had a strong preference. However, the user isn't in the wrong here because they made their choice clear and it's their birthday. They didn't coerce anyone. So, the answer is B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
