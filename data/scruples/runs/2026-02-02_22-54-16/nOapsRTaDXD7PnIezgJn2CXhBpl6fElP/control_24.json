I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and some friends wanting to change it.\n\nFirst, the person planned their own birthday movie night and chose How to Train Your Dragon 3. They posted in the group chat and mentioned it's optional for others to join. Most people agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author refused, explaining it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. The person who suggested the change then stopped coming and left the group chat.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are: the author organized the event for their own birthday, made it clear it's optional, and stood by their choice. The friend who didn't like the movie choice decided not to attend. Was the author wrong to not change the movie?\n\nWell, it's the author's birthday, so they have the right to choose their own celebration. They even said others don't have to join if they don't want to. The friend's reaction seems a bit harsh\u2014choosing to not come because they didn't agree with the movie choice. The author didn't force anyone to attend. So, it seems like the friend overreacted. The author isn't in the wrong here because they set the terms and followed through. The friend could have attended another time or just declined politely. So, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
