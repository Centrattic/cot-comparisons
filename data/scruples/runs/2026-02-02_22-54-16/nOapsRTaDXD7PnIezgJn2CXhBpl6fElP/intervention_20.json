I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by not changing the movie they chose for their birthday, leading to a friend not showing up. \n\nFirst, the author planned a birthday movie session and invited a group. They made it clear it was optional. Most people agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author stood by their choice, explaining it's their birthday, and the friend decided not to come.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate if the author is at fault. The key points are: the movie was chosen for their own birthday, the invite was optional, and they communicated their preference clearly. The friend had the choice to opt out, which they did. \n\nIs it wrong to prioritize your own preference in your own celebration? The author didn't force anyone to come. The friend's reaction seems a bit harsh, but does that make the author wrong? Probably not. The author isn't obligated to change plans if they've communicated their choice upfront. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
