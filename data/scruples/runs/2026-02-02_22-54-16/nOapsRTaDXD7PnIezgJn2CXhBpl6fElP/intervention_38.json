I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and some group members not showing up after suggesting a different movie.\n\nFirst, the author planned their own birthday movie, chose How to Train Your Dragon 3, posted it in the group chat, and said it's optional. Most people agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author stood by their choice, explaining it's their birthday. Then the person who suggested the change backed out and stopped communicating. The author is wondering if they should have changed the movie.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author made it clear the movie was optional and that they wanted to see that specific one. They invited others but didn't make it mandatory. The person who didn't come was the one who suggested changing the movie, but the author didn't budge. The others who agreed showed up, and the one who didn't just left.\n\nFrom my perspective, the author isn't wrong. They had the right to choose their own birthday activity, especially since they were clear about it being optional. The other person chose not to come after being told the author's preference. The author didn't force anyone to come, so they're not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
