I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and not changing it despite a friend suggesting a different one. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The person wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their 20th birthday. They posted in a group chat, said it's optional for others to join, and most agreed. Then one person suggested picking a different movie. The author refused, explaining it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. The friend then decided not to come and stopped talking in the group chat.\n\nNow, considering social norms and expectations. When someone invites others to an event they're hosting, especially for their own celebration, there's usually an expectation that they can choose the details, unless there's a prior agreement otherwise. The author made it clear that the movie choice was theirs and that others could join or not. The friend's suggestion to change the movie might have been a personal preference, but the author had the right to stick with their choice since it's their birthday.\n\nThe friend's reaction of not showing up and leaving the group chat seems a bit harsh. If they didn't want to attend, they could have said so without making a scene. The author wasn't obligated to change the movie, especially since they had already communicated it was optional. The key point here is that the author's choice was their own, and the friend's response was their own decision, not necessarily the author's fault.\n\nAlso, the author included a note that they like the movie because it's a good one, which reinforces that their choice wasn't arbitrary. The friend might have felt ignored, but since the author made it clear it was their choice, the friend's responsibility was to attend or not. The group chat was optional, so those who didn't like the choice had the option to not participate, which they did.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on whether the person did something wrong. Here, the author followed through on their plan as they stated, honored the friend's choice not to come, and didn't force others to attend. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
