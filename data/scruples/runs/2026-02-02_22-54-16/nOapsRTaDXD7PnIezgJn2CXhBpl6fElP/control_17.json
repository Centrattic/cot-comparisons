I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. \n\nFirst, the situation: The person wanted to see \"How to Train Your Dragon 3\" for their 20th birthday and invited friends via a group chat, saying it's optional. Most agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author refused, stating it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. The person who suggested the change then backed out and stopped participating.\n\nNow, considering the key points. The author made it clear it's optional for others to join. They communicated the movie choice in advance and allowed others to opt out. When someone wanted a different movie, the author stood by their choice, which is understandable since it's their birthday. The friend who didn't like the choice decided not to come, which is their right. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. They made it clear it's their choice, and friends can choose to participate or not. The author didn't force others to attend or agree. The friend's issue was about the movie choice, but since the author was clear it's their birthday, they're within their rights to pick the movie. The friend's response of backing out is a personal choice, but the author isn't wrong for not changing the plan.\n"
