I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about them choosing a movie for their birthday and some friends wanting to change it, but the author refused and the friends left.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author planned to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their 20th birthday. They posted in a group chat, said it's optional for others to join. Most agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author stood by their choice, and the person left the group chat. Now the author is wondering if they were wrong.\n\nThe main question is whether the author was in the wrong by not changing the movie. Let's think about the factors. The author clearly stated it was their birthday and they chose the movie. They also mentioned it's optional for others to come. The friends agreed to come, but one person later objected. The author's response was firm but polite, offering to see another movie another day. The person who objected then left the conversation.\n\nSo the author had the right to choose their own birthday plans. The friends were invited but weren't required to attend. The person who objected might have felt their preference wasn't respected, but the author was within their rights to make a personal choice. The fact that the friends initially agreed and then one objector left might show that the author isn't at fault. The key here is the author's autonomy in their own celebration. Unless there was a prior agreement to pick a movie together, the author's choice stands. The answer is probably B (Not in the wrong).\n"
