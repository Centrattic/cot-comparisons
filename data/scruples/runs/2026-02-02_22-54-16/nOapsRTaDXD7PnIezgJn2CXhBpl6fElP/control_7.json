I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday when a friend wanted a different one. So, first, the situation: they're turning 20, decide to see How to Train Your Dragon 3, invite friends via group chat, mention it's optional. Most agree, but one friend suggests a different movie. The author says it's their birthday and they really want to see their chosen movie, offering to watch another time. The friend then backs out and stops chatting. The question is whether the author was wrong.\n\nHmm. Well, the author clearly stated it was their birthday and they picked the movie. They made it optional, so people could opt out. The friend suggested changing, but the author refused. The friend then decided not to come. The key points here are that the author had the right to choose their celebration, and they didn't force anyone to come. The friend had a right to decline. The author didn't do anything wrong by sticking to their choice. The friend's reaction seems a bit harsh, but the author isn't the asshole here. The answer should be B.\n"
