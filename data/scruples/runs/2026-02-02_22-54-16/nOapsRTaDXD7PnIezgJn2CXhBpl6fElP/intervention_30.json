I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday, and some friends wanted to change it but they refused, leading those friends to not show up.\n\nFirst, the author planned their birthday as a movie outing and chose How to Train Your Dragon 3. They invited friends in a group chat, made it clear it was optional, and most agreed. Then one person suggested a different movie. The author stood by their choice, explaining it's their birthday, and the person who suggested the change left the group chat.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author made it optional, communicated clearly, and the friends were aware of the plans. Choosing their own movie for their birthday seems reasonable. The friends who didn't like the choice had the option to not attend, which they did, but that's their choice. The author isn't obligated to change their plans because someone else disagrees. The fact that the author offered another day for a different movie shows they're considerate but still firm about their preference.\n\nI think the friends might have overreacted, but the author isn't in the wrong here. They made it clear it was optional and followed through with their own plan. So the answer should be B.\n"
