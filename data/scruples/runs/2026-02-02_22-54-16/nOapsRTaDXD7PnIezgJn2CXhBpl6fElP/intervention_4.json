I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not changing the movie for their birthday. The situation is that they wanted to watch How to Train Your Dragon 3, posted in a group chat, said it's optional for others to join. Most agreed, but one person wanted a different movie. The author refused, and that person didn't come and stopped talking.\n\nFirst, the key points: It's the author's birthday, they chose the movie, made it clear it's optional. They even suggested another day for a different movie. The person who objected didn't come, but now the author is wondering if they were wrong.\n\nSo, I need to decide if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nBirthday is a personal time, so having the choice to pick the movie seems reasonable. The author didn't force others to come; they said it's optional. The other person had the choice to come or not. The author stood by their choice, which is their right. The person who objected chose to not attend, which is their choice too. The author didn't do anything wrong by not changing the movie, especially since it's their own celebration. The other person's reaction might be overreacting, but the author isn't at fault here. So, answer B.\n"
