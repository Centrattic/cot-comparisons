I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday. They posted in a group chat about seeing How to Train Your Dragon 3, said it's optional for others to join, and most agreed. Then one person suggested a different movie, the author refused, and that person left the group chat.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author made it clear it's their birthday and they chose the movie. They emphasized it's optional, so people could opt out. The person who suggested a different movie later backed out. The author is now unsure if they should have changed the movie.\n\nFrom an etiquette standpoint, when it's your own event or celebration, you have the right to choose the plans, especially if you've communicated it's optional. The person who suggested changing the movie might be inconsiderate if they expected the author to change their preference. However, the other person's reaction of not coming and ghosting could be harsh, but that's their choice. The author isn't obligated to cater to others' preferences if they've already set the terms. The fact that most agreed to come suggests the majority was okay with the choice. The author's response was reasonable: they stood by their choice but offered to see another movie another time. The other person's actions don't necessarily make the author wrong; they just had a different reaction. So, probably the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
