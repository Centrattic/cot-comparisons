I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the person wanted to celebrate their 20th birthday by watching How to Train Your Dragon 3. They posted in a group chat, saying it's optional for others to join. Most people agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author stood by their choice, explaining it's their birthday and they really wanted that movie. The person who suggested the change then backed out and stopped participating in the group chat.\n\nHmm, the key points here are that the author made it clear the movie was optional, and they were open to other times. The friend wanted a different movie, but the author didn't have to oblige since it's their celebration. The friend chose not to come after the movie wasn't changed. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, they were upfront, it's their special day, and they have the right to choose. The friend might have felt their preference wasn't considered, but the author wasn't forcing anyone to come. The friend's reaction seems a bit harsh, maybe overreacting. The author didn't do anything wrong by sticking to their choice. Plus, others did agree to come, so the majority was okay with it. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. They made it optional, communicated clearly, and the friend's decision to leave is on them.\n"
