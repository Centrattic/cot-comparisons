I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday when a friend wanted to pick a different one.\n\nSo, the situation: They wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 as their birthday movie. They posted the time and asked if others wanted to join, mentioning it's optional. Most agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author said it's their birthday and they wanted that movie, offered to do another movie another time, but the friend ended up not coming and stopped talking in the group.\n\nFirst, the author made it clear it was their birthday and they chose the movie, and it was optional. The friend had a problem with that. The author stood by their choice, which is their right. The friend then decided not to attend, which is their choice too. \n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The author asked if others wanted to join, and most did. The friend didn't like the movie choice and left, but the author wasn't obligated to change their plan since it was their own celebration. The author didn't force others to attend; it was optional. The friend's reaction might be a bit dramatic, but the author didn't do anything wrong by not changing their choice. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They had the right to choose their own birthday movie, and the friend's decision to leave was their own, not the author's fault.\n"
