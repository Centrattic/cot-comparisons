I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their own birthday and getting pushback from a group chat member.\n\nFirst, the author planned to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 as their birthday movie. They posted in the group chat, made it clear it's optional, and most people agreed. Then one person suggested changing the movie. The author stood by their choice, explaining it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. The person then backed out and stopped talking in the group.\n\nSo, the main points here: the author is celebrating their own birthday, made the movie choice clear as optional, and the dissenting person had the option to not attend. The author didn't force anyone to come. They even said they could watch another movie another day. The person who objected didn't attend, but the author is now wondering if they should have changed the movie.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, when it's your birthday, you have the right to choose how you want to celebrate. The group was invited optionally, so if one person didn't like the movie choice, they weren't obligated to come. The author didn't act unkindly; they explained their reasoning and left the door open for other times. The person who left might have had their own issues, maybe they didn't like the movie or felt the author wasn't considering others, but the author's actions don't seem inconsiderate. They made it clear it was their choice for their special day. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
