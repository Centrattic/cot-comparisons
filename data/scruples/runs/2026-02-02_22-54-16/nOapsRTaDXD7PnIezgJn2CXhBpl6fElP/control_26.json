I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me think through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the person wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their birthday and invited friends via group chat, making it optional. Most friends agreed, but one suggested a different movie. The author stood their ground, saying it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. Then the person who suggested the change stopped coming and left the group chat.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the initial invitation being optional, the fact that most people agreed, and the one person not getting their way. The author didn't force anyone to come; they just invited. When someone asked to change the movie, the author politely declined, which is their right since it's their birthday. The other person then decided not to attend, which is their choice too. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they didn't make it mandatory for anyone to attend. They communicated it was optional. When someone wanted a different movie, the author explained it's their choice for the birthday. That seems reasonable. The person who left might be overreacting, expecting their preference to be prioritized over the birthday person's choice. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
