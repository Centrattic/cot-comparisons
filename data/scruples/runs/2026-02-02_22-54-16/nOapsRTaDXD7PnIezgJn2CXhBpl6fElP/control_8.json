I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the person choosing a movie for their birthday and not changing it despite a friend's suggestion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The person wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their 20th birthday and invited friends via a group chat, saying it's optional. Most agreed, but one person wanted a different movie. The author refused, and the friend backed out.\n\nNow, considering the key points: the author clearly stated it was their birthday and they chose the movie. They offered to see another movie another day. The friend then didn't come. The author is now questioning if they should have compromised.\n\nThe question is whether the author is the asshole (AITA). The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom the details, the author didn't force anyone to come. They made it optional. Choosing a movie for a personal celebration seems reasonable. The friend's reaction seems a bit harsh because the author respected their input but stuck to their choice. The friend's decision not to attend after being told the movie wasn't changing might be their own choice, not the author's fault.\n\nAlso, the author asked for company but didn't make it mandatory. So, the friend's withdrawal is their own choice. The author isn't obligated to change their plans for others unless agreed upon. The fact that most others agreed and the author was clear about the movie choice suggests they're not in the wrong.\n"
