I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story did something wrong by not changing the movie for their birthday. The situation is that they wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3, invited friends, and when one person suggested a different movie, the author refused, leading the friend to not come and stop participating in the group chat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author made it clear that the movie was optional, which is good. They asked if people wanted to join and said it's their birthday choice. When someone objected, the author stood by their decision, which is their right. The friend was free to decline the invitation if they didn't want to watch that movie. The author didn't force anyone to come. \n\nThe main question is whether the author was wrong by not changing the movie. The friend's reaction seems a bit harsh. Choosing a movie for a personal event is a personal choice, especially when it's the person's birthday. The author was clear from the start, so the friend might have agreed to something else but later changed their mind, which isn't fair. The author isn't responsible for the friend's decision to leave. \n\nAlso, the author offered the possibility of another movie another day, which shows they were considering others' preferences. So, the author's actions seem reasonable. They didn't do anything wrong by not changing their choice. The friend might have misread the situation or expected the author to prioritize their preference. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
