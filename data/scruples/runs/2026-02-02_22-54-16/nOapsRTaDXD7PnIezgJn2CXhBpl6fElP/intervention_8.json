I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday.\n\nThe author planned to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 as their birthday movie and posted in a group chat to invite others. They made it optional. Most people agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author refused, stating it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. The person who suggested it then backed out and stopped participating.\n\nI need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are that the author made it optional, the person who suggested another movie didn't join anyway, and the author wasn't forcing others to come. The person who left probably didn't like being told no, but the author had the right to choose their own birthday activity. Since the author invited others but didn't pressure them, their actions seem reasonable. The other person's reaction might be overreacting. So the answer is B.\n"
