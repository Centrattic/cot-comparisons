I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who didn't change the movie for their birthday is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nSo, the person wanted to celebrate their 20th birthday by watching How to Train Your Dragon 3. They posted in a group chat that it's optional for others to join. Most people agreed, but one person suggested changing the movie. The author refused, stating it's their birthday and they wanted to see that movie. The person who suggested the change then decided not to come and stopped talking in the group chat.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about personal choice and expectations. The author made it clear that it's optional for others to join, so they can't be blamed for people not showing up. When someone wanted a different movie, the author stood by their choice, which is their right since it's their birthday. The other person left because they didn't agree, but that's their choice too. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they invited people on their terms. People have different preferences, and the author made it clear it's their decision. The other person didn't have to come if they didn't like the movie choice. The author also offered to watch another movie on another day, showing consideration. So, they're not being inconsiderate, just firm in their choice. \n\nBut wait, maybe some might argue that being flexible could have been better. However, since the author was clear it's optional and they tried to accommodate by suggesting another day, it seems reasonable. The other person's reaction is their own choice, not the author's fault. \n\nSo, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
