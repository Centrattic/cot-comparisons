I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for not changing the movie they chose for their 20th birthday. They wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 and invited friends, saying it's optional. Most agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author refused, stating it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. The person then backed out and stopped chatting.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong. The key points here are about personal choice versus others' expectations. The author made it clear it's their birthday and the movie was their choice. They also said others could come if they wanted, which they did. The person who suggested changing the movie didn't show up anyway. The author didn't force anyone to come, just made their preferences known. It seems like they're within their rights to choose how they spend their birthday. The fact that one person didn't come because they disagreed doesn't make the author wrong. People have different preferences, and it's their special day. I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
