I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't change the movie for their birthday is in the wrong. The situation is that they wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their 20th birthday and invited friends. Initially, most agreed, but then one person suggested a different movie. The author refused, saying it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. The person then backed out and stopped talking. Now the author is unsure if they should have changed it.\n\nFirst, the author made it clear the movie was optional. They invited people but didn't pressure anyone. When someone objected, the author stood by their choice, which is their right since it's their birthday. The friend who left could have chosen not to go but instead decided to withdraw from the group, which might be their issue. The author didn't force anyone to attend; they just wanted to see the movie they chose. The friend's reaction seems harsh, especially since the author was upfront about it being their choice. So, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong. They had the right to pick their movie for their own birthday celebration.\n"
