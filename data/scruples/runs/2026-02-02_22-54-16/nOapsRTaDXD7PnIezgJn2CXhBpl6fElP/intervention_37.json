I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who posted the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and someone else getting upset when they wanted a different one.\n\nFirst, the user says it was their 20th birthday, and they wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3. They posted in a group chat that it was optional for others to join. Most people agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author stood by their choice, explaining it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. The person then backed out and stopped talking in the group chat. The author is now wondering if they should have changed the movie.\n\nSo, the key points here are: The author made it clear it was optional for others to join, and they had chosen the movie for their own birthday. When someone wanted a different movie, the author stuck to their choice. The person who suggested a different movie then decided not to come. \n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The person who wants a different movie might feel their preference isn't respected, but since the author was clear it's their birthday and others had agreed, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The other person could have chosen not to attend if the movie wasn't to their taste, since it was optional. The author didn't force anyone to come. \n\nBut maybe there's a social expectation that when inviting others, you consider their preferences? However, the user did say it was optional. If someone wants to join, they should accept the terms, which include the chosen movie. The person who suggested another movie might have been trying to get the group to agree on a different choice, but the author had the right to stick with their preference, especially on their own occasion. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the author could have been more flexible, but since they had already made it optional and most people agreed, the author isn't obligated to change their plans. The person who left could have just not attended instead of trying to change the movie. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They made it clear it's optional, they had their own preference, and the person who left chose not to attend. The answer would be B (No).\n"
