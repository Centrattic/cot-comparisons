I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not changing the movie selection for their birthday. \n\nSo, the situation: The person wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their birthday. They posted in a group chat, made it clear it's optional to join, most people agreed. Then one person suggested a different movie, the author declined, explaining it's their birthday choice. The person then decided not to come and stopped participating in the group chat.\n\nFirst, the key points here. The author made it optional for others to join. They communicated clearly that they wanted to see the specific movie. The person who suggested a different movie then withdrew. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The person set up the event as their own birthday choice. They weren't forcing others to attend, just inviting. The other person's issue was with the movie choice, not the event itself. The author stood by their choice, which is their right, especially since it's their birthday. \n\nPossible angles: Did the author have to accommodate someone's preference over their own? Probably not, since it's their event. The other person chose not to attend, which is their right as well. The author didn't pressure anyone to come. \n\nBut maybe there's a nuance. Maybe the group had an expectation of picking a movie together, but the author didn't state that. However, they did make it clear it's optional. The person who suggested a different movie might have felt their preference wasn't heard, but the author explained their reasoning. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, usually, if someone sets the terms and others don't like it, the person setting the terms isn't in the wrong unless they acted inconsiderately. Here, the author was considerate by making it optional and explaining their choice. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
