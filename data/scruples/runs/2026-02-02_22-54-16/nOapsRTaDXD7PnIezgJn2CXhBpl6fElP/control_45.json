I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday party. The situation is that they picked How to Train Your Dragon 3, invited people via group chat, and when someone suggested a different movie, they refused and the person left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user specifically mentioned it's their birthday and that they wanted to see that movie. They also made it clear that attending was optional. When someone objected, they stood by their choice, which is reasonable since it's their event. The other person chose not to attend after the decision was made. \n\nThe key points are: the user set the terms, the movie was their choice for their birthday, and they didn't force others to come. The person who left might have had a different preference, but the user wasn't obligated to change it. It's their celebration, so they have the right to choose. The others who agreed were respectful, while the one person who left might have been expecting their preference to be prioritized, which isn't the case here. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. They communicated clearly, it's their event, and they made it optional. The other person's reaction is a bit harsh, but the user's stance is justified.\n"
