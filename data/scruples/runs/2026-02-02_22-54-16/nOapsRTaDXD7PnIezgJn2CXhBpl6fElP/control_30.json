I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their 20th birthday and invited friends via a group chat, making it optional. Most agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author stood their ground, saying it's their birthday and they wanted to see that movie. The person then backed out and stopped participating. Now the user is wondering if they should have changed the movie.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the initial invitation, which was optional. The user didn't force anyone to come; they just asked if people wanted to join. The friend suggested a different movie, but the user declined, which is their right since it's their birthday. The friend then chose not to attend, which is also their choice. \n\nWait, but maybe the user didn't consider that even though it's optional, suggesting they're not changing the movie might make some friends feel their preferences don't matter. But the user did say it's their birthday, so they have a reason to pick the movie. Also, they offered to see another movie another day. \n\nThe friend's reaction seems a bit over the top. If someone suggests a different movie and then backs out when it's not accepted, that's their decision, but it's not necessarily the user's fault. The user made it clear it's their choice, and the friend didn't have to come. So the user isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
