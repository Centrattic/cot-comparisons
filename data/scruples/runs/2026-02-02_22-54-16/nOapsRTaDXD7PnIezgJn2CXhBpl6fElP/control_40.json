I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and others getting upset when they didn't change it.\n\nFirst, the person planned their own birthday celebration by choosing a movie they wanted to see. They posted in a group chat, made it clear it's optional, and most people agreed. But one person suggested a different movie, and the author refused, explaining it's their birthday. Then that person decided not to come.\n\nI need to determine if the author did something wrong. Well, they made it optional, so people could opt out. The one person who suggested a different movie didn't agree with the choice and left, but the author had the right to choose their own celebration. It's their birthday, so they should get to pick. The author didn't force anyone to come; they invited others but didn't make it mandatory. The person who left chose not to attend because they didn't want to see that movie. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
