I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is about their 20th birthday. They wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 and invited friends via group chat, saying it's optional. Most agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author stood their ground, saying it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. The other person then backed out and stopped participating in the group chat.\n\nFirst, the user asked if they're the asshole (AITA). The author's perspective is that they were clear it's optional and they chose the movie because it's their birthday. The friend who wanted a different movie didn't come, but the author is now doubting if they should have changed it.\n\nSo, considering the key points: They made the movie choice clear as part of their birthday plans, emphasized it's optional, and the friend didn't like the choice. The author didn't force anyone to come, just invited. The friend's reaction seems like they were disappointed or maybe wanted to have some say, but the author is within their rights to choose their own celebration. The friend's decision to not attend is their own choice, and the author isn't obligated to change their plans unless they agreed to compromise, which they didn't. The author's response was reasonable\u2014stating it's their birthday and they want that movie. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
