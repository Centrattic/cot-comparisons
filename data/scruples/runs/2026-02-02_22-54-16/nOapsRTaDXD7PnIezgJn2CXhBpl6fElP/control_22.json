I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday. They wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 and invited friends who could come if they wanted. The friends mostly agreed, but one person objected and wanted a different movie. The author stood their ground, saying it's their birthday, and the person backed out.\n\nHmm, first, the author clearly stated it was their birthday and they had chosen the movie. They made it optional for others to join. The person who wanted a different movie might have felt their preference wasn't considered, but the author had the right to choose their own celebration. It's their birthday, so their preferences should take priority. However, maybe the person who left felt excluded or that their opinion wasn't respected. But the author didn't force anyone to come; they just declined to change the movie. \n\nThe key points here are that the author was upfront about their choice and made it clear it's optional. The friend's reaction seems a bit harsh. Maybe they expected compromise, but when the author didn't budge, they left. But since it's the author's birthday, they aren't obligated to change plans. The friend's choice to not attend is on them, not necessarily the author's fault. The author isn't in the wrong because they were clear and made it optional. The friend didn't have to attend if they didn't like the movie choice. So I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
