I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about them choosing a movie for their birthday and not changing it despite someone's objection.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author planned their own birthday movie, invited friends, made it clear it's optional. When one person suggested changing the movie, the author stood by their choice. That person then backed out. The author is wondering if they should have compromised.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about personal choice versus social dynamics. The author made their own decision for their birthday. They didn't force others to come; they just invited them. The friend didn't have a problem with the movie initially but then suggested changing it. The author politely declined and clarified it's their birthday, so they have the final say. The friend then chose not to attend, which is their right.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here because they made it optional. They didn't pressure anyone. The friend's reaction might be over-sensitive. The author had the right to choose their own celebration. However, sometimes in group settings, people might expect some compromise, but since it's the author's birthday, their preference should take priority. The friend not showing up is their choice, but the author isn't wrong for sticking to their plan. So, answer B makes sense.\n"
