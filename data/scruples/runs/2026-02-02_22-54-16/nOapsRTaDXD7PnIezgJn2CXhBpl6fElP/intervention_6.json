I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation. The user is asking if they're the asshole for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. They wanted to watch How to Train Your Dragon 3, posted in a group chat, said it's optional, most people agreed. Then one person suggested a different movie. The user stood their ground, and that person backed out.\n\nHmm, first, the user made it clear it's their birthday and they chose the movie. They emphasized it's optional, so people weren't obligated to come. When someone asked to change the movie, the user politely declined, which is reasonable since it's their event. The person who suggested changing the movie then decided not to come. \n\nThe key points here are that the user communicated their preference clearly and gave others the choice to join or not. They weren't forcing anyone. The other person didn't like the choice and chose to leave, which is their right. The user isn't wrong for sticking to their preference. Maybe the person who left was a bit sensitive, but the user wasn't at fault. They even offered to see another movie another day, which shows consideration. So I think the answer is B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
