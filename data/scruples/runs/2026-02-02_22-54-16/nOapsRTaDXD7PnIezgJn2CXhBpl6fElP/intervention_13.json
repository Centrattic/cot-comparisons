I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about them choosing a movie for their birthday and some people getting upset when they didn't change it.\n\nFirst, the author planned their own birthday movie outing. They posted in a group chat and invited friends, saying it's optional. Most said yes, but one person suggested a different movie. The author stood by their choice, explaining it's their birthday and that they wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3. The person then backed out and stopped participating in the chat.\n\nThe key points here are that the author clearly stated it was their birthday, made the choice, and emphasized it was optional. They offered to do another movie another day. The friend who objected didn't have to go, since it was optional. So the author's actions seem reasonable. They weren't forcing others to come; they just wanted to celebrate their own birthday with a movie they wanted to see. The friend's reaction of dropping out might be their own issue, maybe they felt their preference wasn't respected, but since it was optional, they weren't obligated to attend. The author didn't do anything wrong here. So I think the answer is B.\n"
