I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is the asshole for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. The situation is that the person wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 as their birthday movie and invited friends. When one friend suggested a different movie, the person refused, and the friend backed out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The person clearly stated it was their birthday and they wanted to see that specific movie. They made it optional to join, so friends weren't obligated. The friend suggested a different movie, but the person didn't feel it was necessary to change, which led to the friend not coming. \n\nThe key factors here are intent and context. The person had the right to choose their own birthday activity, especially since it was optional. They even offered to go to another movie another day. The friend might have felt ignored, but the person wasn't forcing others to attend. The friend's decision to leave the group chat could be their own choice, not necessarily the person's fault. \n\nThe person isn't in the wrong because they made their plans clear and gave others the option to participate. The friend's reaction might stem from personal preference, but the person didn't do anything to require changing the movie. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
