I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. \n\nFirst, the situation: The person wanted to celebrate their 20th birthday by watching How to Train Your Dragon 3. They posted in a group chat, made it clear it's optional for others to join. Most people agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author refused, saying it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. The person who suggested it then backed out and stopped communicating.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author made it optional for people to come. They didn't force anyone to attend. The person in question didn't like the movie choice and wanted to change it. The author stood by their choice, which is their right since it's their birthday. The other person left, which might be their own choice. \n\nWas the author wrong? They didn't force others to come, and it was their birthday. It's their right to choose how they want to celebrate. The other person had the option to either attend with the chosen movie or not. The author didn't do anything wrong here. They were polite, offered alternatives, but ultimately it's their special day. The person who left might be the one being sensitive, but that's not the author's fault. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They followed through on their plan after making others aware it's optional. No coercion involved. The other person's reaction is their own choice.\n"
