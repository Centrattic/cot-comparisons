I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're an asshole for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday when a group member suggested a different one. So, first, they wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3, posted the time and date, and said it's optional for others to join. Most people agreed, but one person wanted a different movie. The author stood their ground, saying it's their birthday and they wanted to see that movie, and the person left the conversation.\n\nHmm. The key points here are that the author made it clear the movie was optional, and others agreed. The person who objected didn't come, so the author didn't force them to attend. The main issue is whether the author was wrong for not changing the movie. Since it's the author's birthday, they have the right to choose how to spend it. The others were okay with the choice, and the one person didn't like it but could have just declined. The author wasn't being unreasonable by not changing their preference, especially since they had already set the time and others committed. The person who objected might be overreacting. So, the answer would be No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
