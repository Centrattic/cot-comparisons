I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday. They wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 and invited friends via group chat, saying it's optional. Most agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author refused and said it's their birthday, then the person backed out.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about personal choice and others' reactions. The author made it clear it's optional and their choice for the event. They didn't force anyone to come. When someone objected, the author stood by their decision, which is reasonable. The person who left was probably expecting the author to compromise, but the author was firm. \n\nIs it fair to say the author is wrong? Probably not. They had the right to choose how they wanted to celebrate their birthday. The other person might have felt ignored, but the author didn't make it mandatory. Maybe the issue is that the suggestion came after others agreed, but the author still had the final say. \n\nAlso, the author offered an alternative (another movie on another day), which shows consideration. The person who left might have been uncool about it, expecting the author to change plans. So, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
