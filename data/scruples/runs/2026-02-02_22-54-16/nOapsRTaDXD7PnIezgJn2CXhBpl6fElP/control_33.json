I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday movie outing.\n\nFirst, the key points: The person wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their 20th birthday. They posted in a group chat, said it's optional. Most people agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author stood by their choice, explaining it's their birthday and they really wanted to see that movie. The person who suggested a different movie then decided not to come and stopped talking in the group chat.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user wants a yes or no answer (A or B). \n\nI need to consider social norms here. When planning a group activity, especially for a personal occasion like a birthday, the host usually has the final say in the plans unless others are uncomfortable or there's a mutual agreement. The author clearly stated it's optional and that they wanted to see that movie. The other person's reaction was to withdraw rather than accept the author's choice. The author didn't force others to come; they made it optional. \n\nAnother angle: Did the author overstep? They didn't make the movie mandatory, so if others wanted to join, they could. The fact that one person didn't come after the movie was chosen doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. The author had the right to choose their own celebration. \n\nPotential counterpoints: Maybe the author should have been more considerate of others' preferences. But since they offered a different day for another movie, they did show consideration. Also, the person who objected had the choice to not attend, which they exercised. \n\nSo, the author isn't at fault. Answer B.\n"
