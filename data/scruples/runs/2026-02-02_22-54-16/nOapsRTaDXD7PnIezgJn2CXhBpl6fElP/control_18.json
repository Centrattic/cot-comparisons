I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not changing the movie for their 20th birthday. They wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 and invited friends. Some agreed, but one person wanted a different movie. The author stood by their choice, and the person who wanted a different movie backed out. Now the author is wondering if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, the author made it clear the movie was optional. They posted in a group chat and said it's up to others to join or not. That seems responsible because they set the expectations. When someone asked to change the movie, the author explained it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. Then the person decided not to come. \n\nThe key points here are about personal choice and respecting boundaries. The author had the right to choose their own celebration, especially since they were clear it's optional. The friend who didn't come might be taking it personally, but if it's optional, the friend isn't entitled to a different movie. The author isn't forcing anyone to attend or agree. \n\nAlso, the author didn't pressure others to come, just invited them. The friend's reaction could be about feeling left out or not considered, but the author can't be blamed for that. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because they followed through with their own preference and made it clear it's optional.\n"
