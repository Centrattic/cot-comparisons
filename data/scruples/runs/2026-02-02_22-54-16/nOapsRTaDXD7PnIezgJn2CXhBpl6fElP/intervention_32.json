I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday.\n\nFirst, they planned to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 as their birthday movie and invited friends. They made it clear it was optional. Most friends agreed, but one person suggested changing the movie. The author stood their ground, explaining it's their birthday and the chosen movie. The person who suggested changing the movie then backed out and stopped talking in the group chat.\n\nThe key points here are: the author made the movie choice clear, emphasized it was optional, and the friend didn't go after being refused. The author's reasoning is that it's their birthday, so they should choose the movie. Friends have the right to decline, but the author didn't force anyone to come. The friend's reaction seems over the top, maybe because they wanted to see a different movie but didn't get their way. However, the author didn't do anything wrong by sticking to their choice. They were clear and considerate by offering an alternative time. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
