I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and some friends wanting to change it.\n\nFirst, the user organized a birthday movie outing and chose How to Train Your Dragon 3. They made it clear it was optional for others to join. Most friends agreed, but one suggested a different movie. The author refused, stating it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. The friend then backed out and stopped communicating.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author had the right to choose their own birthday celebration, especially since they initiated the event. They also emphasized that attendance was optional, so others weren't obligated to come. The friend's request to change the movie might have been a personal preference, but the author wasn't required to comply since it's their own event. The friend's reaction of not attending and disengaging seems a bit harsh, but maybe they felt excluded or upset. However, the author didn't force anyone to attend, so they aren't necessarily in the wrong. The key points are ownership of the event and the optional nature of participation. The friend might need to respect the author's choice, even if they disagree. So, the answer is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
