I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves choosing a movie for their 20th birthday and not changing it despite a friend suggesting a different one.\n\nFirst, the author planned to see \"How to Train Your Dragon 3\" as a gift to themselves. They posted in a group chat, made it clear that attending was optional. Most friends agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author stood by their choice, explaining it's their birthday, and the friend then backed out.\n\nThe key points here are the author's autonomy in choosing their own celebration and the friend's reaction. The author didn't force anyone to attend; they just invited people. The friend had the choice to come or not based on the movie. Since the author had already stated it's optional, they aren't obligated to change their plans to accommodate someone else's preference. The friend's response of stopping communication seems harsh, but the author isn't at fault for sticking to their choice. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning for liking the movie is valid\u2014they mentioned it's a good movie. The friend's suggestion might have been a request, but it's not a demand. The author isn't in the wrong for not giving in, especially since the event was optional. The main issue here is the friend's reaction, not the author's decision.\n"
