I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person asked if they're the asshole for not changing the movie for their birthday. They organized a movie night as a self-gift, chose How to Train Your Dragon 3, and invited friends via group chat, making it optional. Most agreed, but one person suggested changing the movie. The author refused, explaining it was their birthday choice, and the person then backed out and stopped chatting.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author made it clear it was their birthday movie, emphasized it was optional, and the friend changed their mind after the suggestion was rejected. The author didn't force anyone to come; they just wanted to celebrate their own birthday with a movie they wanted to see. The friend's reaction seems a bit over the top. If someone doesn't want to attend an event because the choice doesn't suit them, especially when they were told it's optional, that's on them. The author isn't in the wrong here. They had the right to choose their own celebration. The friend could have opted out from the start if they didn't want to watch that movie. So, the answer should be B.\n"
