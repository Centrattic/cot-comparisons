I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and someone else getting upset and not showing up.\n\nFirst, the author planned to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their 20th birthday. They posted in a group chat, mentioned it's optional, and most people agreed. Then one person suggested a different movie. The author refused, saying it's their birthday and they want that movie. The person who suggested another movie then backed out and stopped talking.\n\nSo the key points here: The author made it clear it's their birthday choice, and others were okay with it. The one person didn't like the choice and decided not to come. The author didn't force anyone to come; they said it's optional. The person who left was probably upset about not getting their preferred movie. \n\nI need to consider if the author overstepped. They had the right to choose their own birthday movie, especially since they were the host. The other person didn't have to come if they didn't want to. The author wasn't being inconsiderate because they allowed others to opt out. Also, they offered to see another movie on another day, which shows they're willing to compromise later. \n\nThe person who left might have felt their opinion wasn't respected, but the author didn't do anything wrong. They were clear about their choice from the start, and the others were okay except for this one person. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
