I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't change the movie for their birthday is in the wrong. The situation is that they wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their 20th birthday and invited friends. Most agreed, but one person wanted a different movie. The author stood by their choice, and the person who wanted a different movie left the group chat.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the author's right to choose their own movie for their birthday. They made it clear it was optional for others to join, so maybe they have a right to their preference. But maybe the person who left felt excluded or that their opinion wasn't considered. However, the author did offer to see another movie on another day, which shows they were open to other times. \n\nIs it wrong to stick to your chosen movie for your own celebration? Since it's their birthday, they might have the right to do so. The person who wanted a different movie might have been inconsiderate by not respecting the birthday wish. But maybe the author could have considered others' preferences more, especially if it's a group activity. However, the author did make it optional, so the others weren't obligated to attend if they didn't like the choice. \n\nThe person left because they couldn't get their way, which might indicate they were being a bit selfish. The author was clear about their intentions from the start, so they aren't necessarily wrong for not changing the movie. The problem here might be more on the person who left, not the author. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because they organized their own birthday activity with optional attendance and stood by their choice, which is reasonable.\n"
