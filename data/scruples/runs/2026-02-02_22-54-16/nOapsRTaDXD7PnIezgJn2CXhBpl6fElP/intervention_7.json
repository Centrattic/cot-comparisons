I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about organizing a movie night for their birthday and not changing the movie when someone suggested another choice.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author chose the movie, mentioned it was optional for others to join, and most agreed. Then one person asked to change the movie, and the author stood by their choice. The person who wanted a different movie decided not to come and stopped talking in the group chat.\n\nI need to determine if the author was wrong. The person had the right to choose the movie for their own birthday celebration. They also made it clear that attendance was optional. The person who didn't come was the one who had an issue with the movie choice and chose not to attend, which is their choice. The author didn't force anyone to come or to like the movie. \n\nThe group chat stopped talking, but the author didn't do anything to cause that. The other person's reaction seems to be the issue here. The author didn't act inconsiderately; they respected their choice by allowing others to opt out. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they made it clear it's their birthday choice and others could opt out without obligation.\n"
