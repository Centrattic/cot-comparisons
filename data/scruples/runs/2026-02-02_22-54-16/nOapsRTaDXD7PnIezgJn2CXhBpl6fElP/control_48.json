I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about them choosing a movie for their birthday and not changing it even when a friend wanted a different one, leading to the friend not showing up.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author planned their birthday movie as How to Train Your Dragon 3 and invited friends. They made it optional, so friends could opt out. Most agreed, but one person suggested changing the movie. The author refused, sticking to their choice because it's their birthday. Then that friend left the group chat and didn't attend.\n\nThe key points here are: the author made the invitation optional, so friends weren't obligated to come. They communicated their choice clearly and stood by it. The friend had a different preference, but the author wasn't required to comply because it's their birthday. The friend's reaction of not attending is their choice, but does that make the author wrong?\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. They made it clear it was optional. They had the right to choose their own celebration. The friend might have felt it's a group activity and wanted to pick a movie everyone likes, but the author's right to decide their own birthday plans is valid. The friend's withdrawal is a personal decision, but the author didn't force anyone to come. So, the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
