I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and some friends not showing up after suggesting a different movie.\n\nSo, the person planned to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their 20th birthday and invited friends. They mentioned it's optional. Most agreed, but one friend suggested changing the movie. The author refused, saying it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. Then the friend backed out and others stopped talking.\n\nHmm, the key points here are: the author asked if others wanted to join, said it's optional, and the friends who stayed probably agreed. The one friend wanted a different movie, but the author didn't want to change it. The friend then left the group chat. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they were celebrating their birthday, so they have a right to choose how they want to spend it. They also made it clear it's optional. The friend who left might be overreacting. However, maybe the author should have considered if the movie was a good choice for the group. But the question is about being in the wrong. \n\nIf the author had agreed to change the movie to accommodate the friend, maybe that would be more considerate, but they already stated they really wanted that movie. The friend had the choice to attend or not. The author didn't force anyone to come. So probably, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
