I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and some friends not showing up after suggesting a different movie.\n\nFirst, the user planned their own birthday by picking a movie they wanted to see. They posted it in a group chat and made it optional for others to join. Most agreed, but one friend suggested changing the movie. The author refused, explaining it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. The friend then backed out and stopped talking. The author is now questioning if they should have changed the movie.\n\nSo, the main points here are: The author had the right to choose their own birthday activity. They made it clear it's optional. The friend was okay with the initial plan but later changed their mind, leading to them not attending. The author didn't force anyone to come; it was their choice. The friend might have felt their preference wasn't respected, but the author was within their rights to stick to their choice. The friends who left might be overreacting, but the author isn't wrong for not changing their plans. It's their birthday, after all. So, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
