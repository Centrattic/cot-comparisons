I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and some friends not showing up after being asked to join.\n\nFirst, the author planned to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their 20th birthday. They posted in a group chat, said it's optional for others to join. Most people agreed, but one suggested a different movie. The author stood their ground, explaining it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. Then the friend who suggested the change stopped coming and stopped talking in the group. Now the author is wondering if they should have changed the movie.\n\nSo, the key points here: the event was the author's birthday, they made it clear it's optional, they had already chosen the movie, and the friend wanted a different one. The author didn't force anyone to come; they just wanted to watch that movie. The friend's reaction seems a bit over the top. \n\nIn terms of social norms, when hosting an event like a birthday, you can have preferences. The author didn't make the movie a group decision but a personal choice. However, maybe they could have considered a compromise, but it's their birthday, so they have the right to choose. The friend who left might have felt disrespected, but the author wasn't wrong for not changing the movie. They were clear it's optional. The friend's choice to not attend is their own decision, but the author didn't have to accommodate their movie preference for their own event. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend might be the one being difficult. The author did everything right by setting expectations and being polite.\n"
