I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about choosing a movie for their 20th birthday party and getting some backlash.\n\nSo, the person wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 and invited friends to join. They made it clear it was optional. Most agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author declined, explaining it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. Then the person backed out and stopped communicating. The question is whether the author was wrong for not changing the movie.\n\nFirst, it's their birthday. People usually expect to have some say in how they celebrate their own special day. The author made it clear the movie was optional, so those who wanted to join came. Others had the choice to attend or not. The one person who didn't want to see that movie could have opted out, which they did. The author isn't obligated to change their plans just because someone else doesn't like the choice, especially when they've already given the option to join or not.\n\nAlso, the author was polite, explained their reasoning, and even suggested another time for a different movie. That shows consideration for the other person's preferences. The person who left might be oversensitive or have a problem with the choice, but that's their issue. The author isn't at fault for making a personal choice for their own celebration. \n\nSo, in this case, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They made their intentions clear, kept the invitation open, and others had the agency to participate or not. The conflict arises from the other person's reaction, not the author's decision.\n"
