I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if they're the asshole for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday, even though one person wanted a different one.\n\nFirst, it was their birthday, so they have the right to choose how they want to celebrate. They made it clear the movie was optional and asked if anyone wanted to join. Most people agreed, so the majority was on board. When one person suggested a different movie, the author stood their ground, explaining it's their birthday and they wanted to see that specific movie. The person then backed out. \n\nThe key points here: the author didn't force anyone to come, it was optional. They were respectful and even offered to see another movie another time. The person who left chose not to attend, which is their prerogative. The author isn't in the wrong because they made it clear the choice was theirs and it was optional. The friend might have felt slighted, but the author didn't do anything to force their hand. So the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
