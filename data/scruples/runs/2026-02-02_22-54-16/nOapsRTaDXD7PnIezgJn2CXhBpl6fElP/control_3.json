I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user is asking if they're the asshole for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, they decided to go see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their 20th birthday and invited a group on a group chat. They emphasized it's optional. Most people agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The user stood by their choice, and the person who suggested the change backed out and stopped participating. Now the user is wondering if they were in the wrong for not switching the movie.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and boundaries. The user made it clear it was their birthday, chose the movie, and stated it was optional. They even offered to watch another movie another day. The friend suggested a change, which the user respectfully declined, and the friend took the hint. \n\nThe user didn't force anyone to come. The friend could have attended the event as planned or decided not to. The user's actions were within their rights to choose their own celebration. The friend's reaction might be more about their own preferences or expectations, but the user isn't obligated to accommodate that unless they agreed to it. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for the host or planner of an event to have the final say, especially when they've made it clear it's their occasion. The user was clear and respectful, so there's no indication of being in the wrong here. The friend chose to step away, which is their prerogative, but the user isn't at fault for maintaining their choice.\n"
