I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for not changing their movie choice for their birthday. So, the key points here are:\n\nFirst, they organized a movie night on their birthday, choosing How to Train Your Dragon 3. They made it clear it was optional for others to join. Most people agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The user refused, stating it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. The person then backed out and stopped responding.\n\nNow, the user is questioning if they should have changed the movie. The main issue is whether their refusal was inconsiderate or if they had the right to choose their own movie.\n\nFrom what I see, the user did set expectations clearly by saying it's optional. They even offered to watch another movie another day if others wanted, which shows flexibility. The other person's reaction seems a bit extreme\u2014exercising their right not to attend after the decision was made. The user isn't wrong for wanting to celebrate their birthday as they please. People can have different preferences, but the user wasn't forced to include that person. The fact that the person left and stopped talking might be their own issue, but the user isn't in the wrong for standing by their choice. So, the answer should be B.\n"
