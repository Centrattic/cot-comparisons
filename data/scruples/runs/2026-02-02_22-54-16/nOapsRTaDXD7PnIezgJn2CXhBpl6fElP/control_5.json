I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user asked if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the scenario is about choosing a movie for their birthday and not changing it when someone else suggested another movie. \n\nFirst, the person organized the movie night as their own birthday celebration. They mentioned it was optional for others to join. Most people agreed, but one person wanted a different movie. The author stood their ground, explaining it's their birthday and they wanted to see that movie. The person then didn't come and stopped participating in the group chat.\n\nNow, considering the key points: the author made it clear it was their choice, and others were invited optionally. The person who objected didn't come, which might be a bit dramatic, but the author didn't force anyone. The author's right to choose their own celebration is important here. However, maybe there's a nuance where the group might have expected some compromise? But the author didn't pressure anyone else; they even suggested another time for a different movie. \n\nIn many cases, people might respect someone's wish for their own event. The person who left could be oversensitive, but maybe the group dynamics play a role. However, the author isn't wrong for sticking to their preference when it was their birthday. The question is whether they're in the wrong. Since they didn't make it mandatory, and the others were optional, it seems like the author isn't at fault. So the answer would be B.\n"
