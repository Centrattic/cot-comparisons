I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. The situation is that the author wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3, posted in a group chat for others to join, and when someone suggested a different movie, they refused and the person left.\n\nFirst, the author made it clear that attending was optional. They said the movie was their choice for their birthday. The person who objected then decided not to come. The author is now questioning if they were wrong to stick with their choice.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author's own birthday celebration, they specified it's optional, others agreed, then one person wanted a different movie. The author's response was to say it's their choice, and the other person walked away. \n\nI need to consider if the author overstepped. Since they made it optional, they have the right to choose their own movie for their birthday. The other person was free to not attend. The author didn't force anyone to come. The problem seems to be the other person's reaction, not the author's choice. The author is not in the wrong here. They had the right to choose their own movie for their own event. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
