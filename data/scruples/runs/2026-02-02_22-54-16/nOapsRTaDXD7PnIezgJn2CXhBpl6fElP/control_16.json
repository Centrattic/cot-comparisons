I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. So the situation is: the author wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 and invited friends. Most agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author declined, and the person then didn't come and stopped talking.\n\nFirst, the author clearly stated it was their birthday and they had chosen the movie. They made it optional to attend. So the friends who agreed were okay with it. The one person who objected then backed out. The author's reasoning is that it's their birthday, so they have the right to choose.\n\nI think the key points here are: the author made it clear the movie was their choice and that attendance was optional. The person who objected had the option to not come, but instead, they decided to not attend and stop communicating, which might be their issue. The author isn't obligated to change their plans for someone else's preference, especially when they already agreed to the original choice. So the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
