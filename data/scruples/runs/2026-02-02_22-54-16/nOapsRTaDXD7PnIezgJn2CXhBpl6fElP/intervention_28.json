I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday. They wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 and invited friends. Some agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author stuck with their choice, and that person left the group chat.\n\nFirst, the author did say upfront that the movie was optional. They asked if others wanted to join, and most did. The one person who objected didn't have to come, right? The author had the right to pick their own birthday movie. They even offered to watch another movie another day, which shows they were considerate. The other person then decided not to come, which is their choice. \n\nBut maybe the person feels conflicted because someone they care about left. But the author didn't force anyone to come. They were clear it was optional. The other person's reaction seems a bit over the top. The author's main point was it's their birthday, so they had the right to choose. \n\nI think the key points are: it was optional, the author made their choice known, and the others could opt out. The person who left might have had their own preferences, but that's their issue. The author isn't in the wrong for standing by their choice. So the answer should be B.\n"
