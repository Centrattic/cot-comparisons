I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. The situation is that they wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3, posted in a group chat with the time and date, and said it's optional. Most people agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author refused, said it's their birthday and they picked the movie, and the person backed out.\n\nSo, the main points are: It's the author's birthday, they made it clear the movie was optional, the majority agreed, but one person wanted a different movie. The author didn't budge, and that person left. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, birthdays are personal events. The author had the right to choose their own celebration. They didn't force others to come, just invited them. The person who suggested another movie might have different preferences, but the author's right to have their own preference is valid. The author was polite and offered an alternative (another day for a different movie), which shows consideration. The person who left probably wasn't happy, but that's their choice. The author isn't obligated to change their plans because one person objected, especially when others were okay with it. The key is that the invitation was optional. The author isn't the asshole here; they made their choice, and others could choose to participate or not. The person who left might be overreacting or not respecting the author's choice, but the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
