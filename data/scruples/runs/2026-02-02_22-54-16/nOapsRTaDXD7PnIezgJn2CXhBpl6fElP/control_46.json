I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday.\n\nSo, the person wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their birthday and invited friends via a group chat. They made it clear it was optional. Most friends agreed, but one person suggested changing the movie. The author refused, saying it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. Then the person who suggested changing the movie backed out and stopped talking in the group chat. The author is now questioning if they should have changed the movie.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. The author organized the event for their own birthday, made it clear it was optional, and most people were okay with it. The one person had a different preference but the author didn't have to accommodate that since it's their event. The person then didn't attend. \n\nIs the author at fault? Well, they didn't force anyone to come. They were clear about the movie being their choice. The person who didn't come might be acting out because of their preference not being met, but that's their choice. The author isn't in the wrong for sticking to their own event. However, maybe there's a nuance where considering others' feelings could be important. But the author did say it was optional, so it's their right to choose. \n\nIn AITA posts, usually, if someone is the host and makes it clear it's optional, they aren't the asshole if they stick to their decision. The person who left the group chat might be at fault for not respecting the host's choice and then cutting off communication. So, the answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
