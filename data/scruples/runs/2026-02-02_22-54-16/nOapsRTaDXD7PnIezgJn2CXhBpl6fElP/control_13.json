I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their own birthday and some friends not showing up after suggesting a different movie.\n\nFirst, the author planned to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their 20th birthday. They posted in a group chat with the time and asked if others wanted to join, making it clear it was optional. Most agreed, but one person suggested changing the movie. The author declined, explaining it's their birthday and they wanted that movie, offering to see another movie another day. The friend then backed out and stopped participating in the group chat.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for not changing the movie. Let's break it down. The key points here are the author's right to choose their own celebration and the friend's reaction. The author made it clear that attending was optional, so those who came did so voluntarily. The one friend who pushed for a different movie might have expected the author to compromise, but the author had the right to set their own terms for their birthday. \n\nThe friend's response of not showing up seems like a punishment for not meeting their preference, which might be unreasonable. The author wasn't obligated to change the movie since it was their birthday. However, maybe the friend felt slighted because their preference wasn't considered. But since the author was clear from the start that it was optional and they had chosen the movie, it's hard to say the author is wrong here. \n\nAlso, the author offered an alternative (seeing another movie another day), which shows they were open to future plans but wanted this specific movie for their birthday. The friend's reaction seems more about not getting their way rather than the author being inconsiderate. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, usually, if someone is hosting an event or making plans for their own occasion, they have the right to set the terms. The friends who agreed to come understood the movie beforehand. The one who didn't come might have misread the situation by expecting the author to change plans based on their suggestion. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They made it clear it was their choice and the event was optional. The friend's reaction is more about their own expectations not being met, not the author's wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
