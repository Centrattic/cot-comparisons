I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not changing the movie for their birthday. The scenario is that the person chose a movie for their own birthday celebration and invited friends. When someone suggested changing it, they refused and ended up not going.\n\nFirst, the person made it clear it's their birthday movie choice. They said it's optional to attend. So, they're not forcing anyone to come. When a friend wanted a different movie, the person stood by their choice, which is reasonable for their own event. The friend then backed out. \n\nThe key points here: the person owns their choice, made it optional, and didn't pressure others. The friend didn't have to come, and their reaction might be about not getting their way. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing their own preferences on their birthday. The friend's disappointment isn't the author's fault. So, the answer is B.\n"
