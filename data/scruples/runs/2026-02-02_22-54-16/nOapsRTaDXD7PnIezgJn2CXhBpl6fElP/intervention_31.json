I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the story is the asshole (AITA) for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. The scenario is that they wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3, invited friends optionally, and when one person suggested changing the movie, the author stood their ground, leading the friend to back out.\n\nFirst, the key points here: the author made it clear the movie was optional. They invited people but didn't pressure anyone to come. When someone suggested a different movie, the author explained it was their birthday choice and offered to see another movie another time. The friend then chose not to come and stopped talking in the group chat.\n\nNow, considering social norms and expectations. When you host an event, especially something like a birthday movie, it's generally acceptable to choose the activity, especially when you've made it optional. The friend's reaction seems a bit extreme. They had the choice to attend or not. The author wasn't forcing anyone to come, so it's not their fault the friend didn't like the movie choice. The friend's withdrawal was their own decision based on the movie selection, which the author had the right to make for their own celebration.\n\nAlso, the author was polite and offered alternatives. They didn't dismiss the friend's suggestion but suggested another time. The friend's response of stopping communication is more indicative of their own issue rather than the author's wrongdoing. The author's main goal was to enjoy their birthday as planned, and they communicated that clearly.\n\nSo, based on this, the author isn't in the wrong. They followed through on their own plans after considering the input. The friend chose to disengage, which is their prerogative, but it doesn't make the author the asshole. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
