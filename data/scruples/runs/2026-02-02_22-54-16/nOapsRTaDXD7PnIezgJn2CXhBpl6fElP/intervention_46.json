I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. The situation is that they wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 and invited friends, but when someone suggested changing the movie, they refused and the friend stopped talking.\n\nFirst, it's their birthday, so they have the right to choose how they want to celebrate. They made it clear the movie was optional and that others didn't have to join. The friend had the option not to come if they didn't like the movie choice. The author didn't force anyone to attend, so they're not being inconsiderate. The friend's reaction seems a bit harsh, but maybe they were expecting the author to be more flexible. However, the author made it their own celebration, so they're not obligated to change their plans. The key points are that the invitation was optional, the author communicated clearly, and the friend chose to opt out. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
