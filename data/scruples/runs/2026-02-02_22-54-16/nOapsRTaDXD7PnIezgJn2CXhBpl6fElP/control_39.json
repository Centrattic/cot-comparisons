I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their own birthday and not changing it when someone suggested a different one.\n\nSo the user wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 and invited people to join. They made it clear it's optional. Some people agreed, but one person wanted a different movie. The user stood their ground, and the person left the group chat.\n\nHmm. The key points here are that it's the user's birthday, they set the movie choice, and it was optional. The person who didn't come didn't have to participate. The user didn't force others to come. So maybe the user isn't in the wrong because it's their choice for their own celebration. The other person could have chosen not to come if they didn't like the movie. The user was respectful, offered flexibility for another day, but was clear about their preference. So the answer is probably B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
