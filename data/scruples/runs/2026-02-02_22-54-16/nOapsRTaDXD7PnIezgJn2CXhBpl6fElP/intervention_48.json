I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about them choosing a movie for their birthday and some friends not wanting to go because they wanted a different movie.\n\nFirst, the person explicitly said it was their birthday and they chose the movie. They mentioned it was optional for others to join. Most friends agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author stood by their choice, and that friend didn't come. \n\nSo, the key points here: the author had the right to choose their own birthday activity. They made it clear it was optional. The friend had the choice to attend or not. The author didn't force anyone. They even offered to see another movie another time. \n\nSome might argue that maybe the author should've been more accommodating, but since it's their birthday, they have the right to make the decisions. The friend's choice to leave is their own decision, not the author's fault. \n\nI think the author is in the right. Answer B.\n"
