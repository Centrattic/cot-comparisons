I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. The situation is that they invited friends to a movie, which they picked because it's their birthday. One friend suggested a different movie, and when the author refused, that friend backed out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author made it clear it was optional for others to join. They chose the movie as part of their birthday celebration, which is a personal choice. The friend suggested a different movie, but the author stood by their choice. The friend then decided not to come, which is their own choice. \n\nThe main issue here is whether the author's refusal to change the movie makes them the asshole. The author was upfront that the movie was their choice and that others weren't obligated to attend. The friend's withdrawal is a result of their own preference, not a betrayal on the author's part. \n\nIn social situations, people have the right to make personal choices, especially regarding their own events. The author isn't forcing anyone to attend. The friend's reaction might indicate they were more interested in watching a different movie, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author was wrong to stick with their choice. \n\nIt's important to note that the author didn't make the event mandatory. The friend's decision to leave the group chat after the author's refusal is the friend's own action. The author isn't at fault for not accommodating a last-minute change to their plans when they had already communicated their preference and the event was optional.\n"
