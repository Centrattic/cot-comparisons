I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their own birthday and some friends wanting to change it.\n\nFirst, the author planned to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their birthday and invited friends. They made it clear it was optional. Most agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author stood by their choice, explaining it's their birthday and they really wanted to see that movie. The person then backed out and stopped participating in the group chat.\n\nThe key points here are that the author clearly stated it was their choice and made the movie optional. They also offered the possibility of another movie on another day. The friend's response was to withdraw from the plans, which seems like their own choice. The author isn't forcing anyone to come; it's their birthday, and they have the right to make their own plans. The friend's reaction might be overreacting, but the author isn't in the wrong for sticking to their preference. The author was considerate by making it optional and suggested alternatives. So, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
