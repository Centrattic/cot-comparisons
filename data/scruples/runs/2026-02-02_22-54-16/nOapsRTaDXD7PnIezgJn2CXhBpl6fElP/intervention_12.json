I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the story is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and not changing it when someone else suggested a different one.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author planned to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their birthday as a solo celebration. They invited friends via group chat, made it clear it's optional. Most agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author explained it's their birthday and they wanted that movie, so others left the group chat.\n\nNow, considering the author's actions: they invited people, made it optional, and when someone requested a change, they stood by their choice. The person who suggested the change ended up not coming. The author isn't forcing anyone to come; they just wanted to see the movie they chose. \n\nThe person who left might be inconsiderate for backing out and not respecting the author's choice. The author didn't do anything wrong by not changing their plans. They were clear about it being their birthday and their choice. \n\nPossible angles to consider: Did the author have a responsibility to accommodate the other person's preference? Since the invite was optional, the author isn't obligated. The other person chose to withdraw, which is their right, but that doesn't make the author wrong. \n\nAlso, the author was respectful in their response, suggesting another movie on another day. So there's no evidence of rudeness. The issue is about personal choice versus group compromise. The author's choice isn't unreasonable. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They made it clear it's optional, stood by their decision, and handled it politely. The other person's reaction was their own choice, not the author's fault.\n"
