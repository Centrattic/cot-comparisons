I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted this is the asshole for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. The situation is that they wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 on their 20th birthday and invited friends. Most agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The poster refused, saying it's their birthday and the chosen movie, so they stuck with it. The person who suggested another movie then backed out and stopped talking in the group chat.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the poster was wrong. The key points here are autonomy over their own celebration and the social dynamics. Since it's the poster's birthday, they have the right to choose how to celebrate. They did mention the movie was optional, so the friends who came were there by choice. The person who objected didn't have the authority to demand a change, and the poster was reasonable in standing by their choice. The other person's reaction of backing out might be hurt feelings, but that doesn't make the poster wrong. Also, the poster offered to watch another movie another day, which shows they were considerate of others' preferences. The main issue is that the objector didn't respect the poster's choice, not the other way around. So the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
