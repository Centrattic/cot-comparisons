Today I had a very important test and I wanted to be sure to arrive early and study some more at school so I went out to take the bus one and a half hour before the test. Unfortunately it seems that this morning was particularly busy because it took ONE HOUR for the bus to pass. So there I was, waiting for the transport without the opportunity to study because I might get distracted and miss it (there weren't any benches either, I had to stand still). About five minutes before the bus arrived, a pregnant woman and her friend left their house (which means they didn't had to wait an hour in the heat like me) and took the same bus I was waiting for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis bus was particularly full of people (and I mean full, there were persons standing) but for some reason two seats were available (I think it was because the sun shined at full force directly on them, but I didn't care)  so I took one of them, put on my headphones without music to drown some sound and started studying. The pregnant woman also took seat besides me, chatting with her friend who was standing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout five minutes in the route, the friend complained about her feet, so the pregnant one offered her the seat, which she happily accepted. Then it happened. The pregnant woman started complaining too. And instead of giving back the seat to her pregnant friend, the other woman asked me if I would give up my seat for her. I had my headphones so I pretended I didn't hear anything. After asking me two more times, the friend pulled out one headphone off my ear and, with a less-than-friendly tone, asked me again. I, of course, refused, arguing that the one who should give up the seat was her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe went nuts and harassed me for the entire ride. Called me names, put her hand on my notebook so I couldn't see anything and refused to give my headphone back unless I gave up my seat, while the pregnant woman only stared at me with the deadliest glare ever. I also heard the passengers talking about me, though some of them saw what happened and defended me. Still, that was one hell of a ride and I can't stop thinking about if I did the correct thing. So, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for refusing to give up their seat to a pregnant woman on a bus.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author was waiting for a very crowded bus for an hour, standing, because there were no benches. When the bus arrived, even though it was full, there were two seats available where the sun was shining. The author took one seat to study for an important test. A pregnant woman and her friend got on and the pregnant woman sat next to the author. Then, the friend complained about her feet, so the pregnant woman gave her seat. Then the pregnant woman herself started complaining and the friend asked the author to give up their seat. The author refused, leading to harassment from the friend.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. So, the question is whether the author did the right thing by not giving up the seat. \n\nI need to consider social norms. In many places, there's an unspoken rule to offer seats to pregnant women, elderly, or those with disabilities. But the author had been waiting a long time, standing, and needed the seat to study. The pregnant woman had a seat, then gave it to her friend. So maybe the author's refusal is justified because the pregnant woman already had a seat and gave it up. The friend was the one who needed the seat now, not the pregnant woman. \n\nAlso, the author was being harassed, and others defended them. So maybe the real issue was the friend's behavior. The author was in a time-sensitive situation. \n\nBut some might argue that the pregnant woman's needs are more pressing. However, the author didn't refuse the pregnant woman directly; the friend was the one asking. The friend took it upon herself to ask the author, which might not be the right approach. \n\nSo considering all this, the author probably isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
