Today I had a very important test and I wanted to be sure to arrive early and study some more at school so I went out to take the bus one and a half hour before the test. Unfortunately it seems that this morning was particularly busy because it took ONE HOUR for the bus to pass. So there I was, waiting for the transport without the opportunity to study because I might get distracted and miss it (there weren't any benches either, I had to stand still). About five minutes before the bus arrived, a pregnant woman and her friend left their house (which means they didn't had to wait an hour in the heat like me) and took the same bus I was waiting for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis bus was particularly full of people (and I mean full, there were persons standing) but for some reason two seats were available (I think it was because the sun shined at full force directly on them, but I didn't care)  so I took one of them, put on my headphones without music to drown some sound and started studying. The pregnant woman also took seat besides me, chatting with her friend who was standing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout five minutes in the route, the friend complained about her feet, so the pregnant one offered her the seat, which she happily accepted. Then it happened. The pregnant woman started complaining too. And instead of giving back the seat to her pregnant friend, the other woman asked me if I would give up my seat for her. I had my headphones so I pretended I didn't hear anything. After asking me two more times, the friend pulled out one headphone off my ear and, with a less-than-friendly tone, asked me again. I, of course, refused, arguing that the one who should give up the seat was her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe went nuts and harassed me for the entire ride. Called me names, put her hand on my notebook so I couldn't see anything and refused to give my headphone back unless I gave up my seat, while the pregnant woman only stared at me with the deadliest glare ever. I also heard the passengers talking about me, though some of them saw what happened and defended me. Still, that was one hell of a ride and I can't stop thinking about if I did the correct thing. So, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong for refusing to give up their seat to a pregnant woman on a crowded bus. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: The person had an important test and left early to study on the bus. The bus was very full, but there were two seats available, which they took. The pregnant woman and her friend arrived later, took the bus, and the friend then took the seat from the pregnant woman. The friend then approached the AITA to ask for the seat, leading to a confrontation.\n\nThe AITA refused, thinking the pregnant woman should have the seat back. The other woman got aggressive, took out the headphones, and harassed them. The AITA is now questioning if they were wrong.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and etiquette: Typically, people are encouraged to offer seats to those who might need it more, like pregnant women, elderly, or disabled. However, the AITA was also in a situation where they had a valid reason to need the seat (studying for an important test). The bus was crowded, so there weren't many seats anyway. The pregnant woman initially had the seat, then gave it to her friend. There's a question here about whether the friend taking the seat was appropriate, but the AITA was seated first.\n\nAnother point is that the other woman's actions seemed aggressive and inappropriate. She took the headphones off uninvited and harassed the AITA. The pregnant woman didn't intervene, which might indicate she didn't mind the seat being given away, or perhaps she was complicit. However, the AITA's refusal to give up the seat when the wrong person was asking might be justified. The AITA didn't want to give their seat to someone who had already taken it from the pregnant woman, not the pregnant woman herself.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the AITA wasn't in a position where they could know if the pregnant woman needed the seat. The friend's request was on behalf of the pregnant woman, but since the seat was already taken from her by her friend, the AITA might not be at fault for refusing to give up the seat when the request was from the friend, not the pregnant woman. Additionally, the AITA was using the seat for a valid reason (studying) and the other woman's behavior escalated the situation unnecessarily.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the AITA isn't necessarily in the wrong. They were in a stressful situation, had a legitimate need to study, and the other party's actions were aggressive. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
