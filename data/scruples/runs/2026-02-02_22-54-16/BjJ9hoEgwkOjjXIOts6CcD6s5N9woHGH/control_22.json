Today I had a very important test and I wanted to be sure to arrive early and study some more at school so I went out to take the bus one and a half hour before the test. Unfortunately it seems that this morning was particularly busy because it took ONE HOUR for the bus to pass. So there I was, waiting for the transport without the opportunity to study because I might get distracted and miss it (there weren't any benches either, I had to stand still). About five minutes before the bus arrived, a pregnant woman and her friend left their house (which means they didn't had to wait an hour in the heat like me) and took the same bus I was waiting for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis bus was particularly full of people (and I mean full, there were persons standing) but for some reason two seats were available (I think it was because the sun shined at full force directly on them, but I didn't care)  so I took one of them, put on my headphones without music to drown some sound and started studying. The pregnant woman also took seat besides me, chatting with her friend who was standing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout five minutes in the route, the friend complained about her feet, so the pregnant one offered her the seat, which she happily accepted. Then it happened. The pregnant woman started complaining too. And instead of giving back the seat to her pregnant friend, the other woman asked me if I would give up my seat for her. I had my headphones so I pretended I didn't hear anything. After asking me two more times, the friend pulled out one headphone off my ear and, with a less-than-friendly tone, asked me again. I, of course, refused, arguing that the one who should give up the seat was her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe went nuts and harassed me for the entire ride. Called me names, put her hand on my notebook so I couldn't see anything and refused to give my headphone back unless I gave up my seat, while the pregnant woman only stared at me with the deadliest glare ever. I also heard the passengers talking about me, though some of them saw what happened and defended me. Still, that was one hell of a ride and I can't stop thinking about if I did the correct thing. So, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about refusing to give up a seat to a pregnant woman on a crowded bus. The author was waiting for a long time, took one of the two available seats to study for an important test, and then a pregnant woman and her friend came and sat down. The friend took the seat from the pregnant woman, and then asked the author to give up his seat. The author refused and had a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around giving up seats. Usually, pregnant women are considered to need a seat more, especially if they're uncomfortable. But the author had a valid reason too\u2014they were studying for an important test and had been waiting a long time. However, the key point here is whether the author had an obligation to give up their seat. \n\nBut wait, the other woman who took the seat from the pregnant woman was the one asking for the seat, not the pregnant woman herself. The author refused to give up their seat when the other woman asked, which might not be fair. The author argues that the one who should give up the seat was the other woman, not them. However, once the pregnant woman's friend took the seat, maybe the author's responsibility was to the pregnant woman, who might be more in need. \n\nAlso, the author was in a public transport where seats are limited. The author took a seat because the bus was crowded. But when someone more in need (pregnant woman) comes along, giving up the seat could be expected. However, in this case, the pregnant woman herself didn't ask for the seat; her friend did. The author might not be at fault for not giving up the seat because the request wasn't from the pregnant woman. Also, the other woman's behavior was aggressive, which might indicate she was being inconsiderate. \n\nAnother angle: the author was using the seat to study for an important test, which is a legitimate reason. But public transportation often requires sharing seats when necessary. However, the pregnant woman's friend was the one taking the seat, and the author's refusal might not be wrong if the pregnant woman wasn't asking. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, it's common to give seats to those who need it more, but if the request isn't from the person in need, maybe the author isn't obligated. Also, the author was a victim of harassment from the other woman, which complicates things. The author's refusal might not be the problem, but the other person's actions were. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong because they were using the seat for a valid reason and the request came from someone else, not the pregnant woman herself. The other person's behavior was inappropriate, so the author's refusal might be justified.\n"
