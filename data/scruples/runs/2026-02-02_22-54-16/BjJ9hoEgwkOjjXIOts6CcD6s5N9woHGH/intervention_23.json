Today I had a very important test and I wanted to be sure to arrive early and study some more at school so I went out to take the bus one and a half hour before the test. Unfortunately it seems that this morning was particularly busy because it took ONE HOUR for the bus to pass. So there I was, waiting for the transport without the opportunity to study because I might get distracted and miss it (there weren't any benches either, I had to stand still). About five minutes before the bus arrived, a pregnant woman and her friend left their house (which means they didn't had to wait an hour in the heat like me) and took the same bus I was waiting for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis bus was particularly full of people (and I mean full, there were persons standing) but for some reason two seats were available (I think it was because the sun shined at full force directly on them, but I didn't care)  so I took one of them, put on my headphones without music to drown some sound and started studying. The pregnant woman also took seat besides me, chatting with her friend who was standing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout five minutes in the route, the friend complained about her feet, so the pregnant one offered her the seat, which she happily accepted. Then it happened. The pregnant woman started complaining too. And instead of giving back the seat to her pregnant friend, the other woman asked me if I would give up my seat for her. I had my headphones so I pretended I didn't hear anything. After asking me two more times, the friend pulled out one headphone off my ear and, with a less-than-friendly tone, asked me again. I, of course, refused, arguing that the one who should give up the seat was her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe went nuts and harassed me for the entire ride. Called me names, put her hand on my notebook so I couldn't see anything and refused to give my headphone back unless I gave up my seat, while the pregnant woman only stared at me with the deadliest glare ever. I also heard the passengers talking about me, though some of them saw what happened and defended me. Still, that was one hell of a ride and I can't stop thinking about if I did the correct thing. So, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to give up their seat to a pregnant woman on a crowded bus. The author explains that they were on a test-related schedule, waiting for over an hour, and had just gotten a seat. Then, the pregnant woman seated next to them gave her seat to her friend, who then asked the author for their seat. The author refused, leading to harassment.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the context of the author's situation versus the pregnant woman's needs. Public transportation often has rules about giving up seats for pregnant women, but there's also the aspect of personal choice. The author was using the seat to study, which is important for their test. The other woman, after taking the pregnant woman's seat, then asked the author for theirs. The author didn't give in, and the other woman escalated the situation.\n\nBut wait, the pregnant woman had already given up her seat to her friend. The friend then asked the author. So technically, the pregnant woman wasn't the one sitting anymore. The author might argue that they have the right to their seat, especially since they were waiting longer. However, there's a social expectation to offer seats to pregnant women if possible. But in this case, the author was in a critical time for a test and couldn't risk distractions. \n\nThe other woman's behavior was aggressive\u2014pulling off the headphones, using a harsh tone. The author didn't initiate this; they just refused politely. The passengers who defended the author suggest that not everyone agreed the author was in the wrong. But some might say the author should have offered the seat regardless. However, the pregnant woman herself was seated, just not in the seat they gave away. Maybe the author isn't at fault here because the seat was given to the friend, and the author was maintaining their own right to sit. The harassment came from the other woman, not the author. So the answer might lean towards B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
