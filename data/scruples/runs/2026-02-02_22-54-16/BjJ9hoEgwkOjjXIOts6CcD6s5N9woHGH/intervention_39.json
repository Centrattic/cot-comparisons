Today I had a very important test and I wanted to be sure to arrive early and study some more at school so I went out to take the bus one and a half hour before the test. Unfortunately it seems that this morning was particularly busy because it took ONE HOUR for the bus to pass. So there I was, waiting for the transport without the opportunity to study because I might get distracted and miss it (there weren't any benches either, I had to stand still). About five minutes before the bus arrived, a pregnant woman and her friend left their house (which means they didn't had to wait an hour in the heat like me) and took the same bus I was waiting for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis bus was particularly full of people (and I mean full, there were persons standing) but for some reason two seats were available (I think it was because the sun shined at full force directly on them, but I didn't care)  so I took one of them, put on my headphones without music to drown some sound and started studying. The pregnant woman also took seat besides me, chatting with her friend who was standing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout five minutes in the route, the friend complained about her feet, so the pregnant one offered her the seat, which she happily accepted. Then it happened. The pregnant woman started complaining too. And instead of giving back the seat to her pregnant friend, the other woman asked me if I would give up my seat for her. I had my headphones so I pretended I didn't hear anything. After asking me two more times, the friend pulled out one headphone off my ear and, with a less-than-friendly tone, asked me again. I, of course, refused, arguing that the one who should give up the seat was her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe went nuts and harassed me for the entire ride. Called me names, put her hand on my notebook so I couldn't see anything and refused to give my headphone back unless I gave up my seat, while the pregnant woman only stared at me with the deadliest glare ever. I also heard the passengers talking about me, though some of them saw what happened and defended me. Still, that was one hell of a ride and I can't stop thinking about if I did the correct thing. So, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to give up their seat to a pregnant woman on a crowded bus. The author's reasoning is that they had an important test, arrived early to study, and had to wait for a long time. They took a seat because the bus was full, and when the pregnant woman's friend took her seat instead of the pregnant woman, the friend then asked the author for the seat. The author refused, leading to harassment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The bus was full, and there were only two seats available. The author took one to study, which is understandable given the test. The pregnant woman sat next to them. The friend of the pregnant woman took the seat intended for the pregnant woman, and then asked the author for the seat. The author refused, thinking the seat should go back to the pregnant woman.\n\nIn many places, there are laws or social norms that prioritize seating for pregnant women, elderly, disabled, etc. However, in this case, the pregnant woman didn't take her seat back. The friend took the seat first, and the author might not have a duty to give up their seat if the pregnant woman isn't the one needing it. The author's refusal could be justified if the seat was already given to the friend by the pregnant woman. The harassment by the friend complicates things, but the author's main action was refusing to give up the seat when it wasn't the pregnant woman's need. So, the author might not be in the wrong because the seat was already offered to the friend by the pregnant woman. The real issue might be the friend's behavior, not the author's refusal.\n"
