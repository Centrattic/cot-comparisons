Today I had a very important test and I wanted to be sure to arrive early and study some more at school so I went out to take the bus one and a half hour before the test. Unfortunately it seems that this morning was particularly busy because it took ONE HOUR for the bus to pass. So there I was, waiting for the transport without the opportunity to study because I might get distracted and miss it (there weren't any benches either, I had to stand still). About five minutes before the bus arrived, a pregnant woman and her friend left their house (which means they didn't had to wait an hour in the heat like me) and took the same bus I was waiting for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis bus was particularly full of people (and I mean full, there were persons standing) but for some reason two seats were available (I think it was because the sun shined at full force directly on them, but I didn't care)  so I took one of them, put on my headphones without music to drown some sound and started studying. The pregnant woman also took seat besides me, chatting with her friend who was standing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout five minutes in the route, the friend complained about her feet, so the pregnant one offered her the seat, which she happily accepted. Then it happened. The pregnant woman started complaining too. And instead of giving back the seat to her pregnant friend, the other woman asked me if I would give up my seat for her. I had my headphones so I pretended I didn't hear anything. After asking me two more times, the friend pulled out one headphone off my ear and, with a less-than-friendly tone, asked me again. I, of course, refused, arguing that the one who should give up the seat was her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe went nuts and harassed me for the entire ride. Called me names, put her hand on my notebook so I couldn't see anything and refused to give my headphone back unless I gave up my seat, while the pregnant woman only stared at me with the deadliest glare ever. I also heard the passengers talking about me, though some of them saw what happened and defended me. Still, that was one hell of a ride and I can't stop thinking about if I did the correct thing. So, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for refusing to give up their seat to a pregnant woman on the bus. Let me read through the details again to make sure I understand the situation.\n\nThe author was waiting for a bus for a long time, an hour, in the heat, without benches. They stood the whole time because the bus was full. Then, just before the bus arrived, a pregnant woman and her friend showed up and got on the bus. The bus was packed, but there were two seats available, which the author took to study for an important test. The pregnant woman sat next to them, and her friend asked the author to give up their seat. The author refused, leading to harassment and conflict.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. First, the author had been waiting for a long time in uncomfortable conditions. They took a seat when it was available, which they needed to study for a test. The pregnant woman and her friend arrived later, but the friend then took the author's seat. The pregnant woman then asked the author to give up their seat, but the author refused. The key points here are the context of the author's situation versus the pregnant woman's needs.\n\nIn many places, there are policies about giving up seats for pregnant women, especially if they're visibly uncomfortable. However, the author was also in a time-sensitive situation for their test. But wait, the friend took the author's seat, not the pregnant woman. The pregnant woman then asked the author to give up the seat, but the seat was already given to the friend. The author might argue that the seat should go to someone more in need, like the pregnant woman, but the friend had already taken the author's seat. However, the author was holding their seat to study, which is a valid need too.\n\nAnother angle: the author had been waiting longer, in worse conditions. The pregnant woman's friend had the option to take the seat from the author, which might have been inappropriate if the seat was already occupied. But the author's refusal to give it up after the exchange might be seen as being inconsiderate. However, the situation escalated when the friend pulled off the author's headphones and harassed them. The author's response was to stand their ground, which might be defensible given the harassment they faced.\n\nBut legally or socially, is there an obligation to give up a seat? In some places, there are laws or etiquette that prioritize certain groups. If the pregnant woman is considered a priority, the author might be expected to give up their seat. However, if the author was using the seat to prepare for a test and the seat was already given to the friend, maybe the responsibility shifts.\n\nAlso, the friend's actions in taking the seat and then harassing the author could be the main issue here. The author might not be at fault for standing up for themselves against harassment. The fact that some passengers defended the author suggests that there's ambiguity in the situation. \n\nSo, considering all factors: the author's legitimate need to study, the long wait, the harassment from the friend, and the fact that the seat was already taken by the friend, the author might not be in the wrong. But there's a counterpoint that pregnant women should be prioritized. However, the author wasn't directly refusing the pregnant woman but the friend, and the friend was already in the seat. The author's refusal might be justified given the context.\n"
