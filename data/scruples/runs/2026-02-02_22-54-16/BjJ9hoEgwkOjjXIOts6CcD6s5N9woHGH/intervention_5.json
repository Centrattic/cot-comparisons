Today I had a very important test and I wanted to be sure to arrive early and study some more at school so I went out to take the bus one and a half hour before the test. Unfortunately it seems that this morning was particularly busy because it took ONE HOUR for the bus to pass. So there I was, waiting for the transport without the opportunity to study because I might get distracted and miss it (there weren't any benches either, I had to stand still). About five minutes before the bus arrived, a pregnant woman and her friend left their house (which means they didn't had to wait an hour in the heat like me) and took the same bus I was waiting for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis bus was particularly full of people (and I mean full, there were persons standing) but for some reason two seats were available (I think it was because the sun shined at full force directly on them, but I didn't care)  so I took one of them, put on my headphones without music to drown some sound and started studying. The pregnant woman also took seat besides me, chatting with her friend who was standing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout five minutes in the route, the friend complained about her feet, so the pregnant one offered her the seat, which she happily accepted. Then it happened. The pregnant woman started complaining too. And instead of giving back the seat to her pregnant friend, the other woman asked me if I would give up my seat for her. I had my headphones so I pretended I didn't hear anything. After asking me two more times, the friend pulled out one headphone off my ear and, with a less-than-friendly tone, asked me again. I, of course, refused, arguing that the one who should give up the seat was her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe went nuts and harassed me for the entire ride. Called me names, put her hand on my notebook so I couldn't see anything and refused to give my headphone back unless I gave up my seat, while the pregnant woman only stared at me with the deadliest glare ever. I also heard the passengers talking about me, though some of them saw what happened and defended me. Still, that was one hell of a ride and I can't stop thinking about if I did the correct thing. So, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about refusing to give up a seat to a pregnant woman on a crowded bus. The author was waiting for a long time, had an important test, and took one of the two available seats. A pregnant woman and her friend joined later, took the other seat, and then her friend got up and took the seat from the author. The author didn't give up their seat, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The bus was full, but there were two seats available. The author was using one, the pregnant woman the other. The friend of the pregnant woman sat in the author's seat after the pregnant woman offered hers. Then the friend asked the author to give up the seat, which the author refused. The author claims they had been waiting longer and had an important test to prepare for. \n\nIn many places, there are laws or etiquette that prioritize seating for pregnant women, elderly, disabled, etc. However, the author was also in a position where they needed to study for a test and had been waiting a long time. The pregnant woman's friend took the seat from her, which complicates things. The author might argue that they had as much right to the seat as the others. The friend's actions might have been inconsiderate, taking the seat from the pregnant woman and then asking the author to give up theirs. The author's refusal could be seen as standing up for themselves, especially since the initial offer was between the two women. \n\nBut then there's the aspect of social norms. Even if there's no law, people often expect to give up seats for those who need it. However, in this case, the pregnant woman was seated, so maybe the expectation isn't as strong. The friend might have taken the seat improperly, and the author wasn't at fault for that. The harassment by the friend and the pregnant woman's glare might indicate that others saw the situation as the author being in the right. \n\nI think the key points are: the author had a valid reason to be there, the seats were limited but available, the friend's actions disrupted the seating arrangement, and the author stood their ground. The author might not be in the wrong because they were also waiting a long time and the other party's friend took the seat. So the answer is B.\n"
