Today I had a very important test and I wanted to be sure to arrive early and study some more at school so I went out to take the bus one and a half hour before the test. Unfortunately it seems that this morning was particularly busy because it took ONE HOUR for the bus to pass. So there I was, waiting for the transport without the opportunity to study because I might get distracted and miss it (there weren't any benches either, I had to stand still). About five minutes before the bus arrived, a pregnant woman and her friend left their house (which means they didn't had to wait an hour in the heat like me) and took the same bus I was waiting for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis bus was particularly full of people (and I mean full, there were persons standing) but for some reason two seats were available (I think it was because the sun shined at full force directly on them, but I didn't care)  so I took one of them, put on my headphones without music to drown some sound and started studying. The pregnant woman also took seat besides me, chatting with her friend who was standing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout five minutes in the route, the friend complained about her feet, so the pregnant one offered her the seat, which she happily accepted. Then it happened. The pregnant woman started complaining too. And instead of giving back the seat to her pregnant friend, the other woman asked me if I would give up my seat for her. I had my headphones so I pretended I didn't hear anything. After asking me two more times, the friend pulled out one headphone off my ear and, with a less-than-friendly tone, asked me again. I, of course, refused, arguing that the one who should give up the seat was her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe went nuts and harassed me for the entire ride. Called me names, put her hand on my notebook so I couldn't see anything and refused to give my headphone back unless I gave up my seat, while the pregnant woman only stared at me with the deadliest glare ever. I also heard the passengers talking about me, though some of them saw what happened and defended me. Still, that was one hell of a ride and I can't stop thinking about if I did the correct thing. So, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about refusing to give up a seat to a pregnant woman on a crowded bus. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, the context. The author was waiting for a bus for a long time, an hour, and was going to an important test, so they wanted to study while waiting. The bus was full, but there were two seats available, maybe because of the sun. The author took one, and a pregnant woman sat next to them. Her friend took the seat from her. Then the friend complained, the pregnant woman offered her seat, the friend took it. Then the pregnant woman started complaining too, and the friend asked the author to give up their seat. The author refused, had a conflict, and the friend harassed them.\n\nNow, the key points. The pregnant woman initially had the seat but gave it to her friend. The friend then occupied the seat, and the pregnant woman was left standing. The author is refusing to give up their seat to the pregnant woman when asked. \n\nIn many places, there are laws or social norms about giving up seats to pregnant women or people with needs. But the question is whether the author did something wrong. The author had a reason: they were going to an important test, had waited a long time, and were trying to study. The pregnant woman's friend took her seat, so maybe the author is right to not give up their seat to someone who had the chance to sit earlier but didn't need to. Also, the friend was the one who was supposed to give back the seat, not the author.\n\nBut the pregnant woman might still need a seat. However, in this case, the author was already seated because the seats were available. The friend took the pregnant woman's seat, so the author might not be responsible for that. The author's refusal could be justified because it's not their seat to give up, especially if the pregnant woman's own friend took her seat first. Plus, the author was in a stressful situation with a test, which adds context.\n\nThe harassment from the friend is also a problem. Maybe the author is not in the wrong because they were just trying to study and the other person was being aggressive. The author's actions were within their rights since the seats were available for everyone, and the pregnant woman's friend was the one who moved into the seat. The author isn't obligated to give up their seat unless there's a specific rule requiring it. So, I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
