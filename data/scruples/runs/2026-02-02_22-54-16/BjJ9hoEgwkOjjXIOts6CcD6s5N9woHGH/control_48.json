Today I had a very important test and I wanted to be sure to arrive early and study some more at school so I went out to take the bus one and a half hour before the test. Unfortunately it seems that this morning was particularly busy because it took ONE HOUR for the bus to pass. So there I was, waiting for the transport without the opportunity to study because I might get distracted and miss it (there weren't any benches either, I had to stand still). About five minutes before the bus arrived, a pregnant woman and her friend left their house (which means they didn't had to wait an hour in the heat like me) and took the same bus I was waiting for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis bus was particularly full of people (and I mean full, there were persons standing) but for some reason two seats were available (I think it was because the sun shined at full force directly on them, but I didn't care)  so I took one of them, put on my headphones without music to drown some sound and started studying. The pregnant woman also took seat besides me, chatting with her friend who was standing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout five minutes in the route, the friend complained about her feet, so the pregnant one offered her the seat, which she happily accepted. Then it happened. The pregnant woman started complaining too. And instead of giving back the seat to her pregnant friend, the other woman asked me if I would give up my seat for her. I had my headphones so I pretended I didn't hear anything. After asking me two more times, the friend pulled out one headphone off my ear and, with a less-than-friendly tone, asked me again. I, of course, refused, arguing that the one who should give up the seat was her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe went nuts and harassed me for the entire ride. Called me names, put her hand on my notebook so I couldn't see anything and refused to give my headphone back unless I gave up my seat, while the pregnant woman only stared at me with the deadliest glare ever. I also heard the passengers talking about me, though some of them saw what happened and defended me. Still, that was one hell of a ride and I can't stop thinking about if I did the correct thing. So, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is the asshole (AITA) for refusing to give up their seat to a pregnant woman on a crowded bus.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author was waiting an hour for a bus in the heat, needing to study for an important test. They found two seats available, which they took to study. A pregnant woman and her friend arrived later, took seats. The friend offered her seat to the pregnant woman, then later asked the author for the seat. The author refused, leading to harassment from the friend.\n\nNow, the key points here: The bus was full, but there were two seats. The author took one to study. The pregnant woman had a seat next to them. The friend, after giving the seat to the pregnant woman, then asked the author for a seat. The author didn't give it up, leading to conflict.\n\nIn many places, there are laws or social norms that prioritize certain groups for seating on public transport, like pregnant women, elderly, disabled, etc. However, if the author already had a seat, and the pregnant woman was seated, perhaps the friend shouldn't have taken the seat from the author. But the friend took the seat from the pregnant woman first, then asked the author. So the author might not be at fault here since they had a seat when the pregnant woman did.\n\nAlso, the author was using the seat to prepare for a test, which is a valid reason. The other party escalated the situation, using a hostile tone and harassing the author. The author's refusal seems justified because there's no obligation to give up a seat if you're already seated, especially when the person you're being asked to move for isn't the one currently without a seat. The pregnant woman was seated, so maybe she didn't need the seat as badly. The friend's actions seem more inconsiderate here.\n\nHowever, some might argue that pregnant women should always get seats, regardless of current seating. But in this case, the author had already taken a seat, and the pregnant woman had one as well. The friend's actions might be the real issue here. The author's refusal to give up their seat when they were already using it for a valid purpose (studying for a test) seems reasonable. Plus, the harassment from the other friend makes the author's situation more understandable. So the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
