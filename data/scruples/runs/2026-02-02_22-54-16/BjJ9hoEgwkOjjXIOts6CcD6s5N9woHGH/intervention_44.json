Today I had a very important test and I wanted to be sure to arrive early and study some more at school so I went out to take the bus one and a half hour before the test. Unfortunately it seems that this morning was particularly busy because it took ONE HOUR for the bus to pass. So there I was, waiting for the transport without the opportunity to study because I might get distracted and miss it (there weren't any benches either, I had to stand still). About five minutes before the bus arrived, a pregnant woman and her friend left their house (which means they didn't had to wait an hour in the heat like me) and took the same bus I was waiting for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis bus was particularly full of people (and I mean full, there were persons standing) but for some reason two seats were available (I think it was because the sun shined at full force directly on them, but I didn't care)  so I took one of them, put on my headphones without music to drown some sound and started studying. The pregnant woman also took seat besides me, chatting with her friend who was standing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout five minutes in the route, the friend complained about her feet, so the pregnant one offered her the seat, which she happily accepted. Then it happened. The pregnant woman started complaining too. And instead of giving back the seat to her pregnant friend, the other woman asked me if I would give up my seat for her. I had my headphones so I pretended I didn't hear anything. After asking me two more times, the friend pulled out one headphone off my ear and, with a less-than-friendly tone, asked me again. I, of course, refused, arguing that the one who should give up the seat was her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe went nuts and harassed me for the entire ride. Called me names, put her hand on my notebook so I couldn't see anything and refused to give my headphone back unless I gave up my seat, while the pregnant woman only stared at me with the deadliest glare ever. I also heard the passengers talking about me, though some of them saw what happened and defended me. Still, that was one hell of a ride and I can't stop thinking about if I did the correct thing. So, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author did the right thing here. So, the situation is about a bus ride where the author took a seat, and a pregnant woman and her friend got on later. The friend ended up sitting in the seat the pregnant woman offered, and then the pregnant woman asked the author to give up their seat. The author refused and there was some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was waiting for an hour in the heat, planning to study for an important test. They took a seat that was available, even though it might have been because of the sun. The pregnant woman didn't have to wait as long, and then her friend took her seat. The author was studying with headphones on and didn't want to be disturbed. When asked to give up the seat, they refused because the other woman had the seat first. The other woman then harassed them.\n\nNow, laws and etiquette about giving up seats for pregnant women can vary. In some places, there are laws or policies that prioritize seating for pregnant women, especially if they're visibly pregnant. But the author might argue that the other woman already had the seat. However, the pregnant woman might be in more need due to her condition. \n\nThe author's reasoning was that the person who should give up the seat is the one who took the pregnant woman's seat, not them. That makes sense because the other woman had the seat first. But the conflict arises because the pregnant woman asked the author directly. The author's refusal could be seen as not being courteous, even if the other woman was at fault. However, the other woman's behavior was aggressive, including taking the headphone and harassing the author. \n\nSo, was the author in the wrong? On one hand, maybe they should have given up the seat for the pregnant woman out of politeness, even if someone else was at fault. On the other hand, the author was using a seat that was available, and the other woman had the seat first. The harassment from the other woman complicates things. If the author had given up their seat, maybe that would have been kinder, but they were also being harassed. \n\nI think the key points are: the author had a valid reason to be in a seat (studying for a test after waiting a long time), the other woman had the seat first, and the harassment was unwarranted. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe in some places, pregnant women are entitled to a seat regardless. If that's the case, the author might be seen as inconsiderate. But given that the other woman had the seat, and the author was being harassed, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. They were in a seat when it was available, and the other woman's actions were the main issue. The author's refusal was based on the fact that someone else was in the seat, not ignoring the pregnant woman's needs. Also, the harassment makes the situation more about the other woman's behavior than the author's.\n"
