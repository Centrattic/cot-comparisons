Today I had a very important test and I wanted to be sure to arrive early and study some more at school so I went out to take the bus one and a half hour before the test. Unfortunately it seems that this morning was particularly busy because it took ONE HOUR for the bus to pass. So there I was, waiting for the transport without the opportunity to study because I might get distracted and miss it (there weren't any benches either, I had to stand still). About five minutes before the bus arrived, a pregnant woman and her friend left their house (which means they didn't had to wait an hour in the heat like me) and took the same bus I was waiting for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis bus was particularly full of people (and I mean full, there were persons standing) but for some reason two seats were available (I think it was because the sun shined at full force directly on them, but I didn't care)  so I took one of them, put on my headphones without music to drown some sound and started studying. The pregnant woman also took seat besides me, chatting with her friend who was standing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout five minutes in the route, the friend complained about her feet, so the pregnant one offered her the seat, which she happily accepted. Then it happened. The pregnant woman started complaining too. And instead of giving back the seat to her pregnant friend, the other woman asked me if I would give up my seat for her. I had my headphones so I pretended I didn't hear anything. After asking me two more times, the friend pulled out one headphone off my ear and, with a less-than-friendly tone, asked me again. I, of course, refused, arguing that the one who should give up the seat was her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe went nuts and harassed me for the entire ride. Called me names, put her hand on my notebook so I couldn't see anything and refused to give my headphone back unless I gave up my seat, while the pregnant woman only stared at me with the deadliest glare ever. I also heard the passengers talking about me, though some of them saw what happened and defended me. Still, that was one hell of a ride and I can't stop thinking about if I did the correct thing. So, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to give up their seat to a pregnant woman on a crowded bus.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was waiting for an hour and a half in the heat for a bus that's taking a long time. The bus was full, but there were two seats available, probably because of the sun shining directly on them. The author took one seat and started studying. Then a pregnant woman and her friend joined, the friend took the other seat. The pregnant woman offered her seat to her friend when her friend's feet hurt. The friend then asked the author for the seat. The author refused, leading to harassment.\n\nThe key points here are the context of waiting a long time, the bus being full, the availability of two seats, and the pregnant woman giving her seat to her friend. The author's priority was to study for an important test. The other woman took the seat from the pregnant woman and then asked the author for it. The author's refusal led to conflict.\n\nI should consider cultural norms regarding giving up seats to pregnant women. In many places, it's expected, but there are exceptions. The author waited much longer, was in a position where they needed to study, and the other woman already took a seat from the pregnant woman. The pregnant woman didn't ask for the seat back, so maybe the friend's claim isn't as valid. The author's refusal in this case might be justified because the pregnant woman isn't the one requesting the seat. Also, the bus was full, so maybe the other woman shouldn't have taken the seat in the first place. The author's actions were self-preservation for an important event. The other woman's behavior was aggressive and maybe unreasonable. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here.\n"
