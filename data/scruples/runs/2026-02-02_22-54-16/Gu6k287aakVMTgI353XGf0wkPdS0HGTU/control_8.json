I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids. The author is a woman in her mid-20s, been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's known since 16 she doesn't want kids. She's been upfront with her dates about it, and this boyfriend is older. He's been making snide comments about having kids, and she's shut down the conversation each time. She even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she argues they can't afford kids and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author is being honest about her stance on kids from the start. That's usually a good thing because it's about compatibility in a relationship. But her boyfriend is older and maybe expecting kids. She's clear, so maybe he should have known from the start. But he's been making snippy comments, which might indicate he's not respecting her boundaries. She's firm in her decision, which is her right. However, saying he should leave if he wants kids could be seen as harsh, but maybe it's justified if she's not willing to compromise. Financial reasons are valid too. The boyfriend's mom's opinion might not be relevant here. The key points are honesty, mutual respect, and whether she's being unreasonable. Since she's been upfront and the boyfriend is bringing up the issue repeatedly despite her clear stance, she's not in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
