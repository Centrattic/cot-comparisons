I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting kids and shutting down conversations about it in a long-term relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is in her mid-20s, has known since 16 she didn't want kids, and has been upfront with her partners about that. She's been with her current boyfriend for over five years, and he's older. He's making snippy comments about having kids, and when the topic comes up, she shuts it down. She even told him to leave if he wants kids. His mom thinks the author doesn't love him, but she insists she does. They can't afford kids, and she wants dogs instead.\n\nSo the main question is: is she in the wrong for being firm about not having kids and possibly causing conflict? \n\nI need to consider the context. The author has been clear from the start, which is important in relationships. Not wanting kids is a personal choice, and it's reasonable as long as it's communicated. However, the boyfriend is unhappy with this stance, and the author's response (telling him to leave) might be seen as extreme. But she's standing by her decision, which is her right.\n\nFinancial reasons and personal priorities (like wanting dogs) are valid factors. The boyfriend's family's opinion (mom thinking she doesn't love him) adds pressure, but the author's feelings are genuine. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person acted in bad faith or was disrespectful. Here, the author is being upfront and honest, even if her response (telling him to leave) is a bit harsh. However, given her consistency and the fact that she's communicated her stance from the beginning, she's likely in the right. The boyfriend's expectations might not align with hers, but that's a matter of compatibility. So the answer is probably B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
