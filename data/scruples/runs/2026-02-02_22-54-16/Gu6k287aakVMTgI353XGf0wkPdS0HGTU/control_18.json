I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting kids and how that's affecting their relationship.\n\nFirst, the author is a woman in her mid-20s who has known since 16 that she doesn't want children. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years and has always made it clear that she doesn't want kids. Her partner is older, and he's been bringing up the topic, but she shuts down the conversation each time. She even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. The boyfriend's mom thinks the author doesn't love him, but she does, just doesn't want the responsibility of children. They also can't afford kids as they can't even manage their apartment.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are:\n\n1. The author has been open about her stance on not wanting kids from the start of the relationship. That's important because it's a major life decision. If she hid it, that would be different, but she's upfront. \n\n2. Her reasons are valid\u2014financial instability, workload, and personal preference. Having kids is a huge commitment, and it's reasonable for her to not want that. \n\n3. The boyfriend's mother is involved, which might be causing tension. But the mother's opinion isn't the main issue here; it's about the couple's compatibility. \n\n4. The boyfriend is older, which sometimes leads to different expectations about starting a family. However, if the author made her position clear early on, the boyfriend should have considered that before getting into a long-term relationship. \n\n5. The author is firm in her decision and isn't wavering, which might be causing conflict. But if both parties knew each other's views from the beginning, the boyfriend might not have entered the relationship with the expectation of having kids. \n\nIn most cases, honesty in relationships is key. The author didn't hide her feelings. The boyfriend might not have aligned his expectations with hers, but that's on him. The author isn't in the wrong for being honest and sticking to her decision. The real issue is whether the boyfriend is accepting of her stance or if he's leading her on despite knowing her position. Since the author has consistently communicated her stance, she's not in the wrong. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
