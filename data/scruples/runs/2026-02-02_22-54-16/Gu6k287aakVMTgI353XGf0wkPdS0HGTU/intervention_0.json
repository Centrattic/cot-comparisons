I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she's been with her boyfriend for over five years, and she's made it clear from a young age that she doesn't want kids. She's been upfront with him about this, even when he's brought up the topic. The boyfriend is older, and his mom is getting involved, suggesting that the author doesn't love him because she's against having kids. The author argues that they can't afford kids and that she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has been consistent in her stance on not wanting children since she was 16. She's made sure previous partners knew this, so she's not stringing people along. That shows she's been honest from the start. In a long-term relationship of over five years, it's reasonable to expect that major life decisions like having kids would be discussed. However, the boyfriend is bringing it up, and she's shutting it down each time. She even told him that if he wants kids, he should leave. That seems pretty firm.\n\nNow, the boyfriend's perspective isn't fully explained here. We don't know if he initially agreed to no kids or if this is a point of contention that's come up later. If he knew from the start that she didn't want kids and agreed, then his current push for children might be the issue. But if he thought there was a possibility of changing her mind, that's another angle. However, the author has been clear and consistent, so expecting her to entertain the idea later might be unreasonable.\n\nThe financial aspect is another point. They can't afford a small apartment, which complicates having kids financially. That's a valid concern. Also, she mentions wanting dogs instead, which is a different kind of responsibility but not necessarily conflicting with not having kids. \n\nThe boyfriend's mom's opinion is brought in, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong. Family opinions can be biased, especially if they're not in the same relationship. \n\nEthically, people have the right to make decisions about their bodies and future. Forcing someone to have children against their will is a violation of their autonomy. The author is clear about her stance, so she's not wrong for maintaining her position. The boyfriend might be in the wrong for not respecting her wishes, but the question is about the author's wrongness. \n\nConsidering all this, the author has been honest, consistent, and has valid reasons (financial, personal preferences). Her firmness in her decision doesn't make her wrong. The boyfriend might need to accept that or consider if the relationship can continue without children. So the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
