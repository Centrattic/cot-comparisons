I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not entertaining the idea of having kids, given her situation.\n\nFirst, the author is in her mid-20s, female. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's known since 16 that she doesn't want kids. She thinks kids are expensive, dirty, a lot of work, not worth it. She's been upfront with her partners about not wanting kids, so she's not stringing people along. Now, her boyfriend is older and has been making snippy comments about having kids. She shuts down the conversation each time and once told him if he wants kids, he should leave. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she does. They can't afford kids, and she wants dogs instead.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Let's break it down. The key points here are her upfront communication, her reasons (financial, personal preferences), and the fact that she's been consistent. She's not hiding her stance. Her boyfriend's family (his mom) is involved, which adds some pressure. But the core issue is whether not wanting kids is a valid reason to be in the wrong.\n\nIn many societies, people have different views on having children. It's a personal choice. If she's been honest from the start, and her partner knew this, then she's not being deceptive. However, maybe the boyfriend expected her to reconsider? But the author's stance is firm and long-standing. Also, financial reasons are practical. They can't even afford their apartment, so kids would be a stretch. She wants dogs, which are less responsibility. \n\nBut the boyfriend's mom's disapproval might indicate some external pressure, but that's not the author's fault. The main question is about the author's decision. If she's communicated her position clearly and the boyfriend accepted her, then he should respect that. If he's pressuring her now, maybe the issue is on his side. The author isn't forcing him to stay; she's saying if he wants kids, he should leave. So she's not in the wrong for standing by her decision, especially since she's been upfront. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say that she's being selfish or not considering her partner's wishes. But if he knew her position from the start, he's the one who chose to stay. It's his choice to stay despite her stance. So the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, answer B.\n"
