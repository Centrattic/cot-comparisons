I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a woman in her mid-20s in a five-year relationship with her older boyfriend. She's clear from a young age that she doesn't want kids and has communicated this to her partners. Her boyfriend has been making snippy comments about having kids, and when confronted, she told him that if he wants kids, he should leave because she's not going to do that. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she insists she does. They can't afford kids financially, and she prefers having dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points here are communication, mutual respect, and the right to make personal decisions. The author has been upfront about her stance on having kids since she was 16 and made sure her partners knew. That's important because it shows she's not keeping this a secret. Now, in a five-year relationship, the boyfriend is bringing up the topic with snippy comments, which might indicate he's not respecting her boundaries or that he's becoming more insistent over time. The author is firm in her decision, which she's had for a long time, and she's communicated it clearly. However, telling him to leave if he wants kids could be seen as a strong stance, but given her consistency, it's also about maintaining her own values and boundaries.\n\nFinancial aspects are mentioned; they can't afford kids, which is a practical concern. Her preference for dogs over children is personal and doesn't affect the main issue. The boyfriend's mom's opinion is part of the external pressure but not the core of the author's responsibility.\n\nIn relationships, both parties need to have compatible views on major life decisions like having children. If the author made her stance clear from the start and the boyfriend continued the relationship knowing this, then the responsibility isn't fully on her. However, if the boyfriend's comments indicate that he's not accepting her decision and is pressuring her, that's on him. The author is standing by her own values and circumstances, so she's not in the wrong. The key is whether she communicated effectively and if the boyfriend respected her decision. Since she did communicate and he's now showing dissatisfaction, the fault isn't hers.\n"
