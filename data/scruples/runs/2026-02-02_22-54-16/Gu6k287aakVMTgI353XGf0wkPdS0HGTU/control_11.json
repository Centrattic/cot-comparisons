I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids and shutting down conversations about it. The author is a woman in her mid-20s in a 5-year relationship. She's been clear about not wanting kids since she was 16, and she's only dated people who don't want kids too. Her boyfriend is older, and he's been making comments about wanting kids. She's firm in her stance, even telling him to leave if that's what he wants. The boyfriend's mom thinks the author doesn't love him, but she does.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has been upfront about her feelings on children from the start, which is good. She's made sure previous partners didn't want kids either. The current boyfriend has been in the relationship for over five years but is now bringing up the topic, and she's closing the conversation. The author's reasons are valid: financial instability, the work involved, and personal preference for dogs. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. In relationships, both partners need to align on major life decisions like having children. If one partner is resolute against it, and the other is conflicted or wants it, there's a potential for conflict. The author's approach might be seen as not being open to discussion, but she's been clear from the beginning. However, since the relationship has lasted five years, maybe there's an expectation of considering compromise. But the author hasn't wavered and has communicated her stance. Her boyfriend might need to accept her position or realize it's a deal-breaker. The mother's opinion is her own and shouldn't dictate the couple's decisions. \n\nLooking at it from a fairness standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong if she's been honest and the issue was discussed early on. The boyfriend might need to evaluate if he can accept her no-kids stance. The author isn't obligated to change her mind, especially with valid reasons. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
