I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting kids and the boyfriend wanting them after five years.\n\nFirst, the author made it clear from 16 that she didn't want kids. She's been upfront with partners about this, which is good. She's been with her boyfriend over five years, and he's been bringing up kids, leading to tension. She's firm in her stance, even telling him to leave if he wants kids. They can't afford kids, and she wants dogs instead.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, she communicated her feelings early on. That's important because having kids is a big decision. He might be frustrated, but if he didn't consider this a deal-breaker before committing, maybe he's at fault. The mom's judgment is her problem. The author isn't forcing the relationship; she's honest. Financial issues are a real barrier. So the answer is probably B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
