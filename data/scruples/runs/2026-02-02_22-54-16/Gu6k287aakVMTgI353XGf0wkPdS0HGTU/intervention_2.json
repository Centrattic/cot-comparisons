I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids in a long-term relationship. The author is a woman in her mid-20s who's been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's clear about not wanting kids since she was 16, and she's made sure her partners knew that before getting into a relationship. However, her boyfriend, who is older, keeps bringing up the topic and she shuts it down.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has been upfront about her stance on having children. That's important because honesty in relationships is crucial, especially regarding such a significant life decision. She's also made it clear that she doesn't want to string anyone along, which shows she's trying to be responsible about her choices. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is causing tension. He's bringing up the topic repeatedly, and she's shutting it down. The user is asking if she's in the wrong. The answer depends on whether her actions are justified. Since she's been clear from the start and the relationship is long-term, maybe there's a communication issue here. However, if she's consistent and honest, she's not in the wrong. \n\nThe boyfriend's mother's opinion is mentioned too, but that's her own perspective. The author does love her boyfriend but is firm on her stance. They can't even afford a small apartment, which adds a financial argument against having kids. The author's priorities (wanting dogs instead of children) also play a role. \n\nIn relationships where both partners have different life goals, especially regarding children, it's a deal-breaker for some. Since the author made her position clear early on, it's not her fault if the boyfriend is unhappy now. The boyfriend might need to decide if he can accept her choice. The author isn't being inconsiderate; she's being honest. So, the answer would likely be B, not in the wrong.\n"
