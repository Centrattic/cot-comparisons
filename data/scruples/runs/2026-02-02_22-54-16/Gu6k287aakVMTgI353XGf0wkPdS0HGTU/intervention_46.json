I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting kids and her boyfriend being upset about it. The author has been clear from a young age that she doesn't want kids, and she's made sure her partners know that. Now, with her boyfriend of over five years, he's bringing up the topic, and she's shutting it down, even telling him to leave if he wants kids. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she insists she does. They can't afford kids, and she wants a dog instead.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A for yes and B for no. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong and wants confirmation.\n\nThe author has been consistent about her stance on kids since 16. That's a long time, so she's not making a last-minute decision. She's communicated this to partners before to avoid leading anyone on. Now, with her current boyfriend, she's been in a long-term relationship. He's bringing up the topic, and she's clearly stating her position. She's even told him directly that if he wants kids, he should leave. That's pretty firm, but maybe a bit harsh? However, she's standing by her values and being honest.\n\nThe boyfriend's mother is involved, which adds pressure. The author's reasoning includes financial reasons and her personal preferences (dogs over kids). These are valid arguments. People have different priorities, and not wanting kids is a personal choice. The author isn't trying to force kids on anyone; she's being upfront.\n\nIs there any fault here? The author isn't being deceptive. She's made her stance clear. The boyfriend might need to accept that if he wants kids, this relationship isn't the right fit. The author isn't in the wrong for being honest about her non-negotiables. The boyfriend's mom's opinion might be judgmental, but that's their family dynamic.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
