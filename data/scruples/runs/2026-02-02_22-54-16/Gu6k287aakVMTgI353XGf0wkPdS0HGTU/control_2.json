I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids and shutting down conversations about it with her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The woman is in her mid-20s, has known since 16 she doesn't want kids. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years, and he's older. He's been making snippy comments about having kids, which she shuts down. She even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she insists she does. They can't afford kids, and she prefers dogs.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. Having kids is a major life decision. People have different reasons for wanting or not wanting them. The author has been clear from the start that she doesn't want kids, which is important because it's a deal-breaker for some. She's been upfront with her partners, which is responsible. \n\nIn her current relationship, she's been with her boyfriend for five years. He's starting to bring up the topic, maybe because he's older or they're in their 50s? Wait, the boyfriend is older than her, but she's mid-20s. Maybe he's in his 30s? The key is that he's making comments, which she's shutting down. She's firm in her stance, which is her right. \n\nShe mentions financial reasons: they can't afford kids. That's a valid point. Raising children is expensive, and if they can't even afford their current apartment, it's not realistic. Also, she wants dogs instead of kids. That's a personal choice. \n\nThe boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him because of this. But the author says she does love him. That's their relationship dynamic. The mother's opinion might not be the most important factor here. \n\nIs she wrong for not entertaining the idea? Well, she's been consistent. She's not stringing him along; she's been clear. If he can't accept her stance, maybe their values are incompatible. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nIn some views, being open-minded is important, but if someone has a firm stance, they have the right to be upfront. It's not her responsibility to change her stance to meet his desires. \n\nFinancial stability is a real concern. She's practical in her approach. Choosing not to have kids isn't selfish if it's because of personal choice and realistic circumstances. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's made her position clear, considered practical factors, and is being honest. The boyfriend might need to accept her decision or realize it's not compatible. So the answer is B.\n"
