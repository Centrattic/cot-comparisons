I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being in a long-term relationship and not wanting kids, while her boyfriend is getting snippy about the possibility. The author has been upfront from the start about not wanting kids and has been clear with her boyfriend. Now, the boyfriend is pressuring her, and she told him to leave if that's what he wants. Her reasoning includes financial instability and personal preferences, like wanting dogs instead of kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author made her stance clear early on, so there's no deception. She's being honest about her desires, which is important in relationships. The boyfriend, on the other hand, might be struggling with his own expectations or societal pressures. But does that make the author wrong? Probably not, because she's not forcing him into anything. She's given him the information, and he should have respected that if he agreed to be in the relationship. \n\nHowever, there's a five-year relationship here. Maybe he thought they could come to a compromise or that her views might change. But the author has been consistent for years, so the boyfriend might need to reevaluate if having kids is a non-negotiable for him. The fact that the author is upfront and standing her ground suggests she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's comments and his mom's disapproval don't negate the author's right to her own choices. \n\nFinancial reasons are also a valid concern. Raising kids is expensive, and if they can't afford a small apartment, adding a child would be a significant burden. The author's preference for dogs over a lifelong commitment like kids is a personal choice. The key points here are honesty, mutual respect, and whether either party is being unreasonable. The author hasn't been deceptive, and she's made her position clear. The boyfriend might be the one who's invested in an incompatible future, which would make him the asshole in this scenario. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
