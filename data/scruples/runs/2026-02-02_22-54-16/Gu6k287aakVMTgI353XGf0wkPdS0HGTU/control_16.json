I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman in her mid-20s who has never wanted kids and has been upfront with her boyfriend about it. They've been together over five years, and he's making snippy comments about having kids. She's firm in her stance, even telling him to leave if he wants kids. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she does. They can't afford kids, and she prefers dogs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has been clear from the start about not wanting kids, which is a major life decision. In long-term relationships, compatibility on having kids is crucial. She's made sure her partners know her stance, so she's not being deceptive. Her boyfriend, after five years, is still bringing it up, which might indicate he hasn't accepted her position. The argument here is whether it's her fault for not entertaining the idea, or if he should have considered her stance from the beginning.\n\nFinancial stability is another factor. They can't even afford a small apartment, so having kids would be impractical. She also mentions wanting dogs instead, which is a personal choice. The boyfriend's mom's opinion is part of the social pressure, but the author's feelings are clear\u2014she does love him but can't compromise on this.\n\nNow, societal views vary, but generally, if someone is upfront about their stance on kids early in a relationship, it's the other person's responsibility to consider that before committing long-term. The author isn't forcing him into a situation; she's been clear. The boyfriend's continued push for kids after five years suggests he either didn't take her position seriously or hasn't aligned his expectations. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong for maintaining her decision. The answer should be B (No), as she's being honest and practical, and the conflict stems from the boyfriend not respecting her boundaries over time.\n"
