I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is in her mid-20s, has known she doesn't want kids since 16, and has been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's shutting down conversations about having kids, and even told him he should leave if he wants them. Her boyfriend and his mom are upset, thinking she doesn't love him, but she argues they can't afford kids and wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has been clear about her stance on not wanting kids. She's been upfront with her partners, which shows she's honest. She's been in a long-term relationship, which means she's had time to discuss this. The boyfriend's family is involved, which might add pressure. The author mentions financial reasons and personal choice, which are valid reasons for not wanting children. She's also willing to let the relationship go if the issue is a deal-breaker for her partner. \n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, having kids is a major decision. If both partners can't agree, it's a significant issue. The author isn't forcing the situation; she's being upfront. The boyfriend might feel his desires aren't respected, but the author is also standing by her own values. There's no indication she's being manipulative or dishonest. She's communicated her position clearly. \n\nPossible counterarguments: The boyfriend might feel neglected or that his wants aren't considered. But the author isn't hiding her stance. They should have addressed this earlier if it's a deal-breaker. Since she's been clear, it's up to both to decide if they can accept each other's positions. \n\nAlso, financial stability is a valid concern. The author can't afford kids, which is a real-life factor. Wanting dogs instead is a personal choice. \n\nSo, in my view, the author isn't in the wrong. She's honest, communicated her feelings, and is standing by her decisions. The conflict arises from differing values, which is common in relationships. The responsibility here isn't on one side more than the other. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
