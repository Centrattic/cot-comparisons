I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong.\n\nSo the author is a woman in her mid-20s who has been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's known since 16 that she doesn't want kids, and she's made sure all her partners knew that. Her boyfriend, who is older, has been making snippy comments about having kids, and she shuts those conversations down. She even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but the author claims she does. They can't afford kids, and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has been clear about her stance on not wanting children from the start. That's important because being upfront in a relationship about such a big life decision is usually considered responsible. She's been with this boyfriend for five years, which suggests they've had time to discuss this. However, he's bringing up the topic repeatedly, and she's firm in her position. \n\nThe boyfriend's mother is involved, which can complicate things. Family opinions might pressure the boyfriend, but the author's stance should be respected as long as it's communicated clearly. The financial aspect is also a valid concern\u2014kids are expensive, and they can't even afford their apartment. She also mentions wanting dogs instead, which is a personal preference.\n\nNow, the main question is whether she's in the wrong. If she's been honest and consistent, and the boyfriend hasn't been able to accept that, then the issue might lie with the boyfriend. But maybe the boyfriend feels neglected or unfulfilled because his desire for kids isn't met. However, the author isn't the one changing her stance here. She's sticking to her original position, which she communicated early on.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's more about mutual respect and understanding. If both people in a relationship can't agree on having kids, it's a deal-breaker for many. The author is making a choice that aligns with her values and circumstances. The boyfriend might need to decide if he can accept her position or if he needs a partner who wants kids. The author isn't wrong for being clear and firm in her decision, especially since she's made that clear from the start. The boyfriend's frustration is his issue to handle, not hers.\n"
