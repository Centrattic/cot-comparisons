I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting to have kids. The author is a woman in her mid-20s, been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's known since 16 she didn't want kids, and she's been upfront with her partners. Her boyfriend is older, and he's been making snippy comments about having kids. She shuts down the conversation and once told him if he wants kids, he should leave. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she does. They can't afford kids, and she wants dogs instead.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break this down. First, the author has been clear about her stance on kids since she was 16. That's pretty early, so she's had a long time to consider this. She's also upfront with her partners, which is good communication. The boyfriend is older, but she's been with him for over five years. Over that time, he's made snippy comments about wanting kids, but she's shut those conversations down. When he brought it up, she told him if he wants kids, he should leave. That seems pretty firm.\n\nThe boyfriend's mom is involved here, thinking the author doesn't love him. But the author states she does love him. The key points here are communication and mutual expectations. The author has made her stance clear from the start, and the boyfriend hasn't respected that by continuing to bring up the topic. The author's reasoning includes financial instability, the workload of kids, and personal preference for dogs. These are valid reasons.\n\nFrom my perspective, the author is not in the wrong because she communicated her position early and consistently. The boyfriend, on the other hand, might be in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries and continuing to push for something she's made clear she won't do. Relationships require compromise, but if one person's core values are non-negotiable, it's reasonable for them to set that boundary. The author hasn't strung him along; she's been clear. The boyfriend's mom's opinion doesn't change the fact that the author's decision is her right.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
