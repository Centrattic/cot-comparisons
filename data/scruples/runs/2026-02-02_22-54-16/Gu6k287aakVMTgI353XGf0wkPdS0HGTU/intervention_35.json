I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids and shutting down conversations about it in her long-term relationship. First, I need to look at the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is in her mid-20s, female, has been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's known since 16 that she doesn't want kids. She's been upfront with partners about this, ensuring they don't want kids either. Now, her boyfriend, who's older, is making snippy comments about having kids. She shuts down the conversation and even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she insists she does. They can't afford kids, and she prefers dogs.\n\nSo, the key points here are: she's been clear about her stance for years, she's been honest with partners, her current relationship has known this for a long time. She's standing her ground despite the boyfriend's comments. The boyfriend's mom is involved, which might be causing pressure.\n\nNow, considering societal norms, some people might think that in a long-term relationship, the desire for kids is important, but others would say it's a personal choice. The author isn't making the boyfriend promise not to have kids in the future; she's stating her own stance. She's also being honest from the start, which is usually advised in relationships to avoid future issues. The financial aspect is a valid concern, and she's upfront about that too. Her firmness in saying if he wants kids, he should leave is a strong position, which some might see as harsh, but given her consistency, maybe justified.\n\nThe boyfriend's comments are recurring, so maybe he hasn't accepted her stance. However, the author hasn't changed her position, which she's had since high school. It's been over five years together, so maybe the boyfriend should have considered this before entering a long-term relationship. The mother's opinion isn't the author's responsibility; she's not the one making the comments. The author's priority is her own happiness and values.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about mutual respect. The author is respecting her own desires and communicating them, while the boyfriend might be struggling with unmet expectations. Since the author has been transparent and the relationship has lasted this long, it's more about whether they can reconcile their differing values. The author isn't wrong in asserting her boundaries, especially if she's been consistent and honest. The boyfriend might need to accept her stance or realize it's not compatible. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
