I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids in a long-term relationship. The author has known since 16 that she doesn't want children and has been upfront with her boyfriend about it. They've been together over five years, and he's older. She shuts down conversations about kids and even told him he should leave if that's what he wants. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but the author insists she does.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has been clear about her stance from the start. She's been with her boyfriend for more than five years, which is a significant amount of time. The boyfriend is making comments about wanting kids, and she's firm in her position. Financial issues are a factor, and she mentions they can't afford kids. Also, she wants dogs instead of kids.\n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, the main factors are communication and mutual respect. The author has communicated her stance clearly and early on. The boyfriend, being older, might have different expectations, but if he's not willing to accept her decision, there might be a problem there. The author isn't forcing him to stay; she's saying if that's a deal-breaker, he should leave. That seems like a clear boundary.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend's mom's opinion is mentioned, but that's external. The key is whether the author is respecting her partner's wishes. But if the author is clear about her stance and the partner can't accept that, maybe the issue is on the partner's side. The author isn't pressuring him to have kids; she's stating her position. The financial aspect is a valid concern too.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't acting in bad faith. She's honest about her feelings. The boyfriend's persistence might indicate that he hasn't accepted her stance yet, but the author isn't in the wrong for being clear. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
