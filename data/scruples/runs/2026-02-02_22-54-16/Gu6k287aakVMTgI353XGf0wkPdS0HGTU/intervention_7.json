I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person is in their mid-20s, female, and has known since 16 that they don't want kids. They mention kids are expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and not worth it. When dating, they make sure their partners also don't want kids to avoid leading anyone on. However, her boyfriend, who she's been with over five years, is older, and he's been making snippy comments about having kids. She shuts down those conversations, and once told him if he wants kids, he should leave. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she does. They can't afford kids because they work full-time and struggle with their apartment. She wants dogs instead of a lifetime responsibility.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she's not, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. She's been clear about her stance on kids from the start. She's been with her boyfriend over five years, which is a long time. She's direct when he brings up the topic, which he does with snippy comments. He might be unhappy, but she's firm. Financial constraints and her personal choice for pets over kids are factors. His mom's opinion might add pressure, but that's not her issue directly.\n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to align on major life decisions like having children. If both agree early on, it's better. She's made her position clear, and if he can't accept that after five years, maybe the issue is on his side for not finding someone with matching views. However, if he's consistently bringing it up and she's shutting it down, maybe there's a communication issue. But given her stance and the time they've been together, it seems she's not the one in the wrong. The boyfriend might need to accept her position or realize it's incompatible. The author is being honest and isn't leading him on. So the answer is B.\n"
