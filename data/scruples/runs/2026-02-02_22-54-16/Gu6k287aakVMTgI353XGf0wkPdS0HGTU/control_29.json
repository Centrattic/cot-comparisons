I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman in her mid-20s in a five-year relationship who has always known she doesn't want kids. She's made this clear to her boyfriend, but he's been bringing up the topic and getting snippy comments. She's firm, even telling him to leave if he wants kids. His mom doesn't understand, thinking she doesn't love him, but the author does love him, just not the idea of having children.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if her stance is valid. The key points here are consent and communication. The author has been upfront from the start about not wanting kids. She makes sure her partners don't want kids either, which shows she's being responsible and honest. In a long-term relationship, mutual understanding of each other's deal-breakers is crucial. If the boyfriend hasn't raised this issue until after five years and is now pressuring her, maybe he didn't communicate his needs properly or didn't consider her stance seriously.\n\nThe author's argument is that having kids is expensive, hard, and not worth it for her. She also mentions financial instability and prioritizing pets over kids. These are valid personal choices. The boyfriend, however, is pushing for it, leading to tension. The author's firm response that she won't do it and that he should leave if that's the case is a matter of respecting her boundaries. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's being honest and consistent. The problem seems to lie more on the boyfriend's side for not respecting her established boundary and perhaps not being clear about his own expectations. The mother's judgment is irrelevant because the author's feelings are clearly stated. Love doesn't necessarily mean wanting to have children. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong. She communicated her stance early and is sticking to it, which is her right. The boyfriend's pressure suggests he might not have fully considered her position before entering the relationship, which could be a red flag for him.\n"
