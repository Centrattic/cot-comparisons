I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting kids and the boyfriend's reaction. \n\nFirst, the author is in her mid-20s, has known she doesn't want kids since 16, and has been upfront with her partners about it. She's been with her current boyfriend for over 5 years, and he's older. He's making comments about having kids, and she's shutting those conversations down. She even told him if he wants kids, he should leave because she won't do it. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she does, and adds that they can't afford kids and she wants dogs instead.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author has been clear about her stance on kids from the start, which is her right. She's been honest, which is important in relationships. The boyfriend has been with her for 5 years, so he knew this before committing long-term. His comments might be an issue because he's not respecting her boundaries. The fact that his mom is involved suggests maybe he's pushing the issue, but the author is firm in her decision. \n\nFinancial reasons and wanting dogs instead are valid personal choices. The author isn't forcing him to stay; she's just being honest about her limits. So, I don't think she's in the wrong here. The boyfriend might need to accept her decision or realize it's not compatible, but that's his choice. The author is being upfront and sticking to her values. So answer B.\n"
