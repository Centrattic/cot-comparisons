I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The author is a woman in her mid-20s who has been clear from a young age that she doesn't want kids. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years and has made sure he doesn't want kids either. Now he's making snippy comments about having kids, and she's firm in her stance, even telling him to leave if that's what he wants. Her reasoning includes the high cost, the work involved, and her own financial situation. The boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she does.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she's not, but wants my opinion. Let me break it down. \n\nFirst, she's been honest from the start. When she started dating, she made sure her partners didn't want kids. That shows she's upfront, which is important in relationships. Then, with her current boyfriend, she's been clear. She's been in the relationship for over five years, so there's a history here. The boyfriend is making comments now, but maybe he's reconsidering his own stance or feels pressure. She's not budging because she's clear on her values. \n\nFinancial reasons are valid. The couple can't even afford a small apartment, so having kids would be a strain. She also mentions wanting dogs instead, which shows her preference for different responsibilities. \n\nThe boyfriend's mom's opinion is mentioned, but that's external. The key is the couple's communication. The author has been consistent and communicated her stance. The boyfriend's reaction is causing tension, but it's his choice whether he's okay with no kids. If he can't accept her decision, then the conflict is on his side. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because she's been honest and clear, and her reasons are valid. The boyfriend should have known her stance before committing to the relationship. His comments now might be him not accepting her decision, which is his issue. So the answer should be B.\n"
