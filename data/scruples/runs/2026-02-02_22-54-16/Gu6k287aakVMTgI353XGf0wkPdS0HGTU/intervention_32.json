I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The author is a woman in her mid-20s who has been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's known since 16 that she doesn't want kids and has made sure her partners share that view. Now her boyfriend, who's older, is making snippy comments about having kids, and she's shutting down the conversation. She even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she claims she does. They can't afford kids, and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has been clear about her stance on not wanting kids since she was young. She's been upfront with her partners, which is responsible. Her boyfriend is older, but she's been with him for over five years, so maybe they've discussed this before? However, the boyfriend is bringing up the topic and getting upset. The author is firm in her decision, which can be valid, but maybe the boyfriend expects her to reconsider?\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Well, people have the right to their reproductive choices. The author isn't forcing him to have kids; she's making it clear she doesn't want them. If the boyfriend can't accept that, maybe the problem is his expectations. Also, financial instability is a real issue, and wanting dogs instead is a personal preference. The mother's opinion might not be relevant here.\n\nBut maybe the author is being too dismissive? She told him to leave if he wants kids. That could be seen as extreme. However, if that's non-negotiable for her, it's her right. The boyfriend might need to accept her stance or leave. So, it's a matter of conflicting needs. The author isn't in the wrong for being clear about her wishes. The boyfriend might need to adjust or part ways. So the answer is B.\n"
