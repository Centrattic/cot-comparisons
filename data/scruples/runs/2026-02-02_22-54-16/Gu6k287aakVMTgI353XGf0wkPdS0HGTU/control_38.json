I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting kids and her boyfriend's reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author is in her mid-20s, has been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's been clear since she was 16 that she doesn't want kids. She makes sure her partners don't want kids either. Now her boyfriend, who is older, is giving her snippy comments about having kids. She shuts down the conversation each time. She even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but the author insists she does. They can't afford kids and she wants dogs instead.\n\nSo, the key points are that she's been upfront about her stance from the start of the relationship. She's made sure her partners align with her views. Now the boyfriend is pushing for kids, which she's against. The question is whether she's wrong for not entertaining the idea.\n\nIn relationships, compatibility on kids is a big deal. If both parties aren't on the same page, it can cause major issues. The author has been clear from the beginning, so she's not stringing him along. Her reasoning includes financial instability and personal preferences. The boyfriend might not have considered her stance when entering the relationship, or maybe he assumed he could change her mind. But since she's been consistent, it's not her fault he's changing his mind. His mom's disapproval is another layer, but that's his family's issue, not hers.\n\nShe's standing by her decision, and since they can't afford kids and she's made her position clear, she's not wrong. The boyfriend should respect her choice even if he's unhappy. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
