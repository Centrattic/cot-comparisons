I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a woman in her mid-20s who has never wanted kids since she was 16. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years, and he's older. She's been clear about not wanting kids, but he keeps bringing up the topic. She's even told him that if he wants kids, he should leave, and her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author has been upfront from the start about her stance on having kids. She's been with her boyfriend for more than five years, which is a significant amount of time, and she's maintained her position. Her reasons include financial instability, the workload of kids, and her own preferences for having dogs instead. She's also clear that she doesn't want to string anyone along, which shows she's considered the other person's feelings. However, her response of telling him to leave if he wants kids might be seen as harsh, but she's standing by her decision. \n\nThe boyfriend's mother's opinion is mentioned, but that's more about others' perceptions than the actual issue between the couple. The key factors here are communication and mutual respect. The author has communicated her stance clearly. It's the boyfriend who might be in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries after five years. However, if he's unhappy with the lack of kids, maybe the problem lies in their differing life goals. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not the boyfriend. \n\nThe author made her position clear from the start, which is responsible. It's possible that the boyfriend should have considered her stance earlier, but the author isn't at fault for sticking to her decision. The answer would be B, as she's not in the wrong based on her communication and consistency.\n"
