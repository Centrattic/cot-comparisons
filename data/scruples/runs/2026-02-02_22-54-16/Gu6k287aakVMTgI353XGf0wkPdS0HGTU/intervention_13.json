I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting kids and the boyfriend wanting them.\n\nFirst, the author has been clear from a young age that she doesn't want children. She's also been upfront with her partners about this. Now, with her boyfriend of over five years, he's making comments about having kids, and she shuts down the conversation each time. She even told him to leave if that's what he wants. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author has made her stance clear from the start. She's not changing her mind, which is her right. The boyfriend, on the other hand, might be struggling with his own desires, but he hasn't found a resolution. The fact that his mom is involved adds another layer, but the user is asking about the author's responsibility.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and I agree. Not wanting kids is a personal choice. The author hasn't been stringing him along; she's been honest. The boyfriend might need to come to terms with his own feelings about children. If he can't accept her choice, maybe the relationship isn't compatible, but that's his issue. The author isn't at fault for sticking to her decision.\n"
