I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given text is in the wrong. The author is a woman in her mid-20s in a 5-year relationship. She's firm about not wanting kids and has been upfront with her boyfriend from the start. However, he's been making snippy comments about having kids, and when it comes up, she shuts it down. She even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she says she does. The main points are her stance on not wanting kids, her communication, financial constraints, and her desire for dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if she's in the wrong. The key factors here are communication and mutual respect. She's been clear about her views on kids since the beginning of the relationship. That's good because it's important to be upfront about such a significant life decision. The boyfriend's persistence in bringing up the topic despite her clear stance might indicate that he hasn't respected her boundaries. However, maybe he thinks their circumstances could change, like having kids in the future even if they can't now. But the author is firm and doesn't want to consider it, which could be a deal-breaker for him.\n\nIs she wrong for not entertaining the idea? Well, people have different values. If having children is a non-negotiable for him, then they might be incompatible. She's not forcing him to be in the relationship; she's given him an ultimatum. That's a strong approach, but if he's unhappy, he's the one to decide whether to leave. Financial reasons and personal preferences (like wanting dogs) are valid. But maybe she could have discussed compromise or explored his concerns more? However, she's already been clear multiple times. \n\nThe boyfriend's mother implying she doesn't love him might be a projection from the mother, not the author. The author states she does love him, so that's her perspective. The boyfriend's mom's opinion isn't necessarily relevant here. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, relationships require compatibility. If both parties can't meet in the middle on such a critical issue, it's possible the relationship isn't sustainable. The author isn't wrong for standing by her decision, especially since she communicated it from the start. The boyfriend might be in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries and pushing the issue. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
