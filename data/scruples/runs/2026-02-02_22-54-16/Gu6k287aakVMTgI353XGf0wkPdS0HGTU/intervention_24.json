I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong regarding not wanting kids. The author is a woman in her mid-20s, been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's been clear from a young age that she doesn't want kids, and she's only dated people who also don't want kids. Now her boyfriend is giving her snippy comments about having kids, and she's shutting down the conversation. She even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she does. They can't afford kids, and she wants dogs instead of a lifetime responsibility.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has been consistent in her stance on not wanting kids since she was 16. She's only dated people who share her view, which shows she's been upfront and honest about her preferences. Her boyfriend is older, but they've been together for five years. The fact that he's giving her snippy comments suggests he might be frustrated or not respecting her boundaries. She shut down the conversation, which is her right since it's her choice. She even gave a firm boundary by telling him to leave if he wants kids, which is a clear indication of her stance.\n\nThe boyfriend's mom's opinion is mentioned, but that's her son's mother's judgment. The user's question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The main factors here are consent, communication, and respect. The author communicated her stance clearly and consistently. The boyfriend might not have accepted that, leading to conflict. Financial constraints are also a valid reason, as they can't afford kids. She prefers dogs, which are less of a lifetime commitment compared to children, showing she's thought about her priorities.\n\nIs it wrong for her to not entertain the idea of having kids? It seems like she's made her position clear and stands by her decision. The boyfriend's reaction (snippy comments, mom's judgment) doesn't negate her right to make her own choice. In relationships, mutual respect for each other's values is crucial. If the boyfriend can't accept her stance, maybe the relationship isn't compatible. But the author isn't forcing him to stay; she's given him a choice. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
