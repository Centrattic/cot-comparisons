I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing not to have kids and how that's affecting her relationship.\n\nFirst, the author is in her mid-20s, has been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's been clear from a young age that she doesn't want kids. She makes sure her partners don't want them too. Now her boyfriend is giving her snippy comments about having kids, and she shuts down the conversation, even telling him to leave if that's what he wants. Her boyfriend's mom is involved, thinking the author doesn't love him, but she does.\n\nSo the main points here: the author has been consistent in her stance on not wanting kids. She's been upfront with her partners. The boyfriend's issue is coming up now, maybe because he's older or wants kids. But they can't afford kids, both work full-time, and she prefers dogs. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, people have different values. Choosing not to have kids is a personal choice. The author is honest from the start, which is good. She's not stringing anyone along. The boyfriend might be trying to change her mind, but she's firm. The problem is if the boyfriend isn't respecting her choice. \n\nThe boyfriend\u2019s mom's opinion isn't the main issue here. The key is mutual respect in the relationship. If the author is clear and the boyfriend is pressuring her, that's his issue. She's not wrong for sticking to her decision. Unless there's a breach of trust or communication, she's not in the wrong. \n\nSo answer B, No.\n"
