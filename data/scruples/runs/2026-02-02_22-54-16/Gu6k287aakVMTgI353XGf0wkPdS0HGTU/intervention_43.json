I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids and shutting down conversations about it in her long-term relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the scenario. The author has clearly stated she doesn't want kids since she was 16. She's been upfront with her partners about this, and now with her boyfriend of over five years. She shuts down the conversation each time he brings it up and once told him to leave if he wants kids. The boyfriend is older, and his mom thinks the author doesn't love him because of this. They also can't afford kids financially and she prefers dogs.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether not wanting kids and being firm about it is wrong. From a moral standpoint, people have different values. Choosing not to have children is a personal decision and should be respected. However, in relationships, differing views on having kids can create conflict. The author is being honest from the start, which is important. She's not stringing him along, which is good. But she's also being very firm, even to the point of saying he should leave if he wants kids. That might come off as harsh, but she's standing by her decision.\n\nFinancial stability is another factor. They can't afford kids, which is a practical reason. Her prioritization of wanting dogs over a lifetime responsibility shows her priorities. The boyfriend's family (his mom) disapproving might add pressure, but the author's stance is about her own values.\n\nNow, considering if she's in the wrong. If she's communicated her stance clearly from the beginning and the relationship is still ongoing despite differing views, it's about mutual respect. However, if the boyfriend feels pressured or that his needs are not considered, that could be a point against her. But given that she's been upfront, it's hard to say she's in the wrong. People have the right to make personal reproductive choices, and she's being honest. The conflict is more about their compatibility rather than her being wrong. So, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
