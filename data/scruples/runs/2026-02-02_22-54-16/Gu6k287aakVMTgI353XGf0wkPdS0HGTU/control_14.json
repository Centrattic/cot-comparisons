I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author not wanting kids and her boyfriend wanting them. They've been together over five years. She's been clear from the start, even back when she was 16. She's made sure her partners didn't want kids before dating them. Now, her boyfriend is older, and he's bringing up kids, but she's shutting it down. She told him if he wants kids, he should leave. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she does. They can't afford kids and she prefers dogs.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points are communication, consistency, and mutual respect. She's been upfront about not wanting kids since her teens. She's dated people who also didn't want kids. Now, with her current boyfriend, she's made her stance clear. He's been getting snippy comments, but she's shutting down the conversation. She's given a firm boundary, telling him to leave if he wants kids. \n\nIs it reasonable for her to have this stance? Well, people have different values. Not wanting kids is a valid choice. She's being honest and consistent. The boyfriend might be frustrated, but if she's been clear all along, he might have known this before committing. The financial aspect is also a real issue, and wanting dogs instead is a personal preference. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's feelings are hurt. His mom's comment suggests he's feeling unloved. But the author's position is that she does love him but can't compromise on this. The question is whether her approach is wrong. If she's been transparent and he's choosing to bring it up despite that, maybe the issue is on his side. She's not forcing him to stay, but telling him to leave if that's what he wants. \n\nIn relationships, it's important for both parties to respect each other's boundaries. Since she's been clear and consistent, she's not being deceitful. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
