I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids. The situation is that the author has been clear from a young age about not wanting children, made sure partners knew before dating, and now in a 5-year relationship where the boyfriend is getting pushy about kids. The author shut down the conversation and told him to leave if that's what he wants. The boyfriend's mom is judging her, and they can't afford kids anyway.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about personal choice and communication. The author has been upfront about their stance on kids, which is important in a relationship. It's reasonable for someone to know their own preferences and not want to be in a situation where they're expected to change. The boyfriend's push for kids might be his deal-breaker, but the author isn't obligated to comply if it goes against their core values. Also, financial instability is a real factor in deciding not to have kids. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they've made their position clear from the start. It seems like both parties have the right to their choices, and the author isn't wrong for sticking to their decision. So the answer is B.\n"
