I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for not wanting children. The author is female in her mid-20s, been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's clear she never wants kids and has communicated that to partners before, including her current boyfriend. He's older, and they both work full-time in a small apartment they can't even afford. She's gotten snippy comments about kids, and she shut down the conversation, even saying he should leave if he wants kids. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but the author insists she does. Her reasons include cost, work, and personal preference for dogs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle here. The author has been upfront about her stance on kids from the start. She's been with her boyfriend a long time, so he should be aware of her position. If he's bringing up kids after five years despite knowing her stance, that's on him. The author isn't obligated to change her mind if it's a non-negotiable. However, the boyfriend's frustration might be valid if he expected the conversation to open up over time. But the author hasn't given any indication she's reconsidering. \n\nFinancial stability is another factor. They can't even afford their apartment, so having kids would be unrealistic. Her decision is practical. Also, the emotional aspect: the boyfriend's mom's opinion is her own, not his necessarily. The author's firmness in her decision might come off as harsh, but she's being honest. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author communicated her stance early on, so the boyfriend should have considered that. If he's not happy with that after five years, maybe the relationship isn't compatible. The author isn't in the wrong for sticking to her values, especially when it's a deal-breaker for her. The boyfriend might need to accept that or move on. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
