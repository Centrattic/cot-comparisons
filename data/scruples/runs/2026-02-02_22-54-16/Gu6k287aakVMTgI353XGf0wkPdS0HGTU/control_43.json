I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting kids and shutting down conversations about it in her five-year relationship.\n\nFirst, the author has known since 16 that she doesn't want kids. That's a long time to have had this stance, which might indicate it's a strong personal belief. She's been upfront with her boyfriends about this, which is good communication. The boyfriend has been with her for over five years, so they've been in the relationship long enough for this to come up multiple times. She shuts down the conversation each time, which could be a problem if he feels his needs aren't being heard or addressed. \n\nHe's older, and maybe he expects different things in a long-term relationship. The fact that his mom is involved and thinks the author doesn't love him adds another layer. The author claims they can't afford kids and both work full-time, which are valid concerns. She also mentions wanting dogs instead, which are a different kind of commitment. \n\nBut the key points here are communication and mutual respect. If she's been clear from the start and consistent in her decision, she's not in the wrong. However, if she's not allowing any discussion or exploring alternatives (like adoption or fostering), it might be an issue. Also, telling him to leave if he wants kids could be harsh, but if he's aware of her stance and still brings it up repeatedly, maybe she's justified in being firm. \n\nFinancial instability is a real factor. Kids are expensive, so if they can't even afford their apartment, that's a legitimate concern. However, relationships require compromise. If the boyfriend's desire for kids is non-negotiable and she's unwilling to compromise, maybe the relationship isn't sustainable. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. The author hasn't forced the issue; she's communicated her stance. The boyfriend might need to accept that or consider if the relationship is right for him. The author's firm response (\"if kids is what he want he should leave\") might come off as extreme, but if he's repeatedly pushing despite her clear position, she's protecting her own boundaries. \n\nSo, based on the information given, the author hasn't done anything wrong. She's been honest and is prioritizing her own values and financial realities. The boyfriend's mom's opinion isn't a valid reason to change her stance. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
