I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids. The author is in her mid-20s, has been with her boyfriend for over five years, and has always been clear about not wanting children. She's made sure her partners knew this before getting into relationships. Her boyfriend, who's older, has been making comments about having kids, and she shuts down those conversations. She even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but the author insists she does.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has been upfront about her stance on children from the start. She's been in a long-term relationship, which suggests she values honesty and communication. The boyfriend is older, which might mean he has different priorities, possibly expecting a family. The author is clear that financial constraints and her personal wants (like wanting dogs instead) make kids impractical for her. \n\nThe boyfriend's snippy comments and the mother's opinion indicate that there's some tension around this issue. The author's firm stance might be causing conflict, but she's consistent in her position. It's important to note that not wanting children is a personal choice, and there's no one-size-fits-all answer. However, relationships require mutual respect for each other's values. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author communicated her stance early and the boyfriend accepted it initially, then he might have known to not expect kids. However, if he's now pushing for it despite her clear position, that could be his issue. The author has the right to her choice, but if the relationship is suffering because of this, it might be a matter of compatibility rather than who's wrong. \n\nAlso, the author's statement that she told him to leave if he wants kids shows she's setting boundaries. The boyfriend's mother's opinion doesn't change the fact that the author's choice is valid. Financial issues and personal preferences are legitimate reasons. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. Her decision is based on personal values and realistic circumstances, and she's communicated this clearly. The conflict arises from the boyfriend's expectations versus her firm stance, but that's a matter of differing priorities in a relationship.\n"
