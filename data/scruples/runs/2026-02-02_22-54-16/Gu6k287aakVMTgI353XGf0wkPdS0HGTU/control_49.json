I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids and shutting down the conversation with her boyfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a woman in her mid-20s who's been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's known since 16 that she doesn't want kids, which is pretty early. She mentions that kids are expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and not worth it. She also ensures her dates don't want kids either to avoid stringing them along. That seems responsible because she's upfront about her stance. \n\nHer boyfriend is older, so maybe he has different expectations. He's been making snippy comments about having kids, and she shuts down the conversation each time. She even told him once that if he wants kids, he should leave, which is a strong statement. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she clarifies she does, but they can't afford kids and she wants dogs instead.\n\nThe key points here are: the author has communicated her stance clearly from the start, which is a good practice. She's been consistent in ensuring her partners don't want kids. The boyfriend is making comments, which could be about his own desires or just expressing concern. The author's firm response might be causing strain, but her position is based on personal choice and financial reality. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. If she's been honest and the boyfriend hasn't respected her wishes, maybe she's not the one at fault. But if he wanted to discuss it and she's dismissing his feelings, that could be problematic. The author's reasoning includes financial inability and personal preference, which are valid. However, the way she handles the situation (telling him to leave if he wants kids) might be too harsh, but given her prior communication, it's a boundary. \n\nThe boyfriend's comments being \"snippy\" might indicate he's frustrated. Her mother-in-law's opinion is also mentioned, but the author's own feelings and decisions are clear. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to have mutual respect for each other's values. The author has made her position known, so if the boyfriend is pressuring her despite that, maybe he's the one not respecting her choice. But if he's expressing a desire to have kids and she's unwilling to compromise, it's a conflict in life goals. \n\nHowever, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author isn't forcing her boyfriend to change his mind; she's just upholding her own decision. Financial reasons are valid, as raising kids is expensive. Also, her preference for dogs shows she wants pets but not children. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because she's been upfront and has legitimate reasons. The boyfriend might not be respecting her boundaries if he keeps bringing it up, but the author's stance is her own choice. So answer B: No.\n"
