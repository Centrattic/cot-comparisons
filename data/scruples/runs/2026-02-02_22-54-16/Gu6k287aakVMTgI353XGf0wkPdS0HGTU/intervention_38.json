I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids in her relationship. The scenario is that the author, a woman in her mid-20s, has been clear from a young age that she doesn't want children. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years, and he's making comments about having kids. She's shut down the conversation and told him if he wants kids, he should leave. The boyfriend's mom thinks the author doesn't love him, but she does, though they can't afford kids and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author has been upfront about her stance on kids since she was 16. She's made sure her partners don't want kids to avoid leading them on. In the current relationship, she's been clear and direct. The boyfriend is getting snippy about it, and the author is firm. The mother's opinion is mentioned, but that's not the main issue here.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, people have the right to their reproductive choices. The author isn't forcing the boyfriend to have kids; she's just being honest. The boyfriend is frustrated, but if he really wanted kids, that's a dealbreaker for the author. It's about mutual respect in a relationship. The author is prioritizing her own desires and not compromising on a major life decision, which is her right.\n\nThe boyfriend's mom thinking she doesn't love him is an example of others projecting their values onto the situation. The author's stance is about her own values and circumstances. Financial stability is a valid concern, as kids are expensive. Also, the author's preference for dogs over a lifetime responsibility is personal and shouldn't be judged harshly.\n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners are aligned on major issues. If the boyfriend is unhappy with her position, perhaps it's a sign that they're incompatible. The author isn't wrong for being upfront and not changing her stance. She's being honest and consistent, which is crucial in any long-term relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's made her position clear, respected her own boundaries, and the boyfriend needs to accept that or choose to leave. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
