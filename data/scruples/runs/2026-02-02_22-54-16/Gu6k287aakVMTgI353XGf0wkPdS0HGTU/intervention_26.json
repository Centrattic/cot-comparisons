I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is about not wanting kids and the boyfriend not being okay with that.\n\nFirst, the author has been clear from a young age that she doesn't want kids. She's been upfront with her partners about this, which is good. It's important in relationships to have these discussions early. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years and has consistently shut down conversations about having kids. He's bringing it up, and she's firm in her stance. \n\nNow, the boyfriend is older, and his mom is involved, which might add pressure. The author argues that they can't afford kids, they both work full-time, and she wants dogs instead. These are valid points. People have different values and priorities, and not wanting kids is a personal choice. \n\nBut the question is if she's in the wrong. Being in the wrong would mean she's done something unethical or unfair. She's been honest from the start, so she's not leading him on. However, relationships require compromise. If the boyfriend is having significant issues with this, it might be a deal-breaker for him. But the author isn't obligated to change her stance if it's non-negotiable for her. \n\nThe key here is mutual respect and understanding. If both parties can't find a middle ground, it might lead to the relationship ending, but that's not necessarily the author's fault. She's not forcing him to stay; she's just being honest. So I think she's not in the wrong.\n"
