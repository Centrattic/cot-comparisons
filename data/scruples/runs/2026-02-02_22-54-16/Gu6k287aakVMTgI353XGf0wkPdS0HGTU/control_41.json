I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman in her mid-20s who's been in a five-year relationship and has made her stance on not wanting kids clear from a young age. She's firm, even telling her boyfriend he should leave if he wants kids, which he has brought up and she's shutting down the conversation. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she says she does. They can't afford kids and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if her actions are wrong. The key points here are her honesty from the start, the length of the relationship, and the fact that she's consistent in her views. She's been clear about her no-children stance even before dating him, and they've been together over five years. That's a significant time, so he should have known her position long before any recent arguments. If he's still bringing up kids now, maybe he hasn't respected her boundaries. Also, financial stability is a valid concern. They can't afford a child, which is a real-life issue. She's not stringing him along; she's been upfront. His mother's opinion is her own, but the woman does love him but can't compromise on kids. It's a personal choice, and unless the boyfriend was explicitly okay with no kids but changed his mind, she's in the right. The boyfriend might need to accept her stance or leave. So the answer is B, No, she's not in the wrong.\n"
