I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids. The situation is that the author is in a 5-year relationship, has been clear about not wanting children since she was young, and her boyfriend is getting comments about it. She's firm in her stance and even told him to leave if he wants kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has been upfront about her no-children stance from the start. She's made it a priority to date people who also don't want kids. Her boyfriend, who's older, is pushing for kids, but she's not budging. Also, they can't afford kids financially, and she wants dogs instead. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. From a rights perspective, people have the right to make personal choices about their bodies and family planning. She's not forcing him; she's being honest. However, relationships require mutual respect. If he wants kids and she can't compromise, it might be a deal-breaker for him. But she's not wrong for having her own boundaries. \n\nLooking at the comments from his mom, it seems there's external pressure, but the author's love isn't the issue. The main conflict is differing life goals. She's not being inconsiderate; she's sticking to her values. Financial constraints are real and add to the argument against having kids. \n\nIn many cases, when both partners can't meet on a major issue like children, it's a valid reason for the relationship to end. The author isn't wrong for being clear and not entertaining the idea. She's responsible for her own desires and communicates them, which is important in relationships. So, the answer is B.\n"
