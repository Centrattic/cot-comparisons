I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman in her mid-20s who has been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's been clear from a young age that she doesn't want kids. She's made sure her partners knew this, and now her boyfriend is giving her snippy comments about having kids. She shuts the conversation down and even told him to leave if that's what he wants. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she does, and they can't afford kids anyway. She wants dogs instead.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, at fault) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the key points: The author has been upfront about her stance on kids from the start. She's maintained that position through her relationships, including this current one. The boyfriend is older, and they've been together five years. He's bringing up the topic and getting pushback. The author is firm in her no-kids stance, citing financial reasons and personal desire for pets instead.\n\nIn relationships, especially long-term ones, it's important that both partners are aligned on major life decisions like having children. The author has communicated her wishes clearly, so it's not her fault for not changing her mind later. The boyfriend, on the other hand, might need to accept that if this is a deal-breaker for him. However, if he's been bringing it up repeatedly despite her clear stance, maybe he hasn't respected her boundaries. The mother's opinion isn't relevant here; her judgment shouldn't override the couple's own relationship dynamics.\n\nFinancial instability is another factor. They can't even afford their apartment, so having kids would be unrealistic. The author's decision is practical as well as personal. She's also considering the well-being of both herself and the boyfriend by not forcing a situation that neither can handle. \n\nThe main issue is whether the author is at fault for not entertaining the idea. Since she's been open and consistent, and the boyfriend hasn't respected her boundaries by pushing the issue, the fault isn't on her. The boyfriend might need to reevaluate if he can accept her stance or if this is a deal-breaker for him. But in this scenario, the author isn't wrong for maintaining her position.\n"
