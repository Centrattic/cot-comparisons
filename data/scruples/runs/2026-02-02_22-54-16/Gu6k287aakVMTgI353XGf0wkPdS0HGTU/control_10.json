I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids and shutting down the conversation with her boyfriend. First, I need to consider the key points from the scenario.\n\nThe author is in her mid-20s, has known since 16 that she doesn't want kids. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years, and he's older. She's made it clear from the start that she doesn't want kids, but he keeps bringing it up. She shuts down the conversation and even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but the author insists she does. They can't afford kids and prefer dogs instead.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate if she's in the wrong. The main factors here are mutual respect in a relationship, communication, and personal choices. The author has been upfront about her stance on kids since the beginning. That seems responsible because she's not leading him on. However, maybe she should have explored the issue more deeply with him to understand his feelings and see if they can find common ground. But the fact that she's been consistent and clear suggests she's not being unfair. \n\nFinancial stability is another point. They can't afford kids, which is a valid concern. Also, the boyfriend's mother's opinion might be influencing him, which could add pressure. The author's decision not to have kids is personal and her right, but maybe the relationship is facing issues that need more than just shutting down the conversation. However, the user is asking if she's in the wrong, not if the relationship is doomed.\n\nIn most cases, people have the right to make personal choices about their lives, including having children. The author isn't forcing him to do anything; she's just stating her position. If he's not willing to accept that, maybe the problem is on his side for not respecting her decision. But sometimes, in relationships, both partners need to be flexible. However, since she's been clear from the start, it's hard to say she's in the wrong now. The key here is communication. If she's not engaging in the conversation, that could be a problem. But she's made her stance clear, so maybe it's his issue for not accepting her boundaries. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's made her position known, and it's her right to choose. However, there's a nuance that maybe she could have approached the conversation more empathetically. But overall, her position is valid.\n"
