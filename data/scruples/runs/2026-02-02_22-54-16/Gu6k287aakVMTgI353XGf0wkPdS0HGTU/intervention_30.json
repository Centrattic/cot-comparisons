I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The person is a woman in her mid-20s who has been in a relationship for over five years. She's known since 16 that she doesn't want kids. She's been upfront with her boyfriend about this, making sure he doesn't want kids too. Now, he's been making snippy comments about having kids, and she's shutting those conversations down. She even told him that if he wants kids, he should leave because she won't do it. His mom thinks the author doesn't love him, but she does. They can't afford kids, and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has been clear about her stance on having children from the start. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years, so this isn't a recent issue. She's made her position known to both him and his mom. The boyfriend is making comments, but she's not budging. She's even told him directly that he should leave if that's what he wants. The financial aspect is a real concern, and she's prioritizing other things like wanting dogs.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The main factors here are communication and mutual expectations. The author has been honest about her feelings towards children. If the boyfriend knew this from the start, and he still chose to be in the relationship, he might be at fault for not respecting her boundaries. However, he's been making snippy comments, which could indicate that he's not accepting her position, even after five years. That could lead to conflict in the relationship, but the author is standing her ground, which is her right.\n\nThe part where she told him to leave if he wants kids is a strong statement, but if she's been consistent and clear, she's not wrong in asserting her stance. The boyfriend's mom's opinion isn't relevant here; the couple's decisions should be based on their own agreement. The financial aspect is a valid reason not to have kids, and wanting dogs instead is a personal preference.\n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to align on major life decisions like having children. Since the author has communicated her stance and the boyfriend is now trying to push for kids, it's a matter of whether he respects her decision. If he can't accept her position, then the issue lies with him. The author is not in the wrong for being honest and not changing her mind, especially when the decision is deeply personal and based on her values and circumstances.\n"
