I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not considering having kids. The situation is that the author has been clear since she was 16 that she doesn't want kids, and she's been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's shutting down conversations about kids, even telling him he should leave if that's what he wants. The boyfriend's mom is critical of her, and there's financial issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has been upfront about her stance on not wanting children from the start. She's been in a long-term relationship and has made sure partners know her position. That seems responsible. She's also citing financial reasons, which are valid. The boyfriend is older, which might mean he has different expectations, but if she's communicated clearly, maybe the issue is his readiness to accept that. The boyfriend's mom's opinion might be external pressure but not the main issue here.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The main factors are communication, mutual respect in a relationship, and personal choice. Since she's been clear and consistent, it's unlikely she's at fault. The boyfriend might need to adjust his expectations or consider if this is a deal-breaker for him. The author isn't forcing him to stay, but if he's unhappy, it's his choice. So the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
