I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a woman in her mid-20s, has always known she doesn't want kids and has been upfront with her partners. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years, and he's older. He keeps bringing up the topic of having kids, and she shuts it down each time, even telling him he should leave if that's what he wants. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she insists she does. They can't afford kids, and she prefers dogs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has been clear from the start about her stance on having children. She's been with the boyfriend for over five years and has been consistent. Communication is a big part here. She's made her position known, so she's not keeping it a secret. The boyfriend's mom is judging her, but that's not the author's fault. Financial stability is a concern, and she's choosing to have pets instead of kids.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. In relationships, it's important for both partners to be on the same page regarding major life decisions. If one partner's deal-breaker is having kids and the other can't accept that, it's a significant issue. The author has made her stance clear, so she's not being deceptive. However, after five years, the boyfriend might be feeling that the conversation isn't moving forward. But the author isn't forcing him to stay; she's told him he should leave if he wants kids. That's a strong stance, but it's her right to set boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel dismissed or not heard. However, the author has been consistent. Her financial argument is valid, and she's also clear about her personal preferences. The mother's judgment is an external factor but doesn't affect the author's responsibility. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong because she's been upfront and consistent about her position. The boyfriend might need to decide if he can accept her choice, but the author isn't being deceptive or inconsiderate.\n"
