I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman in her mid-20s who's been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's always been against having kids and has been clear about it. The boyfriend's family, especially his mom, is making snippy comments about kids, and he's bringing it up too. She's shut down the conversations and even said if he wants kids, he should leave. The user thinks she's not in the wrong, but wants to know what I think.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. She's known since 16 that she doesn't want kids, which is pretty early. She's been upfront with her partners about it, so she's not leading anyone on. The boyfriend has known this for over five years. The financial argument is valid too\u2014they can't even afford their apartment, so adding kids would be a stretch. She also mentions wanting dogs instead, which is a personal choice.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that his desires aren't being considered. Maybe he wants kids and feels the relationship is heading in a direction that's incompatible. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. If she's been clear all along and they've been together for five years, then she's not keeping it a secret. The boyfriend might need to accept that if having kids is a deal-breaker for him, then maybe he's not ready for a long-term commitment with her. \n\nThe mom's opinion is also mentioned, but family opinions don't necessarily validate his stance if he's been aware all this time. The woman isn't forcing him into anything; she's just being honest. Her stance is about her own values and practicalities. So, it seems like she's not at fault here. The boyfriend might need to reassess his own priorities versus hers. Therefore, the answer should be B, No, she's not in the wrong.\n"
