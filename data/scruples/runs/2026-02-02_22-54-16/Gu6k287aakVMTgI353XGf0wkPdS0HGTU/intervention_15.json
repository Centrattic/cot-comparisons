I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids. The author has been clear about her stance since she was 16, communicated it with her boyfriend early on, and is in a long-term relationship where they can't afford children. She's also upfront with her boyfriend and his mom, though the mom seems to misunderstand her feelings. \n\nThe main points to consider are communication and mutual agreement in a relationship. The author made her position clear before getting into the relationship and continues to communicate it. The boyfriend might have different desires, but the author isn't pressuring him; instead, she's firm in her decision. Financial instability is another factor, which adds to the impracticality of having kids. \n\nThe boyfriend's mom's judgment about not loving him is a red herring because love and wanting kids are separate issues. The author loves him but can't compromise on her stance. In relationships, it's essential for both partners to agree on major life decisions like having children. Since the author has been transparent and the boyfriend hasn't left despite knowing this, it seems like they've managed to navigate this aspect. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend might feel frustrated if kids are a deal-breaker for him. But according to the information given, the author isn't hiding anything and is honest about her limits. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The key is that both people have the right to their choices as long as they're communicated clearly. Hence, the answer should be B.\n"
