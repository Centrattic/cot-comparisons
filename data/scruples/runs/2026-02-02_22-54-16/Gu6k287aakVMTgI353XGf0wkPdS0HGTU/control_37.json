I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids. The situation is that she's been with her boyfriend for over five years and has consistently made her stance clear since she was 16. She shuts down conversations about kids and even told him to leave if that's what he wants. Her reasons are financial, workload, and personal preference for dogs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if she's in the wrong. The key points here are communication and mutual respect in a relationship. She's been upfront from the start, so there's no deception. Relationships require both parties to have compatible values. If her partner can't accept her clear decision, maybe that's an issue on his part. However, the boyfriend has been pushing for kids, which could indicate a fundamental incompatibility.\n\nThe user might be looking for validation that being honest about one's desires isn't wrong. Also, financial instability is a real concern, and she's being practical. But relationships need to work both ways. If the boyfriend isn't respecting her boundaries, that's a red flag. However, if she's been dismissive and hasn't considered compromise, maybe that's a problem.\n\nBut in this case, she's made her position clear for years and hasn't budged. The boyfriend's mom is involved, which adds external pressure. The author's actions seem consistent with her values, and she's not pressuring him into something he wants. So, the question is whether not entertaining the idea is wrong. Since she's communicated her stance and the partner hasn't adjusted his expectations, perhaps the fault lies with the boyfriend, not the author. Thus, the answer is B.\n"
