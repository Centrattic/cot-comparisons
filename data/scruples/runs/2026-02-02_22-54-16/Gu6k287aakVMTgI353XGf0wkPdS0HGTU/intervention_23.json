I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The question is about whether not wanting kids and being upfront about it with a partner makes them at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The author is a woman in her mid-20s with a boyfriend for over five years. She's known since 16 she doesn't want kids. She's been clear with partners about this, and her current boyfriend is older. He's making comments about having kids, and she shuts down the conversation. She even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she does. They can't afford kids, and she wants dogs instead.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants confirmation. The answer options are A (Yes, wrong) or B (No, not wrong).\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author has been upfront about her stance on kids, the relationship is long-term, financial constraints, and the boyfriend's family's opinion. The question is about whether her refusal to consider kids is unfair, especially since the boyfriend is older and might have different expectations.\n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to have aligned values and discuss them early. The author has been clear from the start, which is responsible. The boyfriend might be conflicted, but the author isn't hiding her stance. The fact that they can't afford kids adds another layer, making it a practical issue too. The boyfriend's mother's judgment is an external factor but doesn't justify the author being wrong if she's honest with her partner.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't being deceptive or stringing him along. She's made her position known and stands by it. So the answer should be B, not in the wrong.\n"
