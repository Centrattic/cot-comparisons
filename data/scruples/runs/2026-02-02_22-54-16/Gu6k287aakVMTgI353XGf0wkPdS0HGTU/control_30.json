I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids. The situation is that the author is in her mid-20s, has always known she doesn't want kids, and has been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's made her stance clear, and when he brings up kids, she shuts the conversation down. His mom even thinks she doesn't love him, but she does. They can't afford kids, and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her rights. Everyone has the right to personal choices, especially regarding having children. She's been upfront from the start, which is important. The boyfriend, on the other hand, might have different desires, but if he hasn't respected her boundaries, that's a problem. The fact that she's been clear about her stance for years suggests she's not being deceptive.\n\nFinancial stability is another point. They can't even afford a small apartment, so kids would be a huge burden. Her prioritizing her own life and wanting pets instead is her choice. The boyfriend's mom's opinion isn't her responsibility; she's not the one in the relationship. However, if the boyfriend is pressuring her beyond what she's comfortable with, that's a red flag for him.\n\nBut wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. She's making a choice that's consistent with her values and has communicated it. The boyfriend might need to adjust his expectations. However, if the relationship is causing conflict because of this, maybe there's a deeper issue. But the author isn't at fault for not changing her mind based on the boyfriend's desires. She's also considering practical aspects like cost and lifestyle.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. She's made her position clear, and it's the boyfriend's responsibility to accept or adjust to that. His mother's judgment isn't her problem either. The key here is mutual respect for each other's boundaries, which she's upheld.\n"
