I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting kids in her long-term relationship. The scenario is that she's been clear about her stance on not wanting children since she was 16, and she's been with her boyfriend for over five years. He's been making comments about having kids, and she's shut those conversations down, even telling him he should leave if that's what he wants. Her mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she argues they can't afford kids and she prefers dogs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has been upfront about her feelings on having children from a young age. She's made sure her partners know this before getting into relationships, which shows she's being honest and not leading someone on. The boyfriend has been in the relationship for over five years, so he's had ample time to understand her position. The fact that he's now bringing up the topic and she's firm in her stance suggests that the conflict arises from his changing expectations or unmet desires, not from her being dishonest.\n\nFinancial stability is mentioned as a barrier, which is a valid concern. The author also mentions that they can't even afford their apartment, making the idea of kids seem unreasonable. Personal preferences, like wanting dogs instead of kids, are also part of her reasoning. These are personal choices that are valid as long as they don't harm others.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, both partners need to have compatible long-term goals. If having children is a deal-breaker for the boyfriend, then the author's refusal to compromise might lead to the end of the relationship. However, the author is not at fault for having her own values and making that clear. She's not forcing the issue; she's standing by her beliefs.\n\nThe boyfriend's mom's opinion is mentioned, but that's more about family perception rather than the actual relationship issues. The author's love for her boyfriend is stated, but love alone doesn't necessitate having children. The core issue here is differing life goals, and the author is not wrong for being honest about her stance. She's taking responsibility for her choices, which is important in a healthy relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because she's transparent about her desires, making decisions based on personal and financial realities, and standing by her values. The conflict stems from the boyfriend's expectations, not her dishonesty or inconsiderate behavior.\n"
