I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves a woman in her mid-20s who's been in a 5-year relationship and has consistently communicated her stance against having kids since she was 16. She's made sure her partners knew this, and now her current boyfriend is older and has been making snippy comments about having kids. She shuts down those conversations and told him if he wants kids, he should leave. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she claims she does. They can't afford kids and she prefers having dogs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has been clear from the start about her no-children stance. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years and has consistently communicated her position. When the topic comes up, she shuts it down, which is her right since it's her personal choice. The boyfriend is making comments that make her shut down the conversation, which might indicate he's not respecting her boundaries. The mother's opinion is mentioned, but the boyfriend's mom isn't the one in a relationship, so her opinion might not be the main issue here.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). From what I see, the author has been upfront about her stance, which is important in relationships. The boyfriend is the one bringing up the topic repeatedly, which could be a problem if he's not respecting her boundaries. The fact that she's been in the relationship for five years and has maintained this stance suggests she's consistent. The financial argument about not being able to afford kids is practical, and her preference for dogs over kids is a personal choice. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author's strong reaction (telling him to leave if he wants kids) could be seen as dismissive. But given that they've been together for five years and she's been consistent, maybe her stance is firm. The boyfriend's comments might be pushing her buttons, and her response is a defense of her position. \n\nThe key is whether she's wrong for not entertaining the idea. Since she's been clear from the start and the issue is recurring, it's more about mutual respect. If the boyfriend is not respecting her boundaries by bringing it up repeatedly, then the fault isn't on her. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
