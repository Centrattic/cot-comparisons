I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for not wanting kids and shutting down conversations about it.\n\nFirst, the author has been clear about not wanting children since she was 16. She's been in a relationship for over five years and has made sure her partner doesn't want kids either. That shows she's been upfront from the beginning, which is important in any relationship, especially regarding major life decisions like having kids.\n\nThe boyfriend is older, and he's been making snippy comments about the possibility of having kids. Each time, she shuts the conversation down. She even told him that if having kids is what he wants, he should leave. That's a strong stance, but she's standing by her decision. Her reasoning includes financial instability\u2014both work full-time and can't afford their apartment, let alone children. She also mentions she wants dogs instead of a lifetime responsibility, which adds to her personal preferences.\n\nThe boyfriend's mother thinks the author doesn't love him, but she insists she does. The key here is communication. The author has communicated her stance repeatedly, so if the boyfriend is still bringing it up and getting upset, maybe he hasn't respected her boundaries. In relationships, especially long-term ones, major differences like child preferences need mutual respect. If one partner is consistently unhappy with the other's stance, it might be a deal-breaker, but the author hasn't forced the issue; she's given clear warnings.\n\nFinancial reasons are valid. Raising kids is expensive, and if they can't afford their current situation, adding a child would be unrealistic. Her decision is based on practicality and personal choice, not just convenience. Also, she's not trying to change her own stance; she's firm in her decision, which is her right.\n\nThe boyfriend's mom's opinion might be irrelevant here unless she's involved in their relationship dynamics, but the main issue is between the couple. The author isn't pressuring him to have kids; she's making her position clear. If the boyfriend can't accept that, then the problem lies with him, not the author.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong. She's communicated her position, made responsible decisions based on her values and circumstances, and the boyfriend hasn't been able to accept that. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
