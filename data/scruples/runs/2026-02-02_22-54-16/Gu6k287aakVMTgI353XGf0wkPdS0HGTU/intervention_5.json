I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids and shutting down conversations about it in a long-term relationship. The author has been clear about her stance since she was 16 and communicates this to her partners. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years and he's older. He's making snippy comments about having kids, and she's firm in her decision, even telling him to leave if that's what he wants. The boyfriend's mom is involved, thinking the author doesn't love him, but the author insists she does.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author has been consistent in her no-children stance for a long time and communicates this to her partners. She's not stringing people along; she makes sure potential partners are on the same page. In this current relationship, she's been upfront, but the boyfriend is still bringing up the topic and the mother is involved. The author is clear that she's not willing to have kids, which is a major life decision. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be causing tension, but the author is firm in her choice. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The main question is about whether not entertaining the idea of having kids is wrong, especially in a long-term relationship where the partner has different desires. The author is being honest and upfront, which is important in relationships. She's also pragmatic, mentioning financial constraints and her own priorities (wanting dogs instead of children). The boyfriend's comments and his mother's judgment might indicate that he hasn't fully accepted this decision, which could be a problem for him, not the author.\n\nIn relationships, differing wants about children can be a deal-breaker. The author is clear from the start, so she's not misleading anyone. The boyfriend's persistence in bringing up the topic despite her stance might suggest he hasn't processed his own feelings or is not respecting her boundaries. The mother's interference could be complicating things further, but the author isn't responsible for the mother's opinions. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. She's being honest, consistent, and upfront. The issue seems to be on the boyfriend's side for not respecting her decision and the mother's judgment. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
