I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not entertaining having kids. The author has been in a 5-year relationship and has clearly communicated her stance on not wanting children from a young age. She's been upfront with her boyfriend and even mentions that he knows her position. The boyfriend is getting snippy about it, and the author is firm in her decision, even telling him to leave if that's what he wants.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author made her position clear from the start. She's been consistent and direct, which is important in relationships. The boyfriend's comments suggest he might be unhappy with this decision, but the author isn't budging. The user is asking if she's in the wrong. \n\nNow, from a general perspective, people have different values. Choosing not to have kids isn't inherently wrong. The author has valid reasons: financial constraints, the workload, personal preference for pets over children. She's also being responsible by not leading someone on who might want kids. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend's perspective is also valid. If he wants children and the author is unwilling to compromise, that's a significant difference. But it's about whether the author is wrong for holding her stance. The question isn't about the boyfriend's feelings but the author's actions. \n\nThe author has made her position known and is acting on it. Unless she's being deceptive or isn't considering his feelings (though she does mention he's unhappy), she's not necessarily in the wrong. Relationships require mutual agreement on major issues like children. If he can't accept her stance, maybe the relationship isn't compatible. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), she's not in the wrong. She's being upfront and honest, and her reasons are legitimate. The boyfriend's pushback is his issue to reconcile, not hers to fix.\n"
