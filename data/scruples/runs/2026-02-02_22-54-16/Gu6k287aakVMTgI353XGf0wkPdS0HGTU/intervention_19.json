I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The person is a woman in her mid-20s who's been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's been clear from a young age that she doesn't want kids and has made sure her partners knew that. Now, her boyfriend is giving her snippy comments about having kids, and she shuts down the conversations, even telling him he should leave if he wants kids. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she insists she does. They can't afford kids, and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points here. The woman has been consistent about her stance on not wanting children. She's communicated this upfront in relationships, which is important. However, her current boyfriend has been with her for over five years, so maybe he expected a different outcome in the long term. The fact that she's shut down conversations and told him he should leave if he wants kids shows she's firm, but that might be causing tension.\n\nFinancial stability is another factor. They can't afford kids, which is a legitimate concern. Also, she mentions wanting dogs instead, which is a personal choice. The boyfriend's mother's opinion is mentioned, but that's more about family pressure than the core issue.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, people have the right to make personal choices about their lives, including having children or not. She's not forcing him to have kids; she's making her boundaries clear. However, some might argue that not considering having kids at all could be selfish if the partner truly wants them. But in this case, she's been clear from the start, so he knew what he was getting into. Relationships require mutual agreement on major life decisions. If he wants kids and she doesn't, it's a dealbreaker. The boyfriend might need to accept that or consider ending the relationship if his needs aren't met. \n\nHer response of telling him to leave if he wants kids is strong, but it's a reflection of her stance. It's possible that the boyfriend feels unvalued or unheard, but she's standing by her decision. The key here is whether she's acted in bad faith. She's been honest and consistent. There's no indication she's been deceptive. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
