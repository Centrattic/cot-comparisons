I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids in their long-term relationship. The author is a woman in her mid-20s, has been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's been clear from the start that she doesn't want kids, and he's older. Now, he's starting to make comments about having kids, and she's been shutting down those conversations. She even told him that if he wants kids, he should leave because she's not going to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points here. The author has been upfront about her stance on children since she was 16. That's pretty early, and she's made sure previous partners knew. With her current boyfriend, she's been clear from the start as well. They've been together for a long time, which suggests some level of commitment. Now, he's bringing up the topic again, and she's pushing back. The boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but the author insists she does. Financial reasons are mentioned as a barrier, along with wanting dogs instead of kids.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the author is wrong for not entertaining the idea of kids. The question is about whether her position is valid. In relationships, differing values like wanting children versus not wanting them can be a major point of contention. The author has been consistent in her stance and communicated it clearly. However, the boyfriend's increasing push for kids might indicate that his own views are changing, or that he hadn't fully considered her position. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is trying to be honest and not lead him on if she's not willing to have kids. She's even said if that's what he wants, he should leave. That's a strong statement, but it's her way of maintaining honesty. On the other hand, maybe the boyfriend expected a change of heart over time or didn't take her stance as seriously as he should have. But the author has made her position clear for years, which is a long time for the boyfriend to consider whether he can accept that.\n\nFinancial stability is also a factor. They can't afford even a small apartment, so having kids would be even more challenging. The author feels it's unreasonable, which is a valid concern. Also, she wants dogs instead, which is a personal preference and doesn't make her wrong.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, if both partners have communicated their values and the boyfriend still chooses to be in the relationship despite knowing her stance, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, if the boyfriend hasn't addressed his own feelings or hasn't found a compromise, that's on him. The author is being honest, which is generally considered the right approach in relationships. She's not stringing him along if she's clear about her boundaries. \n\nBut maybe there's a cultural or societal expectation that people should be open to having kids, but that's changing. More people are choosing not to have children, and that's becoming more accepted. The boyfriend's mom's opinion might reflect outdated views where women are expected to want kids. However, the author's happiness and well-being are important too. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author has been consistent, honest, and clear. The boyfriend's comments and his mom's judgment don't make her wrong. The financial situation is a real barrier, and her preference for dogs is a personal choice. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
