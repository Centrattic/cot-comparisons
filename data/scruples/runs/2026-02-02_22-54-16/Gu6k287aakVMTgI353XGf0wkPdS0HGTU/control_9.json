I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids and shutting down conversations about it in her relationship. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years, and he's older. She's made it clear from a young age that she doesn't want kids, and she's been upfront with her partners. Now, he's making snippy comments about kids, and she's cutting off the conversation. She even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she does. They can't afford kids, and she prefers dogs.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation. She's been consistent in her stance on not wanting children since she was 16. When dating, she ensures potential partners are on the same page. That shows she's responsible and honest. Now, in a long-term relationship, she's firm but clear. Her reasons are valid: financial struggles, the workload, and personal preference. The boyfriend's family is involved, which adds pressure. But the key points are her consistency and communication.\n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. The main factors here are her honesty, the boyfriend's expectations, and whether her response is justified. She hasn't been deceptive; she's been upfront. The boyfriend might have different expectations, but if he hadn't considered her stance before committing to a five-year relationship, maybe he's at fault. However, relationships require compromise, and if he's unhappy, that's a problem too. But she's not wrong for setting boundaries. Her response of telling him to leave if he wants kids might be harsh, but given her stance, it's a boundary. The answer likely hinges on her right to make personal choices and her honesty versus the boyfriend's adjustment period. Since she's not being deceptive and is clear, she's probably not in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
