I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids in their relationship. Let's look at the situation.\n\nThe author is a woman in her mid-20s, in a 5-year relationship with a boyfriend older than her. She's been clear since she was 16 that she doesn't want kids. She's communicated this to her partners, ensuring they also don't want kids to avoid leading anyone on. Her boyfriend, however, has been making snippy comments about having kids. She shuts down the conversation each time and once told him if he wants kids, he should leave. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she does. They can't afford kids financially and she prefers having dogs instead.\n\nFirst, the key points here are communication and mutual agreement. The author has been upfront about her stance on kids from the start. The issue arises when the boyfriend hasn't respected her boundaries and continues to bring up the topic. The author's response\u2014telling him to leave if he wants kids\u2014might seem harsh, but consider the context: she's been clear, he's persistent, and she's standing her ground.\n\nFinancial stability is another factor. They can't even afford a small apartment, making kids unrealistic. The author's preference for dogs over kids shows her values align with what she can manage. The boyfriend's mom's opinion might add pressure, but it's not the author's responsibility to change her stance to satisfy others.\n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to agree on major life decisions. If one partner is non-negotiable on not having kids and the other can't accept that, it's a fundamental difference. The author isn't wrong for sticking to her values, especially when she's communicated them clearly. The boyfriend might need to decide if he can accept her position or if their future is incompatible.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's being honest and firm, which is necessary for a healthy relationship. The answer should be B.\n"
