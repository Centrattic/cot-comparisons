I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a woman in her mid-20s who has been with her boyfriend for over five years and has made it clear from a young age that she doesn't want kids. The boyfriend, who's older, has been giving snippy comments about having kids, and she shuts down those conversations. She even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. The boyfriend's mom is upset, thinking the woman doesn't love him, but she insists she does. They can't afford kids, and she wants dogs instead.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but is curious about my take. I need to decide if it's A (Yes, she's wrong) or B (No, she's not). \n\nFirst, the woman has been clear about her stance on kids since she was 16. She made sure previous partners didn't want kids to avoid leading them on. That shows she's been upfront. In a long-term relationship of over five years, she's been consistent in her position. The boyfriend is older, so maybe he had different expectations. But the woman's reasons are valid: financial, desire for pets instead, and the general work involved. \n\nThe boyfriend's comments are \"snippy,\" which might indicate that he's unhappy but hasn't had a serious conversation. The woman isn't forcing him to agree; she's making her position clear. Telling him to leave if he wants kids is a strong statement, but if she's been consistent and he hasn't addressed his feelings more directly, maybe the issue is that he hasn't communicated his needs either. \n\nHer argument about not being able to afford kids and wanting dogs instead is practical. The boyfriend's mom's opinion might be irrelevant unless the boyfriend is allowing his mother's views to influence him. \n\nSo, the woman is being honest about her non-negotiable, which is a key aspect in a relationship. The boyfriend might need to decide if he can accept her choice. If he's unhappy, it's on him to communicate that, but the woman isn't wrong for standing by her decision. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
