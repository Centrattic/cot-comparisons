I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is a female in her mid-20s who's been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's been clear from a young age, 16, that she doesn't want kids. Her reasoning is about the cost, the work involved, and it not being worth it. She's made sure all her past partners also didn't want kids to avoid leading them on. Now, her current boyfriend, who is older, has been bringing up the topic with snippy comments, and she shuts those conversations down. She even told him once that if he wants kids, he should leave, because she's not going to have them. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she actually does, and they can't afford kids because they work full-time and have a small apartment. She prefers having dogs instead of the lifetime responsibility of kids.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is her firm stance against having children and how she communicates it to her boyfriend and his mom. \n\nThe author has been upfront about her views on kids. From 16, she's known her preference, which is pretty early. She's also been proactive in ensuring her partners share her stance, which shows she's serious about this aspect of her life. In a long-term relationship (over 5 years), communication about major life decisions like having kids is crucial. The fact that she's addressing it directly, even if it's uncomfortable, might be necessary to maintain honesty. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend's situation is important too. He might have different expectations. The author's response of telling him to leave if he wants kids is strong, but if she's been consistent, maybe it's justified. The boyfriend's snippy comments could indicate he's trying to push her to reconsider, but the author is clear she won't. \n\nFinancial stability is a valid concern. The couple can't afford a child, and they live in a small apartment. The author's preference for dogs suggests she wants pets but not the full-time commitment of children. \n\nThe boyfriend's mom's opinion is a third party, but the author's love isn't in question. The mom's judgment might be misplaced, as the decision is between the couple. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether her approach is respectful. She's been clear, and if she's not budging, that's her right. However, the way she shuts down the conversation might be seen as dismissive. But given her prior history of being upfront, maybe it's just maintaining her boundaries. The boyfriend should respect her decision unless he's willing to accept it. If he's unhappy with that, maybe he should consider whether he can be in a relationship where having kids isn't an option. The author isn't forcing kids on anyone; she's just being honest. Therefore, the answer is likely B, No.\n"
