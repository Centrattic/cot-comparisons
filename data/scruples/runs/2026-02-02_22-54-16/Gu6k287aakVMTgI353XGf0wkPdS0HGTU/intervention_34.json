I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids and shutting down the conversation about it in her long-term relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has been clear from a young age that she doesn't want kids. She's made sure her partners don't want them either. She's been with her current boyfriend for over five years, and he's older. He's made snippy comments about kids, which she shuts down. She even told him to leave if that's what he wants. Her mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she clarifies she does. They can't afford kids financially, and she prefers having dogs instead.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From a rights perspective, people have the right to make personal choices about their bodies and family. The author is being honest about her stance, which is important in a relationship. She's not stringing him along, as she's been clear from the start. Her financial situation is a valid concern; having kids is expensive. Also, the boyfriend's comments might indicate a lack of respect for her decision, which could be an issue on his part.\n\nHowever, in relationships, communication is key. While she's shutting down the conversation, maybe there's a need for more open dialogue rather than just shutting it down. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not the boyfriend. Since she's being honest and they've been together for a long time, it's her right to decide not to have kids. Her mom's opinion doesn't change that. The key factors here are her honesty, personal choice, and the realistic financial situation. So, she isn't in the wrong.\n"
