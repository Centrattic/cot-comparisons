I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting kids and having a long-term relationship with a boyfriend who is now getting comments about their potential to have children.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. The author has always known she didn't want kids since 16, which suggests it's not a recent change. She's been upfront with her partners about this, which is important because transparency in relationships is crucial. The boyfriend has been with her for over five years, indicating a significant commitment. The fact that he's older might mean he has different expectations, but the author clearly communicated her stance from the start. \n\nThe boyfriend's mother thinks she doesn't love him, but the author asserts that she does. The financial aspect is mentioned\u2014both can't afford a small apartment, so having kids would be even more challenging. Also, the author mentions wanting dogs instead, which shows her preference for other forms of commitment. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's wrong for not entertaining the idea. Since she's been honest and the boyfriend hasn't left despite this, maybe the issue is about his reaction. But the author's stance is firm, and she's not forcing him to stay. She's not stringing him along because she's clear about her position. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that not considering alternatives or compromising could be problematic. But the author isn't open to it at all. However, given her long-held belief and communication, it's reasonable for her to stand by her decision. \n\nFinancial constraints are a valid point too. Kids are expensive, and if they can't even manage their current situation, adding a child would be unwise. The author's focus on personal desires (dogs) over kids also plays into her values. \n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting each other's decisions is key. The author isn't wrong if she's communicated her stance and he's chosen to stay. The boyfriend's family's opinion shouldn't override the couple's mutual decisions. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong because she's been transparent, and the decision is mutual as long as the boyfriend accepts it. The answer should be B (No).\n"
