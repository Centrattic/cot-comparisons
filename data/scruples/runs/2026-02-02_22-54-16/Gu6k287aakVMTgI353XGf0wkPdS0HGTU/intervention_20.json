I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's think about this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting kids and the boyfriend's reactions.\n\nFirst, the author has known since 16 that she doesn't want kids. That's a long time, so it's a deep-seated personal choice. She's been upfront with her boyfriends about this, which is good. The current boyfriend has been with her for over five years and has made snippy comments about having kids. She's shut down those conversations and even told him to leave if that's what he wants. \n\nThe boyfriend's mom is involved, thinking the author doesn't love him, but the author says she does. They also mention financial strain, not being able to afford an apartment, so having kids would be even harder. She wants dogs instead, which is a personal preference.\n\nThe key points here: the author is clear about her stance from the start, the boyfriend's comments are coming up after five years, and the financial situation is a real concern. The boyfriend might be expecting her to change her mind, but she hasn't. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, people have different values. Not wanting kids is a personal choice, and as long as she's honest, she's not obligated to want something she doesn't. The boyfriend might be unhappy, but that's on him if he can't accept her choice. The author isn't forcing him to stay or lie about her feelings. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong). She's being honest and upfront, and her reasons are valid. The boyfriend's frustration is his issue, not hers.\n"
