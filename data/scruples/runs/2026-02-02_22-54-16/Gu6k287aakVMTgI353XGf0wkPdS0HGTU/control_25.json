I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not wanting to have kids. The situation is that the author is in a long-term relationship and has made her stance clear for years. She doesn't want kids due to financial reasons, the workload, and preferring dogs. The boyfriend has been bringing up kids, and she shuts the conversation down. He's been getting snippy comments, and his mom thinks she doesn't love him despite her insistence that she does.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is wrong. She's been upfront about her feelings since she was 16, so she's had a long time to decide. In a relationship, it's important for both partners to have aligned values, especially on major life decisions like having children. The author is clear about her stance, which is a responsible approach because she doesn't want to string someone along. The boyfriend might be conflicted because he wants kids, but the author's position is firm. The fact that they can't even afford a small apartment suggests that having kids would be a huge financial strain, which is a valid concern. Also, the author's preference for dogs over kids is just her personal choice. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's side might feel that the author is being inflexible, but that's part of compatibility. If someone values kids highly, and their partner doesn't, it's a fundamental difference. The author isn't forcing him to stay; she even told him if that's what he wants, he should leave. So, she's taking responsibility for her choice and the potential consequences. His mom's opinion doesn't matter as much as their mutual compatibility. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because she's been honest, they have different values, and she's not making him stay. The boyfriend might need to realize that their differing views on children are deal-breakers for him, which is his own decision to make. The author isn't at fault here.\n"
