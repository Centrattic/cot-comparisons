I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman in her mid-20s in a five-year relationship where she's adamant about not having kids. Her boyfriend and his mom are pushing for it, and she's been clear about her stance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has communicated her no-children stance from the start, even before serious relationships. She's made sure her partners know this to avoid leading them on. The boyfriend has been with her for over five years, and despite that, he's still bringing up the topic, leading to tension with his mom thinking the author doesn't love him.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author has been upfront about her feelings, which is a mature approach. On the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that after five years, he's entitled to push for his desires. However, the author has a right to her own choice, especially regarding such a significant life decision as having children. She also mentions financial constraints and personal preferences (wanting dogs instead), which are valid considerations.\n\nHer response that if he wants kids, he should leave is a strong stance, but if both parties have discussed this and she's been consistent, it's her right to set boundaries. The boyfriend's mom's opinion about love is irrelevant here because the author does love him, just not in the context of having children.\n\nSocietal expectations might pressure her to reconsider, but personal autonomy is important. The author isn't forcing him to stay; she's just being honest about her limits. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for adhering to her values and maintaining clear communication.\n"
