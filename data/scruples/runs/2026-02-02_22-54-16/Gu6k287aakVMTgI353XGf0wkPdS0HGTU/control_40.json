I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The author is a woman in her mid-20s in a five-year relationship with her boyfriend, who is older. She's been clear since she was 16 that she doesn't want kids, and she's only dated people who share that view. Now her boyfriend is making snippy comments about having kids, which she shuts down. She even told him that if he wants kids, he should leave. The boyfriend's mom thinks the author doesn't love him, but the author claims she does, though they can't afford kids anyway.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author has been upfront about not wanting kids from the start. She's been in a long-term relationship and the boyfriend is now bringing up the topic, which he's not happy with. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not entertaining the idea of having kids now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social aspects. In relationships, communication is key. The author has communicated her stance clearly, which is important. However, the boyfriend's persistent comments might indicate a conflict in their values. The author's response of telling him to leave if he wants kids is strong, but maybe she's being firm because she knows their financial situation doesn't support children. \n\nIs it wrong to not want kids, even if a partner does? In many modern relationships, people have differing views on having children. If both partners can't reconcile these differences, it's a deal-breaker. The author hasn't changed her stance, and she's consistent in her communication. The boyfriend, on the other hand, hasn't respected her position and is pushing the issue, which might be the real problem here. The mother's opinion might not be relevant to the couple's decision.\n\nFinancial stability is a common concern about having kids, and the author is realistic about their current situation. Wanting a dog instead shows her desire for a pet but not the commitment of children. \n\nSo, the author isn't being inconsiderate if she's been upfront. The boyfriend's frustration might stem from his own desires not being met, but the author is clear and not pressuring him. The answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because she's communicated her stance and the relationship's sustainability regarding children is a valid concern.\n"
