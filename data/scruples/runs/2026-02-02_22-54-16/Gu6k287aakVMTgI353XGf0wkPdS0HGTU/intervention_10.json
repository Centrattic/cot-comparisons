I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not entertaining the idea of having kids. The author is a woman in her mid-20s, has always known she doesn't want kids, and is in a five-year relationship with a boyfriend who is older. She's been clear about her stance, even telling him to leave if he wants kids. The boyfriend has been making snippy comments about having children, and the author's mother thinks she doesn't love him, despite her saying she does.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has been upfront from the start of the relationship about her stance on kids. That's important because it's a major life decision and people should know if they can't have children. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is bringing up the topic, which suggests he might have different expectations. The author's firmness in her decision to not have kids is clear, and she's even warned him that if he wants kids, he should leave. That shows she's not trying to avoid the issue but is being honest.\n\nNow, the boyfriend's mom is involved, which adds another layer. The mother's opinion might be influencing the boyfriend, but the author's feelings are towards her partner, not his mother. The financial aspect is mentioned as a concern, which is valid because having kids is expensive. The author also mentions wanting dogs instead, indicating her preference for pets over children, which is a personal choice.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a standpoint of personal choice and honesty, she's not doing anything wrong by being clear and consistent. The boyfriend might feel hurt or frustrated, but that's more about his own expectations conflicting with hers. The key here is mutual respect and understanding. If the boyfriend can't accept her stance, then it's his problem, not hers. She's not stringing him along; she's been upfront. Therefore, the answer should be that she's not in the wrong.\n"
