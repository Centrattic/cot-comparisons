I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids. The author is in her mid-20s, has known since 16 that she doesn't want children, and has been upfront with her boyfriend. They've been together over 5 years, he's older. He's making snippy comments about having kids, which she shuts down. She even said if he wants kids, he should leave. The boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she does. They can't afford kids and she wants dogs instead.\n\nHmm. So first, the author is clear from the start about her stance on kids. That's important because it's honest communication in a relationship. The boyfriend is bringing up the topic, which suggests maybe he's not okay with her decision. But she's been upfront, so he should have known this before getting into the relationship. If he's not happy with her decision after five years, maybe the issue is on his side. Also, financial constraints are real, and she's being responsible by not considering kids when they can't afford it. She's prioritizing her wants and values. The mom's opinion is probably not the main issue here. The key is whether her decision is wrong. Since she's made her stance clear and it's a personal choice, I don't think she's in the wrong. The boyfriend might not be respecting her choice, but the author isn't at fault here.\n"
