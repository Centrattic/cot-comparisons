I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario is about not wanting kids and how their boyfriend is pressuring them about it.\n\nFirst, the author has always known they don't want kids since they were 16. They've been with their boyfriend for over five years and have made it clear from the start. They shut down conversations when he brings it up, even telling him to leave if he wants kids. The boyfriend's mom thinks the author doesn't love him, but the author does. They also mention financial reasons and personal preference for dogs over kids.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for not entertaining the idea of having kids. The user thinks the author isn't wrong. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the boyfriend might feel neglected or frustrated if his desires aren't considered. But the author has been consistent in their stance, communicated it clearly, and the relationship is a long-term one. The author also mentions practical reasons like finances. It's important to respect each other's boundaries in a relationship. If both are committed to each other but have conflicting values on having children, it's a tough situation. However, the author isn't forcing the issue; they're standing by their choice. Since they've communicated it upfront and the boyfriend is aware, the author isn't in the wrong. The issue might be more on the boyfriend's side for not respecting her decision. So the answer should be B.\n"
