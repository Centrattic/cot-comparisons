I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting kids and her boyfriend of over five years wanting to discuss the possibility, but she's been shutting down those conversations. She's clear about her stance from a young age and makes sure her partners don't want kids. Now, her boyfriend is older, and he's been getting snippy comments about not having kids. The author has told him if he wants kids, he should leave. Her in-laws might not believe she loves him because of this. She argues they can't afford kids, work full-time, and she wants dogs instead.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. First, the author has been upfront from the start. When dating, she ensures the partner doesn't want kids. That's responsible because it avoids leading someone on. Now, in her current relationship of five years, she's been clear. But the boyfriend is bringing it up, and she's shutting it down. The key here is communication and mutual respect. If both partners can't compromise, that's a problem. But the author is clear about her stance and isn't backing down. The boyfriend might feel his needs aren't being considered, but the author's reasoning is valid\u2014financial constraints, lifestyle, and personal choice. \n\nIn relationships, especially long-term ones, it's crucial that both partners agree on major life decisions like having kids. If one partner is adamant against it, and the other can't accept that, it might lead to conflict. However, the author hasn't been dishonest. She's made her position clear from the start. The boyfriend's snippy comments and her firm response suggest a possible incompatibility. The author isn't in the wrong for holding her ground on something she's never wanted, especially if the boyfriend knew this when they started dating. If he didn't make it a deal-breaker earlier, maybe he should now. But it's also about whether the author is being respectful in her communication. Shutting down the conversation might be seen as dismissive, but if she's been consistent, maybe it's reasonable. Ultimately, it's about mutual agreement and respect. Since the author is clear and the boyfriend is now pushing for kids after five years, the fault isn't entirely on her. She's not changing her stance, so the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
