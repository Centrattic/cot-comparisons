I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The person in question is a woman in her mid-20s in a five-year relationship. She's been clear from a young age that she doesn't want children. She's made sure her past partners were also against having kids to avoid leading anyone on. Now, her current boyfriend, who's older, is bringing up the topic more, and she's been shutting those conversations down. She even told him that if he wants kids, he should leave. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she claims she does. They can't afford kids financially and she prefers getting dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether she's in the wrong. The key points here are her consistency in communicating her stance on having kids, the duration of the relationship, and the boyfriend's reaction. She's been clear from the start and hasn't changed her position. The boyfriend's mom's opinion is mentioned, but the main issue is between the couple. The financial aspect is a valid concern, and her preference for dogs is personal. \n\nIn relationships, especially long-term ones, it's crucial for both partners to align on major life decisions like having children. She's communicated her stance repeatedly, so if the boyfriend is unhappy with that, it's his choice to stay or go. However, pressuring someone about a non-negotiable topic can be a problem. The boyfriend's mom criticizing her might add stress, but that's their family dynamic. \n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong for not entertaining the idea of kids. Since she's been upfront and the boyfriend is now pushing for it despite knowing her position, the issue might lie more with the boyfriend's expectations. The author isn't changing her mind, which isn't necessarily wrong because personal values and preferences shouldn't be compromised just to accommodate a partner's desires. \n\nFinancial instability is another factor; they can't even afford their apartment. Adding kids would be impractical. Her preference for dogs shows she can have other pets, which is a valid choice. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong. She's been clear, and if the boyfriend can't accept that, it's his decision to leave. The problem isn't her for holding her ground but perhaps his inability to accept her as she is.\n"
