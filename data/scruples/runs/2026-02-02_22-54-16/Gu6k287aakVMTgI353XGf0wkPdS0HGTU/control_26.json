I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not wanting kids and the boyfriend being upset about it. The user is a woman in her mid-20s who's been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's known since 16 she didn't want kids, and she's been upfront with her partners about that. Now her boyfriend is giving her snippy comments about having kids, and she's shut down the conversation. She even told him if he wants kids he should leave. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she says she does. They can't afford kids and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, the key points here are her stance on kids, the boyfriend's reaction, and their financial situation. She's been clear about her no-children stance from the start, which is important. She's been honest with her partners, including the current one, so she's not leading him on. The boyfriend, after five years, is still bringing it up. Maybe he hasn't accepted her position, even though she's made it clear. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Well, she's not forcing him to stay; she told him he can leave if he wants kids. That's a strong statement, so maybe she's taking a firm stance here. Her reasons are practical (cost, work, etc.) and personal (preferring dogs). The boyfriend's mom's opinion is mentioned, but that's his family's reaction, not necessarily her fault. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, it's more about whether she's being fair. She's been upfront, so she's not hiding her views. The boyfriend might need to accept that or leave. Since she's given him a choice, maybe she's not in the wrong. The answer would be B (No) because she's being honest and he's the one not respecting her wishes by bringing it up repeatedly.\n"
