I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not entertaining the idea of having kids. The author is a woman in her mid-20s who has always known she doesn't want kids. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years, and he's older. He's made snippy comments about having kids, and she shuts those conversations down. She even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she does. They can't afford kids, and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has made her stance clear from a young age, so it's not a sudden change. She's been upfront with her boyfriend about not wanting kids, which is important in a relationship. Communication is key here. She's been with him for over five years, which suggests a long-term commitment, but maybe they haven't resolved this issue. The boyfriend's comments are \"snippy,\" which might indicate he's unhappy or feels pressured. However, she's firm in her decision and isn't backing down.\n\nFinancial stability is another factor. They can't even afford a small apartment, so having kids would be financially irresponsible. She also mentions wanting dogs, which are a different kind of responsibility but manageable. The boyfriend's mother's opinion is mentioned, but the author's feelings are valid too. The question is whether shutting down the conversation is wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, it's her body and her choice. No one should force someone to have kids. However, in a relationship, differing values can cause conflict. If the boyfriend wants kids and she doesn't, it's a significant issue that needs to be addressed. But since she's been clear from the start and remains consistent, it's hard to say she's in the wrong. The problem might be more on the boyfriend's side for not respecting her boundaries or considering their financial situation. However, the situation is complex because long-term relationships require mutual understanding. If her stance is non-negotiable and he can't accept that, maybe they need to part ways. But the author isn't at fault for holding her ground. So the answer is probably B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
