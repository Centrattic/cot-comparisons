I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids and shutting down the conversation. The author is a woman in her mid-20s in a 5-year relationship. She's been clear from a young age she doesn't want kids, and she's made sure her partners knew that. Her current boyfriend is older and has been giving her snippy comments about having kids. She shuts down the conversation each time and even told him if he wants kids he should leave. The boyfriend's mom thinks the author doesn't love him, but the author says she does. They can't afford kids, and she prefers having dogs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has been upfront about her stance on children from the start. She's been in a long-term relationship, which suggests she's been consistent. The boyfriend's comments are coming up repeatedly, and she's firm in her position. The user is asking if she's in the wrong. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, people have different values. Not wanting children is a personal choice. If she's been clear and the relationship is mutually agreeable, then it's not her fault. However, if the boyfriend feels his needs aren't being respected, that's on him. The author isn't forcing the issue; she's making her position known. The financial aspect is also a real concern, and she's honest about that. The boyfriend's mom's opinion isn't necessarily relevant unless it's causing significant strain.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe she's not considering the boyfriend's feelings enough. But she's made it clear she doesn't want kids, so if he's pushing, that's his issue. The fact that she's been with him for five years suggests they've had time to discuss this. The user mentions that when the topic comes up, she shuts it down, which might be seen as dismissive, but if she's already clear and the conversation is ongoing despite that, maybe it's the boyfriend's persistence that's the problem. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is practical\u2014cost, lifestyle, etc. Those are valid reasons. The boyfriend might want kids, but if she's not willing to compromise, it's a deal-breaker. But the question is about whether she's in the wrong. If both parties are honest about their needs, then no one is necessarily in the wrong. However, the boyfriend's mom's interference complicates things, but that's more about family dynamics than the author's choice.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong because she's been upfront and consistent. The boyfriend's push for kids is his choice, and her stance is based on real reasons. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
