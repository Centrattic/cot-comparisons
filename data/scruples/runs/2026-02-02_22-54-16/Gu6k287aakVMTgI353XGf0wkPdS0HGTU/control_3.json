I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author is a woman in her mid-20s who has never wanted kids and has been upfront with her boyfriend about it. They've been together over five years, and he's older. She shuts down conversations about kids, even telling him to leave if that's what he wants. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she does. They can't afford kids, and she prefers dogs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has been clear about her stance on having kids from a young age. She's made sure her dates knew her position. In this relationship, she's been direct with her boyfriend about not wanting kids. The boyfriend is getting comments about it, and the author is firm. The mother's opinion is mentioned, but it's not the boyfriend's direct stance. The financial aspect is a concern, which is a valid point. Also, she wants pets instead.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user wants a simple A or B answer. \n\nLooking at the situation, the author has been honest throughout. She's not hiding her feelings. The boyfriend is getting snippy comments, but she's firm in her decision. The mother's opinion is a third-party view. The author's reasons are personal and practical. In relationships, differing desires on having children can be a deal-breaker. Since she's been upfront, it's not her fault. The boyfriend might need to decide if he can accept her stance. The author isn't wrong for being honest and not wanting kids. So, answer B.\n"
