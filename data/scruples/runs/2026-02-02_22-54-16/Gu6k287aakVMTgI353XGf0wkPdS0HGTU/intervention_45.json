I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids in a long-term relationship. The author is female in her mid-20s, been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's known since 16 she didn't want kids. She's been upfront with her partners about this. Her current boyfriend is older, and he's been giving her snippy comments about having kids. She shuts down the conversation and even told him that if he wants kids, he should leave. The boyfriend's mom thinks the author doesn't love him, but the author claims she does love him. They can't afford kids and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are her honesty from the start, her clear communication about not wanting kids, and the boyfriend's persistence despite that. She's made it clear she's not interested, and the boyfriend's comments are likely pushing her boundaries. Her stance is that she's not willing to have kids, which is a personal choice. Legally, there's no right or wrong in personal preferences, but ethically, it's about mutual respect in the relationship.\n\nThe boyfriend's mom's opinion is irrelevant unless the boyfriend is being pressured, but the main issue is the boyfriend's reaction. If he respects her choice, he should accept it. However, if he keeps bringing it up and she's firm in her decision, then she's not wrong for upholding her values. The financial argument is valid too; they can't afford kids. Also, she wants pets, which is a personal choice. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because she's communicated her stance from the beginning, and the boyfriend's continued push for kids despite her clear position might indicate he hasn't respected her boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
