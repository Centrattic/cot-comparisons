I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids in her relationship. The situation is that she's been with her boyfriend for over five years, and he's older. She's known since 16 that she doesn't want kids. She's been upfront with all her partners about this. Now her boyfriend is giving her snippy comments about having kids, and she shuts the conversation down. She even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she does. They can't afford kids, and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is wrong. The key points here are about personal choice, communication, and relationship dynamics. The author has been clear about her stance on kids from the beginning. She's made sure to only date people who don't want kids. So, she's not keeping this a secret. That's important because in relationships, especially long-term ones, being upfront about such major life decisions is crucial.\n\nNow, the boyfriend is older and maybe has different expectations. He's bringing up the topic of kids, which the author has already made clear is a non-negotiable for her. She's firm in her position, even to the point of saying he should leave if that's what he wants. That's pretty direct. But is that wrong? Well, if he knew from the start she didn't want kids, then bringing it up now might be an issue. However, people's desires can evolve over time. Maybe he thought they could find a way to make kids work despite the financial strain.\n\nThe financial aspect is a big factor. They can't afford a small apartment, so kids would be unaffordable. That's a valid concern. She also mentions wanting dogs instead, which shows she's not opposed to pets but not kids. But the boyfriend might feel that this is a deal-breaker for him. The boyfriend's mom thinking she doesn't love him is a red flag. It suggests that there's external pressure from his family, which could be affecting their relationship.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? It depends on the expectations in the relationship. If the boyfriend knew from the beginning she didn't want kids, then he might have made a different choice. However, if he's now realizing that he wants kids and the author is unwilling to change her stance, that's a conflict. The author isn't wrong for having her own values, but if the relationship requires compromise on such a fundamental issue, then maybe there's a problem. But the author has been clear, so perhaps it's the boyfriend who's not respecting her boundaries. On the other hand, if the relationship has been going on for five years and he's only now bringing this up with snippy comments, that could indicate he hasn't been fully committed to her stance. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't in the wrong because she's communicated her stance and is being honest. It's the boyfriend who might be at fault for not accepting her boundaries. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
