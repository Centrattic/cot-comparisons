I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting kids and the boyfriend's reactions.\n\nFirst, the author is in her mid-20s and has been clear about not wanting kids since she was 16. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years and has consistently communicated her stance. She shuts down conversations when they come up and even told him he should leave if he wants kids. That seems pretty upfront. She also mentions financial reasons and personal preferences, like wanting dogs instead. \n\nThe boyfriend's family, especially his mom, thinks she doesn't love him because of this. But the author maintains she does love him but can't have kids. The key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author has been clear from the start, which is important in any relationship. If the boyfriend hasn't been able to accept that after five years, maybe the issue is on his side for not respecting her boundaries. \n\nHowever, some might argue that not entertaining the idea at all could be dismissive. But the author isn't just being flippant; she has valid reasons. The boyfriend's mom's judgment might reflect societal pressure rather than the situation itself. The author isn't forcing the issue; she's making a personal choice and stands by it. So, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's been honest and has her reasons, so the answer should be B.\n"
