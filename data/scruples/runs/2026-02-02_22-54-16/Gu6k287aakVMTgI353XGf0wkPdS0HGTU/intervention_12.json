I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is in her mid-20s and has been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's been clear since she was 16 that she doesn't want kids. She's made sure her past partners also didn't want kids to avoid stringing them along. Her current boyfriend is older, and he's been making snippy comments about having kids. She shuts down those conversations and even told him that if he wants kids, he should leave. The boyfriend's mom thinks the author doesn't love him, but she says she does. They can't afford kids and she wants dogs instead.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong and asks for my opinion. I need to decide if the answer is A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the author has been upfront about her stance on kids from the start of her relationships. That's important because compatibility on such a major issue is crucial. Her boyfriend has been making comments, but she's been clear about her position. She even set a firm boundary by saying if he wants kids, he should leave. That shows she's serious about her decision.\n\nThe boyfriend's mom is involved, which might add pressure, but the author isn't the one who changed her stance. The financial situation is another factor; they can't afford kids, which is a valid concern. The author's reasons (cost, workload, wanting dogs instead) are personal choices that don't harm others. \n\nIn relationships, especially long-term ones, differing views on kids can be deal-breakers. The author isn't forcing the issue on her boyfriend, but she's also not compromising. Since she's been transparent and consistent, it's reasonable for her to walk away if he can't accept her stance. The boyfriend might need to consider if he can accept her decision or if it's a deal-breaker for him. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is being honest and upfront. Since she is, and she's made it clear from the start, she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend might be the one in the wrong if he's not respecting her boundaries. So, the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
