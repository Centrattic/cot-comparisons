I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting kids and shutting down the conversation about it in their long-term relationship.\n\nFirst, the author is in her mid-20s, has been with her boyfriend for over five years, and has always been clear about not wanting kids. She's made sure past partners knew this, which shows she's been upfront from the start. That's a key point\u2014being honest about her stance. \n\nHer boyfriend is older and has been making snippy comments about kids. The author responds by shutting down the conversation each time, even telling him to leave if that's what he wants. The boyfriend's mom is involved, suggesting he's pushing for kids, but the author's reasons are practical: financial instability, wanting dogs instead, and the general burden of kids. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The main factors here are communication and mutual respect. The author has been clear about her no-children stance from the beginning, which is responsible. However, in a long-term relationship, constant pushback without considering compromise could strain things. But since she's made her position known and the boyfriend is now pressing for kids, maybe he didn't take her stance seriously enough earlier. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong if she's not engaging in the discussion at all, but she's explaining her reasons (financial, workload). Still, in a relationship, some level of compromise is expected. However, if having kids is a deal-breaker for her, it's her right to set that boundary. The boyfriend might need to accept that or realize it's not compatible. The author's firmness could be justified if she's been consistent, but maybe she could have a more open dialogue instead of shutting it down. Yet, given her clear communication from the start, she's not necessarily in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
