I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, a woman in her mid-20s, who has known since 16 that she doesn't want kids. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years, and he's been making snippy comments about having kids. She shuts down the conversation each time and even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but the author does, and they can't afford kids financially.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The question is whether her stance on not having kids, and her responses to her boyfriend's comments, make her the asshole.\n\nThe key points here are: She's been clear about not wanting kids from the start, made sure her partners knew, and is upfront with her current boyfriend. She's in a long-term relationship, over five years, which suggests they've been together a while. The boyfriend is older, which might mean he has different expectations. She's firm in her decision, even telling him to leave if he wants kids. Financial constraints are a real issue, and she wants a dog instead of a child.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author has communicated her stance clearly, so she's not keeping it a secret. The boyfriend's mom's opinion is mentioned, but that's probably not the main issue here. The boyfriend's feelings are important, but if he hasn't respected her boundaries, maybe he's the one in the wrong. However, if the boyfriend is genuinely unhappy or the situation is causing significant conflict, that could play a role.\n\nBut the author isn't forcing him to stay; she's given him a clear choice. While it's harsh to tell someone to leave, it's also honest. If the boyfriend knew from the start or over five years that she didn't want kids and still chose to stay, maybe he's at fault for not addressing it earlier. On the other hand, if he's been making snippy comments, that's also not respectful. The author's firmness might be justified, especially if she's been consistent. Financial reasons are valid, and wanting a dog isn't inherently wrong. So the author's position seems justified. The answer is likely B (No).\n"
