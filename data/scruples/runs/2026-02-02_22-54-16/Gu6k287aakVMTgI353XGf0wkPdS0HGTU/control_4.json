I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The key points from the scenario are:\n\n1. The author is a woman in her mid-20s who has been certain about not wanting children since she was 16.\n2. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years, and he's older. He's made snippy comments about having kids, which she shuts down.\n3. She's clear about her stance, even telling him to leave if that's what he wants.\n4. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but the author insists she does.\n5. They can't afford children financially, both work full-time, and she wants a dog instead of a lifelong responsibility.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if her actions are wrong. The main ethical considerations here are autonomy, communication, and mutual respect in a relationship.\n\nAutonomy: The author has the right to make decisions about her own body and future. Not wanting children is a personal choice, and she's been consistent about it for years. That's her autonomous decision, which is a strong point in her favor.\n\nCommunication: She mentions that she's been upfront with her boyfriend about not wanting kids. She's made sure past partners knew this before getting into relationships, which shows she's proactive about communication. However, the boyfriend's comments are \"snippy,\" which might indicate he's not approaching the topic constructively. The author shutting down the conversation could be a way to avoid conflict, but if he's continuing to bring it up, maybe there's a breakdown in communication on his part as well.\n\nMutual Respect: The boyfriend's family (his mom) disapproves, but the author's decision isn't about him; it's her choice. If he truly respects her, he should accept her decision. However, if he feels disrespected by her stance, that's another layer. The author's response of telling him to leave if kids are important to him is a clear boundary, which can be seen as responsible because she's not stringing him along.\n\nFinancial and Lifestyle Factors: They can't afford children, and she wants a dog instead. These are practical reasons that support her decision. It's reasonable to consider financial stability when deciding to have children. Her preference for a dog doesn't negate her love but highlights differing priorities.\n\nPotential Issues: The question is whether her actions are wrong. If she's been honest from the start and the relationship is still ongoing despite his objections, maybe the issue is on his side. But if he hasn't accepted her stance and continues to push, that's his problem. However, the author's firm stance could be seen as inflexible, but given her long-held belief, it's more about staying true to herself.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong because she's clear, consistent, and has valid reasons. The boyfriend's mom's judgment doesn't make her wrong; people have different values. The financial aspect is a practical reason, not a moral one. Her choice to prioritize her own desires (a dog) over children is personal and doesn't harm others.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. Her decisions are based on personal values, financial reality, and clear communication. The boyfriend's dissatisfaction or his mom's disapproval doesn't validate that she's wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
