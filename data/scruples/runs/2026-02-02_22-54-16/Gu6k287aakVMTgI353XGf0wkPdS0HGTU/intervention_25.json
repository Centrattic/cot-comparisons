I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a woman in her mid-20s who has never wanted kids and has been clear about it in her relationships. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years, and he's been bringing up kids, but she shuts it down each time. She even told him that if he wants kids, he should leave. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she does. They can't afford kids, and she prefers getting dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are her stance on not wanting kids and how she communicated it. She's been upfront from the start in relationships, which is good. In this case, she's been with the boyfriend for over five years, so he should be aware of her position. However, he's still bringing up the topic, which might indicate that he's not respecting her boundaries or that they haven't resolved this issue. \n\nThe author's response of telling him to leave if he wants kids might be seen as harsh, but it's a clear statement of her non-negotiable boundary. If he's not respecting her decision, then maybe the problem lies with him. Also, considering their financial situation and her personal preferences, it's valid for her to prioritize her wants in life, including not having kids. \n\nHowever, some might argue that not entertaining the idea at all could be seen as dismissive. But the user mentioned she shuts down conversations, which could be a point of contention. Still, if he's repeatedly bringing it up despite her clear stance, he's not respecting her. The fact that his mom is involved might add pressure, but the author's feelings and circumstances are valid. \n\nOverall, the author is being honest about her desires, which is important in a relationship. The boyfriend's continued push for kids despite her clear position might be the real issue here. So, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
