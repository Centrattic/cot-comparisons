I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for not wanting kids and shutting down conversations about it.\n\nFirst, the author has been clear from a young age that she doesn't want children. She made sure her partners knew this before dating them, which seems responsible. Now, after five years with her boyfriend, he's older, and she's been getting snippy comments about having kids. She shuts down the conversation and even told him if he wants kids he should leave. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but the author insists she does. They can't afford kids, both work full-time, and she prefers dogs instead.\n\nSo, the key points here are her long-standing decision, being upfront with partners, financial reasons, and her preference. I need to consider if she's wrong for holding to her decision despite the boyfriend's wishes. Legally and ethically, people have the right to choose whether to have children. She\u2019s not pressuring him into anything; in fact, she's making it clear. His mom's opinion isn't a strong argument against her being in the wrong. The fact that they can't afford kids adds another layer, but the main issue is mutual respect of each other's choices. If the boyfriend respects her decision, then she's not in the wrong. But if he's unhappy and she's not considering compromise, maybe there's a tension. However, she's not the one wanting kids; she's the one who's firm on her stance. The question is whether she's wrong for not entertaining the idea. From what's given, she's been consistent and upfront. So the answer leans towards B, No.\n"
