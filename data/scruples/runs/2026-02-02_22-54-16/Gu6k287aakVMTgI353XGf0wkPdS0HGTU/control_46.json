I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids in their relationship. The author is a woman in her mid-20s in a 5-year relationship with a boyfriend older than her. She's been clear about not wanting kids since 16, and she's only dated people who also didn't want kids. But now her boyfriend is making snippy comments about having kids, and she shut it down, saying he should leave if that's what he wants. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she insists she does.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation. The author has been upfront about her stance on kids from the start. She's made sure her partners don't want kids either. That shows she's been honest and considerate. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is bringing up the topic now after five years, which might indicate he didn't discuss his future family plans earlier. The author is firm in her decision, and her reasons are valid: financial constraints, wanting dogs instead, and the general responsibility of kids.\n\nThe boyfriend's mom's opinion that the author doesn't love him is a red flag. The mother's judgment could be adding pressure on the boyfriend, but the author's feelings are her own. The key here is whether the author is wrong for not entertaining the idea. Since she's been consistent and clear, and the boyfriend is only now raising issues, it seems the problem is on his side for not addressing his desires earlier. The author isn't wrong for standing by her decision, especially given her reasons and the timing of the boyfriend's comments. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
