I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone who doesn't want kids and is in a long-term relationship where the partner is pushing for having children. The author has been clear about their stance from a young age and has only dated people who also don't want kids. Now, after five years with her boyfriend, he's making comments about having kids, and she shuts down the conversation. Her reasoning includes financial issues, the workload of kids, and preferring dogs instead. The question is whether she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has been upfront about her views on having children from the start. That's important because it shows she's not hiding her preferences, which is a responsible approach in relationships. She's made sure past partners were aligned with her on this, which suggests she values compatibility in this aspect. Now, with her current boyfriend, he's bringing up the topic, which might indicate he's not on the same page, despite being in a five-year relationship. \n\nThe author's response is firm, telling him to leave if he wants kids. That's a strong statement, but given that she's been clear about her stance from the beginning, maybe she's justified in setting that boundary. The boyfriend's comments might be a red flag if he hasn't respected her position over the years. The fact that his mom thinks she doesn't love him adds another layer, possibly indicating family pressure or miscommunication.\n\nFinancial stability is another factor. The couple can't even afford their small apartment, making the idea of having kids impractical. The author's argument that having kids is expensive and not feasible right now is a valid concern. Also, wanting dogs instead of kids might not be a direct issue but gives insight into her priorities.\n\nI should also think about relationship dynamics. If the boyfriend hasn't addressed this issue constructively and is making snippy comments, it might show he's not respecting her boundaries. Healthy relationships require mutual respect, and if he's pushing for something she's firmly against, that could be the problem. The author's stance seems consistent and clear, so it's the boyfriend who might be at fault for not respecting her decision or not being on the same page.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that after five years, the author should be more open to discussion or compromise. But given her long-standing position and the impracticality of having kids financially, it's reasonable for her to maintain her stance. The boyfriend's frustration might stem from unmet expectations, but if he knew from the start she didn't want kids, he should have considered that before entering the relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because she's been transparent and the boyfriend hasn't respected her boundaries. The responsibility lies with him for not aligning with her views on having children.\n"
