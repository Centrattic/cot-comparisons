I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to have kids and shutting down conversations about it in a long-term relationship. The author is a woman in her mid-20s who's known since 16 she doesn't want kids. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years, and he's older. He's been making snippy comments about having kids, and she's been shutting it down. She even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she claims she does. They can't afford kids, work full-time, and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has been clear about her stance on not wanting kids from the start. She's made sure her partners don't want kids to avoid hurting them. In this current relationship, she's communicated her position, and the boyfriend is still bringing it up. She's direct and firm, even telling him to leave if that's what he wants. The question is whether that's wrong.\n\nFrom a general standpoint, people have different values and life choices. Not wanting children is a personal decision, and it's important for both partners to align on major life decisions. The author has been upfront and consistent. If the boyfriend hasn't accepted that after five years, maybe there's a communication issue. However, it's also important to consider if the author is being disrespectful or dismissive. She says she shuts down the conversation and told him to leave if he wants kids. That could be seen as not being open to dialogue, which might be problematic in a relationship. But she's standing by her values and not pretending to change her mind.\n\nFinancial stability is another factor. They can't afford kids, which is a valid concern. Wanting dogs instead shows her preference for different responsibilities. The boyfriend's mom's opinion might be irrelevant unless it's causing significant conflict, but the main issue is between the couple.\n\nIn relationships, both parties should respect each other's boundaries. If the boyfriend is pressuring her for something she's firmly against, that's a red flag. But the author's approach could be seen as not being collaborative. Maybe a middle ground or discussing why he wants kids could help. However, the author is clear she won't budge. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If she's been honest and he's still pushing, maybe he's not respecting her decision. But her response of saying he should leave might be too harsh. It's a balance between respecting each other's values and maintaining the relationship. The answer likely depends on cultural and personal values. In many cases, it's not wrong to hold firm on such a significant decision, especially when communicated clearly. Therefore, the answer might be B (No).\n"
