I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids in their relationship. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe author is a woman in her mid-20s who's been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's been firm about not wanting kids since she was 16. She's made sure her partners share her views to avoid hurting them later. Her boyfriend, who's older, has been giving snippy comments about having kids. She shuts down the conversation and even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. The boyfriend's mom thinks the author doesn't love him, but the author insists she does. They can't afford kids, even with their small apartment, and she prefers having dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has been clear from the start about her stance on children. That's important because it shows she's not being deceptive. She's been upfront, which is a responsible approach. Relationships require mutual compatibility in major life decisions, like having kids. If one person is adamant about not having kids, it's reasonable for the other to consider whether they can accept that.\n\nThe boyfriend's mom is involved, which adds another layer. The mother's opinion might be influencing him, leading to pressure on the author. However, the author's feelings and circumstances are valid. She mentions financial constraints and not wanting the responsibility. These are legitimate reasons. People have different values, and wanting children is a significant commitment that affects many aspects of life.\n\nThe author's response when the topic comes up is firm. Telling the boyfriend to leave if he wants kids is a strong statement, but given the length of the relationship and her consistent stance, it's understandable. She's not stringing him along; she's been clear. It's possible that the boyfriend hasn't respected her boundaries, leading to tension. However, the author isn't at fault for maintaining her position.\n\nAnother angle is the boyfriend's reaction. If he's been making snippy comments, it's his way of expressing dissatisfaction. But he should have considered her stance when entering the relationship. The author isn't obligated to change her views for him. Relationships should be built on mutual respect for each other's values.\n\nFinancial inability is another factor. They can't afford even a small apartment, so having kids would be unreasonable. This adds weight to her argument that it's not feasible. People should be realistic about their circumstances when discussing major life decisions.\n\nThe mention of wanting dogs instead shows she's not opposed to commitment or responsibility, just the specific commitment of children. It's a personal choice that doesn't harm others. The mother's belief that the author doesn't love her son is a projection and not based on the author's actions described.\n\nIn summary, the author has been transparent, the decision is based on valid reasons, and relationships should align on such significant issues. The boyfriend might be in the wrong for not respecting her decision and their financial reality. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
