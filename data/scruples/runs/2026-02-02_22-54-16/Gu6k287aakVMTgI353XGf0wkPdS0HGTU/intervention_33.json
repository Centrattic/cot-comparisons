I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting kids and shutting down conversations about it in a long-term relationship.\n\nFirst, the author has known since 16 that they don't want kids. That's a long time to have a clear stance. They also mention that in past relationships, they made sure partners also didn't want kids to avoid issues. Now, with a 5-year boyfriend, he's bringing it up and she's shutting it down. She even told him to leave if that's what he wants. The boyfriend's mom is involved, thinking the author doesn't love him. The author argues they can't afford kids, both work full-time, and they prefer dogs over kids.\n\nSo, the key points are: she's been clear about her stance for years, communicates it upfront, and the conflict arises when the boyfriend is pushing for kids. The user thinks she's not wrong, but wants validation.\n\nIn relationships, communication about major life decisions like having kids is crucial. The author has been upfront and consistent. The boyfriend might be unhappy, but if he didn't know her stance earlier, maybe he didn't ask enough. However, after 5 years, he should be aware. The author isn't pressuring him; she's just setting boundaries. The mom's judgment isn't relevant here. The author's reasons (financial, lifestyle) are valid. So, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
