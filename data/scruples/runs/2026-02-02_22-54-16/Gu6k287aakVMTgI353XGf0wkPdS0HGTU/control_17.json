I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids and shutting down conversations about it in her long-term relationship.\n\nFirst, the author made it clear from a young age that she doesn't want children. She's been upfront with her partners about this, which is important. In her current relationship, she's been with her boyfriend for over five years and has consistently communicated her stance. She even mentions that she doesn't want to string anyone along, showing she's considerate of others' feelings.\n\nHer boyfriend is older and has made snippy comments about having kids. Each time the topic comes up, she shuts it down. She once told him if he wants kids, he should leave, which is a firm stance. The boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him because of this, but the author maintains she does love him, just not in the way that includes having children. They also can't afford kids financially, which adds another layer of practical consideration.\n\nI need to consider societal expectations and relationship dynamics. In many cases, having children is a significant life decision. If one partner is firmly against it, the other must respect that or face the possibility of the relationship ending. The author isn't forcing the issue; she's making her position clear and not compromising. Her reasoning includes personal choice, financial constraints, and lifestyle preferences (like wanting dogs instead of children). \n\nHowever, the boyfriend's family's opinion (especially his mom's) is mentioned, which might indicate some external pressure. But the key here is mutual respect and communication. The author has been clear about her boundaries, and if the boyfriend is unhappy with that, it's his choice to stay or leave. She's not using manipulation or deceit; she's honest from the start.\n\nIn relationships, both partners must have compatible life goals. If the boyfriend can't accept her no-children stance, then the relationship's future is uncertain. The author is standing by her decision, which is a valid personal choice. There's no indication she's wrong in this scenario. She's acting in accordance with her values and has communicated them clearly. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
