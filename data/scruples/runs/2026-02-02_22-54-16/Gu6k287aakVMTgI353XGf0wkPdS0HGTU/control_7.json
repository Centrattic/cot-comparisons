I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is in a 5-year relationship and has consistently made it clear since before dating that she doesn't want kids. Her boyfriend is older, and he's been making snippy comments about having kids. The author shuts down those conversations and even told him to leave if he wants kids. The boyfriend's mom thinks the author doesn't love him, but she does. They can't afford kids, and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal choice and autonomy. The author has been upfront about her stance on not wanting children. It's a personal decision, and she's been consistent. The boyfriend is now pushing for kids despite this, even after five years. That suggests he may not have respected her boundaries or considered her non-negotiables when entering the relationship. \n\nFinancial stability is a common argument against having children. The author mentions they can't afford a small apartment and a child. That's a valid concern. Also, wanting dogs instead of children is her personal preference, which is another aspect of her lifestyle choice. \n\nThe boyfriend's mother's opinion that she doesn't love him might be a red herring. Love can exist without sharing the same views on having children. The key is mutual respect for each other's values. If the author has been clear all along and the boyfriend is now pressuring her, that's a problem. \n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners are on the same page about major life decisions like having kids. The author made her position known from the start, so the boyfriend should have considered that before committing to a long-term relationship. If he's unhappy with that, maybe the issue is his inability to accept her boundaries rather than the author being in the wrong. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because she's been honest and consistent. The boyfriend might need to reevaluate whether he can accept her stance. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
