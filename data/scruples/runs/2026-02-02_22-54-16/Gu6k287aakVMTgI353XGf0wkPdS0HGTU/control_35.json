I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids in her relationship. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author is in her mid-20s, has always known she doesn't want children since 16, and has been upfront with her dates about it. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years. He's older, and he's been making snippy comments about having kids. She shuts down the conversation each time, even telling him to leave if that's what he wants. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she insists she does.Financially, they can't afford kids, and she prefers dogs over children.\n\nSo, the key points are: she's been clear from the start about her stance on kids, the relationship is long-term, and her partner is still bringing it up. She's firm in her decision. Now, is she in the wrong?\n\nWell, people have different values. Some might think that if someone is in a long-term relationship, they should be open to compromise, even if it's a major life decision like having kids. Others might say that if she's been consistent and honest, it's his issue for not respecting her boundaries. \n\nHer being upfront is a strong point. If she's always been clear, she's not stringing him along. But maybe he expected her to reconsider over time? However, she's been consistent for years. Also, financial reasons and personal preferences are valid. \n\nOn the flip side, relationships require mutual respect. If he's bringing up the topic in a snippy way, maybe he's not respecting her stance. But if he truly wants kids and she doesn't, that's a fundamental difference. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. If she's honest and he's not happy with that, the fault might lie with him for not accepting her values. So the answer is probably B, she's not in the wrong. But I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. Like, maybe if she never discussed it with him directly, but the post says she does shut down the conversation. So she's making her position clear. Therefore, she's not being unfair. So answer B.\n"
