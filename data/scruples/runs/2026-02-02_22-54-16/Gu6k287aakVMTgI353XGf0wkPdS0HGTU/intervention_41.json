I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, a woman in her mid-20s, who has never wanted kids and has been upfront with her partner about it. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years and he's older. He's been making snippy comments about having kids, but she's shut those conversations down and even told him to leave if that's what he wants. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she does. They can't afford kids, and she prefers dogs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication, honesty, and mutual respect. The author made her stance clear from the start of the relationship, which is important. She's been consistent in not entertaining the idea of kids, which shows she's respected her own values and communicated them. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend is bringing up the topic, which could be part of normal relationship discussions about the future. However, he might feel his needs aren't being met if he wants children and she's unwilling to compromise. The question is whether she's wrong for not changing her stance or for not trying to find a middle ground. \n\nBut in relationships, people have different non-negotiables. If both parties are aware of each other's values from the start, it's not necessarily wrong for one to stick to their guns. The boyfriend's mother's opinion doesn't make the author wrong either. Financial reasons and personal desires (like wanting dogs) are valid factors. \n\nThe author hasn't led the boyfriend on; she's been clear. The boyfriend's comments could be seen as trying to push her, which might not be healthy. So, the author isn't in the wrong for being honest and holding her ground. The answer is B.\n"
