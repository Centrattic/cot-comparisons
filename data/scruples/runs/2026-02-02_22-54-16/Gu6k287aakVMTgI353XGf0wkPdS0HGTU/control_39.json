I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting kids in her relationship.\n\nFirst, the key points: She's in her mid-20s, has known since 16 that she doesn't want kids. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years. He's older. She's been clear about her stance on kids, but he's making snippy comments about having them. She's shut down those conversations and even told him to leave if that's what he wants. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she maintains she does. They can't afford kids, and she prefers dogs instead of a lifelong responsibility.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI think the main factors here are her communication and his reaction. She's been upfront about her stance since the beginning of the relationship. That's important because compatibility on such a major life decision is crucial. He's known her position for years, yet he's still bringing up the topic and making snippy comments. That could indicate he hasn't respected her boundaries. Also, she's made it clear that if he wants kids, he should leave. That's a strong statement, but maybe justified given the long-standing disagreement.\n\nFinancial reasons are a valid concern for not having kids. They can't afford even a small apartment, let alone a child. Her wanting dogs instead of kids shows different priorities, which are personal choices. The boyfriend's mom's opinion that she doesn't love him might be a projection from the mother, not necessarily a reflection of reality. Love doesn't inherently require wanting children, especially if it's a fundamental personal value.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's communicated her stance clearly, and the issue seems to be on her boyfriend for not respecting her boundaries or understanding her reasons. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
