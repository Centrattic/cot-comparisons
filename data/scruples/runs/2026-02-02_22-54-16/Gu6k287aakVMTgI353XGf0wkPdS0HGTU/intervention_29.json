I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA story is in the wrong. The story is about a woman in her mid-20s who's been in a relationship for over five years and has consistently told her boyfriend she doesn't want kids. Now, he's giving her snippy comments about having children, and she's threatening to end the relationship if he insists. The author's mom is involved, thinking the author doesn't love him, but the author says she does. The arguments given are about the cost, work, and that the author prefers dogs.\n\nFirst, I need to remember that AITA questions often want a quick judgment. The user already thinks she's not in the wrong, but they want to know my take. Let's break it down.\n\nThe author has known since 16 she didn't want kids. That's a long time, so her stance is pretty firm. She's been upfront with all her dates about this, which shows she's honest and trying to avoid leading people on. That's a good point in her favor. With a five-year relationship, it's a significant duration. If the boyfriend's not wanting kids hasn't been a dealbreaker for him until now, maybe he's been in denial or not fully considering it. But the author hasn't changed her mind. \n\nThe boyfriend is older, which sometimes means he has different life priorities. He might be wanting kids and feels the author isn't meeting his expectations. The author is shutting down the conversation each time he brings it up, which could be frustrating for him. The comment that if he wants kids he should leave is strong, but she's been clear for a long time. \n\nFinancial issues are mentioned as a reason. The apartment is already a financial strain, so adding kids would be even harder. The author also prefers dogs, which are a lighter commitment. It's reasonable to consider financial stability and personal preferences when making such a big life decision. \n\nThe mom's opinion is that the author doesn't love the boyfriend, but the author says she does. The mom's perspective is common, often thinking that not having kids equates to not truly loving someone. But the author's actions and communication show her commitment to the relationship with the conditions she's set. \n\nSo, the author has consistently communicated her stance, which is a key factor. If the boyfriend knew from the start and is now pushing, maybe he's not respecting her boundaries. However, long-term relationships can change people's needs and expectations. If the boyfriend has valid reasons for wanting kids now and the author is being inflexible, there could be a conflict. But the author is firm in her decision based on personal and practical reasons. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because she's been clear and consistent. The boyfriend might be the one who didn't realize this was a dealbreaker. Also, financial reasons are a legitimate concern. So the answer is B.\n"
