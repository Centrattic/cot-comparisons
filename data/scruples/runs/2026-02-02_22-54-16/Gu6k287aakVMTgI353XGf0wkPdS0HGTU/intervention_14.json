I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids. The situation is that the author has been clear about not wanting children for a long time, even before dating their boyfriend. They've been together over five years and have consistently shut down conversations about kids. The boyfriend is older, and his mom thinks the author doesn't love him because of this. The author mentions financial reasons and personal preferences (wanting dogs instead of kids).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author made their stance clear from the start, so there's no sudden change. The boyfriend has been with her for a long time, which suggests he's had ample opportunity to process this. The author isn't stringing people along; they only date people who don't want kids. The boyfriend's mom's opinion is part of the issue, but the main question is between the author and her boyfriend.\n\nThe author's reasoning includes financial constraints and personal choice. She's being upfront, which is important in relationships. The boyfriend's snippy comments and her firm response (saying he should leave if he wants kids) indicate a potential conflict in values. If the boyfriend can't accept her stance after five years, that's on him. However, the author might be inconsiderate if she's not addressing his feelings, but she's been consistent.\n\nIn terms of ethics, people have the right to make personal choices, especially about having children. As long as she's being honest and not misleading him, she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's issue is with her choice, which isn't her responsibility. The answer should be B (No).\n"
