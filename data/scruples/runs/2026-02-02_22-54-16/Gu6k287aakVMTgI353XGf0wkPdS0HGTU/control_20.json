I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not entertaining the idea of having kids. The author is a woman in her mid-20s in a 5-year relationship. She's been clear about not wanting kids since she was 16. She's made sure her partners know this and only dates people who don't want kids. Now her boyfriend, who is older, is giving her snippy comments about having kids. She shut down the conversation and told him to leave if that's what he wants.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has been upfront about her stance on children. She's been consistent in choosing partners who don't want kids. She's in a long-term relationship and has communicated her position clearly. The boyfriend is now upset, and his mother thinks she doesn't love him, but the author does love him, just not in the context of having kids. They can't afford kids, and she prefers having dogs.\n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, personal choice in reproductive decisions is a fundamental right. The author hasn't forced anyone to change their views but has been honest. The boyfriend's frustration comes from unmet expectations, but he should have known this from the start. If he wasn't clear about his needs or didn't respect her boundaries, that's on him. The author isn't wrong for sticking to her values, especially when she's communicated them clearly. The wrong here might lie more with the boyfriend for not respecting her choice or with his mother for misunderstanding the situation. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
