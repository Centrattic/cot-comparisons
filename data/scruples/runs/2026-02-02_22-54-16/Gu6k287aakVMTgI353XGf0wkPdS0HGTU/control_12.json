I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (a woman in her mid-20s) is in the wrong for not wanting kids and shutting down conversations about it in her long-term relationship.\n\nFirst, the author made her stance clear from a young age. She's been upfront with her boyfriends, including her current one, about not wanting children. She's in a relationship for over five years, and her boyfriend is older. He's bringing up the topic repeatedly, and she shuts it down each time. She even told him he should leave if he wants kids, which is pretty firm.\n\nThe key points are: she's transparent about her no-kids stance, the relationship has been ongoing for a significant time, and there's a mismatch in their desires. The boyfriend is pushing for kids despite her clear position, which might indicate he didn't consider her views before committing. The author's argument is that their financial situation isn't stable, and she prefers pets over children. \n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, mutual respect for each other's values is important. If she's been honest all along and he's still in the relationship, maybe the issue is his expectations rather than her position. However, the fact that he continues to bring it up could be a sign of disrespect for her boundaries. But the user is asking if she's in the wrong. \n\nHer choice isn't immoral; it's a personal decision. However, the way she shut down the conversation and told him to leave might be seen as abrupt. But given that she's been consistent and upfront, it's more about communication style than being wrong. The boyfriend might need to reevaluate if he can accept her decision, especially after five years. The mother's opinion that the author doesn't love him is a red herring\u2014love doesn't have to include wanting kids. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No). The author isn't in the wrong for sticking to her choice after clear communication. The boyfriend and his mother are misjudging her stance.\n"
