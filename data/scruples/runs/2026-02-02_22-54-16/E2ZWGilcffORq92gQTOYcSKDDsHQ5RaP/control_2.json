Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the parent saw their disabled daughter (with cerebral palsy) not being included in a game by other kids. The parent then yelled at the mother of those kids, asking if she was embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid and made other comments. The kids eventually included the daughter later.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. Their daughter wants to play, but the other kids aren't including her. As a parent, they might feel protective and frustrated. Maybe they didn't know how to approach the situation without causing conflict, so they reacted strongly. But yelling at another parent in front of their kids could be seen as confrontational and unkind, even if the intention was to protect their child.\n\nOn the other hand, the kids might not have intended to exclude the daughter. Maybe they didn't know how to include her due to her disability, or they didn't realize she wanted to join. The parent of the daughter might have been right to point out the exclusion, but the method of yelling could have been inappropriate. The mother's response of storming off and slamming the door might have been hurtful. \n\nAlso, the daughter did eventually get included after the incident. So maybe the parent's yelling led to a positive outcome, but the approach was harsh. However, sometimes in the heat of the moment, people react emotionally. The partner thinks they overreacted, which is a sign that maybe the response was too strong. But the parent's concern for their child's inclusion is valid.\n\nI need to check if there's a better way to handle such a situation. Maybe approaching the mother calmly to discuss inclusion would have been better than yelling. Yelling could have made the mother defensive and less likely to include the daughter. The parent's words might have been hurtful, but the underlying issue of inclusion is important.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? They had a valid concern but handled it poorly. Yelling is not a good approach, so the answer might be A (they are in the wrong). However, if the exclusion was intentional, maybe the parent had reason to be upset. But since it's unclear if the exclusion was intentional, the parent's reaction of yelling was probably excessive. Hence, AITA would lean towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
