Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the other kids' mom was wrong. The situation involves a disabled daughter who wasn't included in play. The parent yelled at the other mother, accusing her of being embarrassed. Then after the kids included their daughter, the parent says the other mom left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The parent's goal was to make sure their daughter wasn't excluded. That's understandable, especially since the daughter has a disability. But the method they used was yelling, which might be seen as aggressive. However, defending their child's social inclusion is a strong motivator.\n\nNext, the other mother's reaction. She didn't respond, which could imply she felt defensive or guilty. But maybe she was just shocked. The daughter ended up being included later, so the outcome was positive. However, the initial approach was confrontational. \n\nIs yelling justified? Well, the parent felt their child was being left out, which can be hurtful. But confronting the other parent publicly might have been harsh. Maybe a more diplomatic approach, like talking to the mother privately, could have been better. But the parent's intent was to protect their child's feelings.\n\nAlso, the daughter's reaction\u2014moving closer then later joining in after the confrontation\u2014suggests that the mother's actions might have encouraged inclusion. But the parent's partner thinks they overreacted, which adds another perspective.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The parent acted to protect their child from exclusion, which is a valid concern. However, the method of public confrontation and yelling could be seen as overstepping. So, the answer might depend on whether the means justified the ends. But since the daughter was eventually included, maybe the parent's actions were a reaction to a real issue. However, yelling is often considered an overreaction. So, the answer could be AITA for overreacting, but not entirely wrong.\n\nWait, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If I choose A (yes), that would mean they're at fault for yelling. Choosing B (no) would mean they're not. Considering the intent to protect their child, maybe the author isn't wrong. But public yelling is usually frowned upon. Hmm. I think it's a tough call. However, in many AITA scenarios, public shaming or yelling is seen as problematic. So the answer might lean towards A, but given the context of advocating for their disabled child, perhaps not. The community might have mixed reactions. But the key is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's action was to address their daughter's exclusion, perhaps they're not in the wrong. But yelling is still considered wrong. Maybe the answer is AITA, meaning they are at fault, so answer A. But I'm a bit conflicted here. The parent's intent was good, but the method was poor. So the answer is A, yes, they're in the wrong.\n"
