Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for yelling at the kids and their mom for not including their disabled daughter. So the question is whether the author's reaction was justified.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's daughter is disabled, specifically with cerebral palsy. She was sitting outside watching two kids playing ball. The author noticed that the kids weren't including her and then yelled at the mother, asking if she was embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. The mother didn't respond, and the author continued by saying it's just cerebral palsy and that she isn't poisonous. The daughter eventually got included later.\n\nThe main points here are the author's intent to protect their daughter and ensure she's included. But yelling might be seen as confrontational. The mother might have been unaware of the situation or felt that her children were being rude. However, the author's approach was to confront the mother directly, which could have been a shock to her. The daughter ended up getting included eventually, so maybe the author's actions had a positive outcome in the end.\n\nBut was yelling the right approach? Arguably, the author was acting out of concern for their child's social inclusion and feelings. The daughter might feel left out, which is important to address. However, yelling at the mother could be seen as aggressive and might have made the mother defensive instead of addressing the children's behavior. The mother might not have realized her children weren't including the author's daughter, or she might have been in a position where she couldn't intervene immediately.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's daughter has a disability, and inclusion is crucial. The author might feel that their child is being excluded due to her disability, which is a valid concern. The author's approach might have been a way to confront the issue directly to ensure inclusion, even if it was done in a loud manner.\n\nBut there's a difference between standing up for one's child and being confrontational. Yelling could have been inappropriate, especially in a public setting. Maybe a more constructive approach would have been to talk to the mother calmly, explain the situation, and ask for the children to include the daughter. However, the author felt the need to act quickly, possibly because they saw their daughter being excluded and wanted to address it immediately.\n\nAlso, the daughter eventually did get included, so maybe the author's yelling had the desired effect. But the mother's reaction was to storm off, which might indicate that the approach was too harsh. The partner also thinks the author overreacted, suggesting that there's a perspective that yelling was unnecessary.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author's action was motivated by a desire to protect and include their child. However, the method might not have been the best. The key is whether the author's actions were justified given the context. If the mother was unaware of the exclusion, yelling might not have been the most effective way to address the issue. Alternatively, if the author felt that a calm approach would not have worked, they might feel justified.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might depend on whether yelling was the appropriate method to address the exclusion. The author's intent was good, but the method could be questioned. However, the situation is complex, and different people might have different opinions. Since the user is asking for a judgment as to whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would balance the intent against the method used.\n"
