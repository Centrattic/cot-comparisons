Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who yelled at the kids' mom for not including their disabled daughter is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's daughter was sitting outside watching other kids play, and when the author (or their partner) noticed, they yelled at the mother. The daughter later got included, but the author is being questioned about their reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has cerebral palsy and was sitting alone while others played. The parent's intention was to ensure their child was included, which is a valid concern. However, the method used was yelling, which can be seen as aggressive. The parent might feel justified because they want their child to be treated fairly, but yelling can escalate the situation and might not be the best approach.\n\nOn the other hand, the other mother's reaction was to storm off, which could imply that she felt attacked. Yelling in public can be confrontational and might not encourage the desired change in behavior. The parent could have approached the situation differently, maybe speaking to the mother calmly to explain their concerns instead of yelling. However, the underlying issue of excluding a child with a disability is a serious one, and the parent's frustration is understandable.\n\nThe partner thinks they overreacted, which adds another perspective. The parent's goal was positive\u2014to include their daughter\u2014but the means were confrontational. While the intention was good, the method might have been counterproductive. It's possible that the other mother wasn't aware of the exclusion or had her own reasons. Yelling might have caused embarrassment rather than prompting inclusion.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the parent's action was driven by a desire to protect their child, but the method used could be seen as inappropriate. So, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong), but I need to be careful. The parent isn't necessarily wrong in wanting inclusion, but the yelling is where the issue is. So the answer is A.\n"
