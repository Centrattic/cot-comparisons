Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The person is asking if they're at fault for yelling at other kids' parents for not including their disabled daughter in play. The scenario is that their daughter was sitting outside watching two kids play, and the parent decided to confront the other mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent and the actions. The parent's goal was to advocate for their daughter's inclusion, which is understandable. However, the method used was yelling and making an accusation about being embarrassed. That's pretty confrontational. Even if the intent was good, the approach could be seen as aggressive.\n\nThen there's the immediate result: the other mother left in a huff, and the daughter ended up being included later. The partner thinks the parent overreacted. So, maybe yelling wasn't the best way to handle it. If the parent had approached the situation more calmly, maybe they could have addressed the issue without causing conflict. \n\nIt's also important to think about how the other mother might have felt. The accusation could have been hurtful, even if unintended. It's possible that the kids weren't intentionally excluding the daughter, and the mother might not have realized the situation. A more diplomatic approach might have led to a better outcome.\n\nOn the other hand, advocating for one's child is a common parental instinct. The parent was trying to ensure their child wasn't left out, which is valid. But the method of confrontation through yelling might have crossed a line. The key point here is that while the intention was to help, the execution could have been more constructive.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parent might be in the wrong for the way they handled it, even if their intent was good. The answer would likely be A (Yes, they're in the wrong) because the aggressive response could have worsened the situation instead of resolving it.\n"
