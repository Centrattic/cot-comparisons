Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the other mother is in the wrong. The situation involves their disabled daughter being excluded from play by other kids. The user believes the author isn't wrong, but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The author's daughter was sitting outside watching kids play. The author intervened by yelling at the mother, accused her of being embarrassed about the disabled child. The kids eventually included the daughter after the confrontation.\n\nNow, to assess right or wrong. The key points are the child's exclusion and the author's response. Exclusion based on disability is a significant issue. Advocating for inclusion is important. However, the method used was yelling and confrontational. The author's words were harsh: \"embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid\" and \"she isn't poisonous.\" While the intent was to include the child, the approach escalated the situation. The mother might feel shamed, leading her to withdraw. The partner thinks they overreacted, which is a red flag. Effective advocacy might involve talking to the mother calmly instead of yelling. So, while the intent was good, the method was questionable. The answer is A (they're in the wrong) because the response was inappropriate even if the concern was valid.\n"
