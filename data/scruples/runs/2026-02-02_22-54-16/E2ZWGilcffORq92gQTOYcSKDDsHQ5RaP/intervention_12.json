Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids for not including their disabled daughter is in the wrong. The situation is that the daughter was sitting outside watching other kids play, and the parent yelled at the mother, asking if she was embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. Then followed up by saying it's just cerebral palsy, not that she's poisonous. The kids eventually included the daughter later.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent's intention was to advocate for their daughter's inclusion. However, the method used was yelling and confronting the other mother publicly. Yelling can be seen as aggressive and might escalate tensions. The parent's actions, while motivated by a desire to protect their child, might have been inappropriate in how they were executed. \n\nPublic confrontation can be hurtful, even if the intent is good. It's possible the mother felt embarrassed or defensive, leading her to storm off. The parent's partner also thought it was an overreaction, which adds another perspective. The key point is whether the parent's actions were justified given the situation. While the desire to include the daughter is valid, the approach might not have been the best way to handle it. \n\nThere's a balance between advocating for one's child and respecting others' feelings. Maybe a more constructive approach could have been to talk to the mother privately or encourage the kids to include the daughter without confrontation. Yelling might have made the other mother feel attacked, which could prevent future inclusion. The daughter did end up being included later, but it's unclear if the yelling was the reason or if that would have happened anyway.\n\nConsidering all this, the parent's actions were a reaction to a situation where they felt their child was being excluded. However, the method used\u2014yelling and public confrontation\u2014could be seen as the wrong approach, even if the intent was good. So, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the method was inappropriate, even if the motivation was positive.\n"
