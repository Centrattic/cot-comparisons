Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at kids for not including their disabled daughter. The parent saw their daughter excluded while playing outside, went to confront the mother, and ended up yelling. The daughter then got included after the confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has cerebral palsy, which is a physical disability. The parent felt her child was being excluded. The parent approached the mother of the other kids and yelled, maybe out of frustration or wanting to protect their child. But yelling might be seen as aggressive, even if the intention was good.\n\nThe parent's partner thinks they overreacted. The key points here are the parent's method of addressing the situation. Yelling could be seen as confrontational and might have embarrassed the mother. But the parent's concern for their child's inclusion and well-being is valid. The daughter did eventually get included, so maybe the outcome was positive, but the method was questionable.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally expected to handle such situations respectfully. Yelling might escalate things and could make the other parent defensive, potentially leading to a better long-term solution if handled calmly. However, the parent was acting in their child's interest. It's a balance between advocating for the child and respecting others.\n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because while the intent was to help their daughter, yelling might not be the best approach. It could have been handled more calmly to encourage inclusion without confrontation. But maybe B (not in the wrong) because the parent was defending their child from exclusion. Hmm. The community might have different views. Some might support the parent's advocacy, others might criticize the method. But overall, the parent's reaction, while understandable, was not the most constructive way to handle it. So probably A.\n"
