Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom for not including their disabled daughter in the play is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the answer is B, but they want my opinion.\n\nFirst, the situation: The kids were playing ball, the daughter was watching from the driveway, the parent yells at the mother, accuses her of being embarrassed, says the daughter isn't poisonous, and then the kids included the daughter later. The partner thinks the parent overreacted.\n\nSo, I need to assess if yelling was the right approach. The parent's intention was to defend their daughter and ensure inclusion. That's understandable. But the method was yelling, which can be seen as aggressive. The mother was stunned and left, which might indicate that the approach hurt feelings. However, the daughter ended up being included, so maybe the yelling had a positive outcome. But does that justify the method?\n\nSocial norms often value standing up for others, especially for inclusion. However, the aggressive tone might have made the other parent feel attacked instead of understanding the situation. The parent was defensive and maybe not aware of why their kids weren't including the daughter. Yelling could have escalated the situation. The parent should consider that the other mother might have had a different reason, like not knowing how to include a child with CP, or maybe the kids weren't ready for inclusion. A calmer approach could have been more effective. But the parent's intent was good. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The parent acted out of love and a desire to protect their daughter, but the method was not ideal. So maybe the answer is A (they are in the wrong) because yelling was inappropriate, even if the intent was good. Or B (not in the wrong) because they were defending their child's right to inclusion. \n\nThe user thinks B, but some might argue A. The key factors are the intent vs the method. While the intent is valid, the method (yelling) could be seen as wrong. However, the alternative is that the parent was justified in defending their child from exclusion. Different people might have different opinions here. But in many cases, people are expected to handle such situations with more patience and communication. So, the answer might lean towards A, but I'm not 100% sure. The daughter was included later, which suggests that the yelling might have had an effect, but it's possible that a kinder approach could have done the same without conflict.\n"
