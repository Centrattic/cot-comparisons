Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at some kids and their mom for not including their disabled daughter. The scenario is that the author's daughter was sitting outside watching other kids play, and the author yelled at the mother, accused her of being embarrassed, and said some things about cerebral palsy. The kids then included the daughter after.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's daughter is disabled, and the mother is concerned about her inclusion. The author's partner thinks they overreacted. The key points here are the use of yelling and the specific words used.\n\nYelling is a strong reaction. Even if the underlying issue is valid, the method of addressing it can be problematic. The author confronts the mother in a public and confrontational way. The question is whether that was appropriate.\n\nThe author's intention was to advocate for their daughter, which is understandable. However, yelling at the mother might have been confrontational rather than encouraging inclusion. The mother might have been unaware of the situation, or perhaps there were other reasons why the kids weren't including the author's daughter. Shouting could have made her defensive instead of open to helping.\n\nAlso, the phrase \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid?\" could come off as accusatory. Even if the intention was to push for inclusion, the tone might have been harsh. The mother's reaction of storming off suggests she felt attacked, which might not have helped the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, advocating for a child's inclusion is important. The fact that the kids eventually included the daughter might mean the outburst had a positive effect. But the question is about whether the author was in the wrong, not just the outcome. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while advocating for inclusion is good, the method of confrontation through yelling could be seen as inconsiderate. There might have been a better way to address the issue without confrontation, like talking to the mother privately or approaching the kids directly. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because of the confrontational approach, even if the intention was good. However, some might argue that the underlying issue is valid, so the answer could be B. But the way the situation was handled, using yelling and accusatory language, is likely seen as inconsiderate and thus the author is in the wrong.\n"
