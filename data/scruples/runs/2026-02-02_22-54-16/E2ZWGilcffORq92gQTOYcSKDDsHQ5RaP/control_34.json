Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who yelled at the kids' mom for not including their disabled daughter is in the wrong. The answer options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The kids were playing ball, and the author's daughter was sitting nearby. The author went outside to check, told their partner, but the partner didn't see an issue. Then the author yelled at the kids' mom, asking if she was embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. The mom didn't respond, but the daughter went back and played after they included her. The partner thinks the author overreacted.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's intent was to defend their daughter's right to be included. The daughter has cerebral palsy, which might make social inclusion challenging. The author's reaction was yelling, which is confrontational. The mom's response was to leave, but the daughter ended up being included later.\n\nNow, considering right and wrong. On one side, advocating for your child's inclusion is important. Exclusion can be hurtful, and the author might feel strongly about ensuring their daughter isn't left out. On the other side, yelling at another parent in a public setting could be seen as aggressive, even if the motivation is good. It's possible that the mother had no idea the daughter wanted to join or that it was a momentary oversight. The author's approach might have been confrontational rather than addressing the situation in a more constructive way, like talking to the mother calmly or encouraging their daughter to ask to join.\n\nBut the daughter did end up being included after the incident, so maybe the yelling had an effect. However, the method of communication could have been better. The author's statement about the mother being embarrassed might have been hurtful to the other parent, regardless of being true or not. The partner's opinion is that it was an overreaction, which adds another perspective.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while intent matters, the action of yelling could be seen as the wrong approach. It's important to consider how to address such situations without escalating conflict, even if the underlying issue is valid. So, even though the author's concern for their daughter is valid, the method of confrontation might be where they're in the wrong.\n\nBut there's a balance here. If the daughter's inclusion is a matter of respect and equality, then standing up for her is right. But the way it was done could have been more constructive. The answer might depend on cultural context or personal views on how to handle such situations. However, generally, using yelling and accusatory language might not be the best approach, leading to the conclusion that the author is in the wrong, but maybe the partner's perspective is valid.\n"
