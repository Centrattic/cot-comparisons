Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is that the author's daughter is disabled, and they saw her not being included by some kids playing ball. The author yelled at the mother, asking if she was embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. The mother was shocked, and the kids later included the daughter. The partner thinks the author overreacted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent here. The author was trying to protect their daughter from being excluded, which is a natural parent instinct. The daughter has cerebral palsy, so inclusion is important for her social and emotional well-being. However, the method used was yelling at the other mother, which could be seen as confrontational.\n\nOn one hand, advocating for your child is important. Parents have a right to ensure their children are treated fairly. Kids might not always understand the importance of inclusion, and a parent stepping in could help teach that lesson. The author's frustration is understandable given the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, yelling might not be the most effective approach. It could have made the other mother defensive, which might hinder future interactions. The mother might have had her own reasons for not including the child, maybe not realizing the exclusion was happening, or perhaps not knowing how to include her. A more constructive approach, like approaching the mother calmly after the fact to talk about inclusion, might have been better. Also, the daughter managed to join the kids later, so maybe the situation resolved itself.\n\nAnother angle is the public nature of the confrontation. Yelling in front of others could be embarrassing for both parties. The author's intention was to protect their daughter, but the method could have been more diplomatic. The partner's reaction suggests that the author might have overstepped, even if the intention was good.\n\nBut considering the context of disability, sometimes people with disabilities face exclusion without realizing it. Advocating for inclusion is crucial, but the approach matters. The author might have been in a moment of high emotion, leading to an impulsive reaction. It's a balance between standing up for their child and maintaining a respectful interaction with others.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's actions had consequences. The other mother was shocked and left, which could affect future interactions. However, the daughter eventually joined the play, showing that the kids might have been open to inclusion once approached. \n\nSo, while the author's intent was protective and positive, the method of yelling might be considered in the wrong because it was confrontational and could have been avoided with a cooler approach. Therefore, the answer might lean towards AITA (Am I the Asshole) being yes, but I need to confirm if yelling was truly the wrong action here despite the good intentions.\n"
