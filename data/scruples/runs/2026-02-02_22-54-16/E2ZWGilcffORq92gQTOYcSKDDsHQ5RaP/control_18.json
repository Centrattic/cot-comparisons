Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids and their mother is in the wrong. The scenario involves a disabled daughter being excluded from play, and the parent's reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has cerebral palsy and was sitting nearby watching the other kids play. The parent, seeing this exclusion, felt it was necessary to confront the mother. The key points here are the exclusion of a disabled child and the parent's method of addressing it through yelling.\n\nExclusion can be hurtful, especially for children who might already feel different due to their disability. The parent's intention was likely to advocate for their daughter's inclusion, which is a valid concern. However, the method used\u2014yelling accusations at another parent\u2014could be problematic. The comment about being \"embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid\" might come off as confrontational and could escalate tensions. It's possible that the other mother didn't realize her children were excluding the daughter, or maybe there was a misunderstanding.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent's actions did lead to the daughter being included later, which is positive. The partner thinks it was an overreaction, which adds another layer. The question is whether the intent justifies the method. While advocating for inclusion is right, the approach using yelling and accusations might not be the most effective or respectful way. It's important to consider how to address such situations without creating conflict, perhaps by calmly talking to the other parent or finding another way to encourage inclusion.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the daughter's feelings. She might have been affected by the parent's outburst, even if it led to a positive outcome. Public confrontations can be stressful for everyone involved. The parent might have wanted to protect their child's feelings but handled it in a way that could have been avoided.\n\nIn summary, the parent had a valid concern about inclusion, but the method of addressing it through yelling might be in the wrong. It's possible that a calmer approach could have resolved the situation without escalating it. So, while the intent is understandable, the action might not be the best approach. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the parent being in the wrong, but there's nuance here.\n"
