Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom is in the wrong. The situation involves their disabled daughter being excluded from play.\n\nFirst, the parent saw their daughter sitting alone while other kids played nearby. They felt their daughter was being excluded because of her disability. So they confronted the mother with a harsh comment about being embarrassed. Then they added another comment downplaying the disability. The kids later included the daughter, but the mother didn't respond.\n\nHmm, the parent's intention was to defend their daughter's inclusion. But did they handle it the right way? Yelling and making accusatory remarks might have been aggressive. The mother could feel attacked, which might not help the situation. However, the concern about inclusion is valid. The parent was trying to advocate for their child's social integration, which is important.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way to approach it. Instead of yelling, maybe talking calmly or encouraging the kids to include her daughter. The parent's actions might have caused the mother to feel defensive, making her retreat into the caravan. The daughter ended up being included later, so the outcome was positive. However, the method used was confrontational. \n\nSo, while the parent's intent was good, the method could be questioned. Is the intent enough to excuse the yelling? Or does the approach matter? In terms of right and wrong, even if the motive is good, yelling could be seen as wrong. So maybe answer A, they are in the wrong, but I'm a bit conflicted because the intent was to protect their child.\n"
