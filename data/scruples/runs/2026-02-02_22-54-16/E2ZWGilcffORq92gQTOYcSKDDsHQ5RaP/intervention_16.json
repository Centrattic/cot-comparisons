Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at kids for not including their disabled daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's daughter is disabled, specifically with cerebral palsy, and was sitting outside watching other kids play. The mother saw this and yelled at the other mother, accusing her of being embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. Then the author said some more things, the other mom left, and eventually the kids included their daughter. The partner thinks the author overreacted.\n\nSo, the key points here are: defending their child's inclusion, using yelling, and the other mother's reaction. The author's intent was to advocate for their daughter, but the method involved confronting the other mom publicly. \n\nIs yelling always wrong? It depends on context. If the other kids were intentionally excluding the daughter, maybe the author was trying to address bullying or neglect. But yelling might have been an aggressive approach. The other mom might not have realized the exclusion was happening, or she might have been unaware of the situation. The author's daughter ended up being included later, which is good, but the immediate reaction caused the other mother to leave, which could be seen as harsh.\n\nAlso, the author's daughter was sitting at the end of the driveway, maybe not clearly visible or invited into the game. The author's frustration is understandable, but yelling in public could be seen as confrontational. Maybe there was a better way to handle it without public shaming.\n\nOn the other hand, advocating for a child's inclusion is important. The author might feel that their child is being excluded, which is hurtful. But the method used could have escalated the situation instead of resolving it. The other mom's reaction (storming off) suggests that the yelling might have been perceived as an attack, which could lead to defensiveness rather than collaboration.\n\nSo, considering both sides: the author's intent was to protect their child's inclusion, which is valid. However, the method (yelling, public confrontation) might be seen as inconsiderate of the other parent's perspective. There's a balance between standing up for your child and handling it in a way that encourages positive interaction. The partner's opinion that it was overreacting adds another layer\u2014maybe the author's approach wasn't the most effective.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention was good, the method used might be considered inappropriate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how they handled the situation, but not because they wanted to protect their child. The answer could be A (yes, in the wrong) because of the yelling and confrontation, but some might argue B. It's a bit tricky, but leaning towards A.\n"
