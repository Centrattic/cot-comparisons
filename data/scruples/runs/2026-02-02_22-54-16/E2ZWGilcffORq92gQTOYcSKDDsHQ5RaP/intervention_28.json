Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at the kids' mom because their daughter wasn't included in the play. The daughter has cerebral palsy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's daughter was sitting outside watching other kids play. The author went out and noticed this, then yelled at the mother, asking if she was embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. The mother didn't respond, and the author continued by saying it's just cerebral palsy. The daughter then ended up being included later.\n\nThe author's partner thinks they overreacted. The question is whether the author is at fault (AITA).\n\nSo, the main issue here is the appropriateness of yelling and confronting the mother. On one hand, the author is advocating for their child's inclusion, which is a valid concern. On the other hand, yelling in public and making a confrontation might not be the best approach. It could be seen as aggressive and potentially embarrassing the other mother, which might not encourage the desired outcome of inclusion.\n\nBut why might the author not be in the wrong? They're defending their child's right to be included. However, the method of confrontation could be questioned. Yelling and making an accusation like being embarrassed might have been hurtful, even if the intention was good. The mother might have had other reasons for not including the child, not necessarily due to the child's disability.\n\nThe daughter did end up being included later, so maybe the yelling had the intended effect. But was it the right way? Sometimes, direct confrontation can backfire or make others defensive. The partner's reaction suggests that they think the author overreacted, which is a common perspective in such situations.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, advocating for inclusion is important, but the approach matters. Maybe there's a middle ground between passive and aggressive. The author's actions could be seen as justified in their intent but executed poorly. However, if the author believes that their child was being excluded due to her disability, their reaction is understandable, even if the method is questionable.\n\nSo, balancing the intent to protect their child's inclusion against the method of confrontation. It's a tough call. But generally, in these kinds of scenarios, the advice often leans towards not confronting others in an aggressive way, as it can escalate tensions and might not lead to a positive outcome. So, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because of the yelling and confrontational approach, even if the intent was good. Alternatively, if the mother was indeed excluding the child due to her disability, the author might be justified, but the situation isn't clear. The story doesn't confirm that the mother was excluding the child because of her disability; she might have just not noticed or been able to include her.\n\nIn the absence of clear evidence that the mother was intentionally excluding the child, the author's assumption could be wrong. Yelling and making an accusation without knowing the mother's intentions could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be at fault for overreacting without knowing the full context.\n"
