Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they are in the wrong for yelling at kids for not including their disabled daughter. So first, the situation: their daughter was sitting outside, watching other kids play. The parent got upset and yelled at the mother, asking if she was embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid, and mentioned that cerebral palsy isn't contagious.\n\nHmm. The parent's intention was to advocate for their daughter's inclusion, which is understandable. But the method was yelling and confronting the other mother directly. Now, is that the right approach? Well, sometimes in emotionally charged situations, people act out of frustration. The parent might have felt their daughter was being excluded, which is valid. But yelling might not be the best way to handle it. It could make the other parent defensive and less likely to include the child in the future.\n\nAlso, the daughter ended up being included after that, so maybe the kids were open to it once the parent was gone. But the public confrontation could have caused embarrassment for both the other mother and the kids. The partner thinks it was an overreaction, which is a common perspective when someone yells in a public setting.\n\nOn the other hand, advocating for inclusion is important. The parent might have felt their daughter was being left out, and the other mother wasn't facilitating inclusion. But maybe there were other ways to handle it, like talking to the other parent privately or encouraging the kids gently. Yelling might have made the situation more uncomfortable, even if the intention was good.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parent's actions were driven by a desire to protect and include their daughter, but the method used (yelling) could be seen as inappropriate. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because yelling in a public, confrontational manner might not be the best approach, even with good intentions.\n"
