Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who yelled at the kids' mom is in the wrong. The situation is that their disabled daughter was excluded from play, so the parent yelled at the other mother. The daughter then joined the kids after the incident.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has cerebral palsy. The parent saw their child being excluded and felt upset. Yelling might have been an emotional reaction. But was it the right approach?\n\nThe parent's intention was to defend their child, which is understandable. However, yelling at the other mother could be seen as aggressive. The mother might have been unaware of the exclusion, or maybe the kids were just playing and didn't realize. The parent's public confrontation might have embarrassed the other mom, leading her to leave. Also, the daughter did eventually join the play, so maybe the yelling had the desired effect, but maybe there were better ways to handle it.\n\nOn one hand, advocating for a child's inclusion is important. On the other hand, yelling could be seen as overreacting. The partner thinks it was an overreaction, which adds another perspective. Maybe the parent should have approached the situation more calmly, maybe talked to the kids directly or asked the mother if there was a reason the kids weren't playing with the daughter. Yelling might have made the other mom defensive instead of addressing the issue constructively.\n\nAlso, the parent's comment about being embarrassed or the child being poisonous could be hurtful. Even if the intent was to challenge the exclusion, the method might have been inappropriate. The other mom's reaction of leaving suggests that the approach was too harsh.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parent's actions were driven by a desire to include their child, but the method used was confrontational. Therefore, they might be in the wrong for the way they handled it, even if the intent was good. The answer might be A (yes, they're in the wrong) because yelling in public and confronting the other mom aggressively is not the best approach, even if the intention was to help their child.\n"
