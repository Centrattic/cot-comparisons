Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person (the author) is wrong for yelling at some kids and their mom for not including their disabled daughter in play. The parent yelled and said some things like asking if the mom was embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid and mentioned that the daughter isn't poisonous. The other kids eventually included the daughter after the incident.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The daughter has cerebral palsy and wanted to play, but the other kids didn't include her. The author was watching and felt upset, leading to yelling. But is yelling the right response?\n\nThe parent's actions were in defense of their child, but yelling at the other children and their mother might not be the best approach. The mother was a bystander; she might not have been aware of the exclusion. The author's public confrontation could have embarrassed the mother and the kids, possibly making the situation worse. Even if the kids later included the daughter, the method used might not model good behavior. The partner thinks the author overreacted, which is a common perspective here.\n\nHowever, the parent's intent was to protect their child from exclusion, which is understandable. But yelling in public could be seen as aggressive, and the solution wasn't collaborative. The mother might have felt attacked, leading to her walking away. It's possible that a different approach, like talking to the kids calmly or involving the mother respectfully, could have been more effective without causing tension.\n\nOn the other hand, defending a child's right to participate and be included is important. The parent might feel that their child's feelings are often overlooked, so strong actions are necessary. But the public nature of the confrontation and the choice of words (like \"embarrassed to be seen with\") might come off as accusatory rather than helpful.\n\nSo, the answer would depend on balancing the intent to include the daughter versus the method used. While the parent's concern is valid, the yelling might be considered in the wrong because it's an aggressive response that could discourage future interactions. The mother might need support to understand how to include children with disabilities, but yelling doesn't facilitate that. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the manner used, even if the intention was good.\n"
