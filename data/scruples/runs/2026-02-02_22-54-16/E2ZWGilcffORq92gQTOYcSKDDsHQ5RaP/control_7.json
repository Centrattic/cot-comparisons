Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom for not including their disabled daughter is in the wrong. The scenario is that the daughter was sitting outside watching other kids play, and the parent (the author) got upset and yelled at the mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They were trying to protect their daughter's feelings and ensure she was included. Excluding a child, especially one with a disability, can be hurtful. The parent might have felt that the other kids were being exclusionary, even if unintentionally. The yelling was an emotional reaction to seeing their child left out.\n\nOn the other hand, yelling might not be the best approach. It can escalate the situation and potentially make the other parent defensive. The mother might have been unaware of her children's exclusion. The author's approach could have been more constructive, like approaching the mother calmly to discuss inclusion rather than confronting her in front of others.\n\nThe daughter eventually got included, which is positive. The partner's opinion is that the author overreacted, which adds another layer. The key here is whether the method used was appropriate. While the intention was good\u2014to advocate for their daughter\u2014the method of yelling might be seen as inconsiderate, not addressing the root issue of inclusion effectively. \n\nHowever, given the emotional context and the desire to protect their child from exclusion, some might argue the parent is justified in their reaction. But in terms of right/wrong, the author's approach could be seen as wrong because yelling isn't the best solution. It's possible that the author is in the wrong (A), but maybe there's nuance. Wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the parent acted out of concern but used an inappropriate method, maybe the answer is A. However, others might see it as defending their child. The dilemma here is balancing empathy and the method used. The answer might be A because yelling is not the right approach, but some might say B. Need to decide based on social norms. Generally, yelling is not the right response, so answer A.\n"
