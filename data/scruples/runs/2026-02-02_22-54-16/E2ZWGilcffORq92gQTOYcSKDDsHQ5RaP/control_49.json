Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom for not including their disabled daughter is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's daughter was sitting outside, watching other kids play. The author got angry when the other kids (and their mom) didn't include her daughter. They yelled at the mom, making her leave, and then the kids eventually included the daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has a disability, and the author's reaction is driven by wanting her to be included. The author feels that the other kids' mom was excluding their child, possibly due to her disability, which led to the outburst. \n\nBut was yelling the right approach? The author's partner thinks they overreacted. Yelling can be seen as confrontational and might have made the situation worse. Instead of fostering a positive environment for inclusion, the yelling might have embarrassed the other mom and the kids, making them less likely to include the daughter in the future.\n\nHowever, the author's intention was to advocate for their child. It's important to support a child's need for inclusion, especially when facing disability-related stigma. But the method used was aggressive. Maybe a better approach would be to talk to the kids gently, encourage inclusion without confrontation. Yelling could have been hurtful and counterproductive.\n\nAlso, the outcome was positive in the end\u2014the kids included the daughter after the yelling. But does that justify the means? The mom's reaction was to storm off, which might indicate that the yelling caused more harm. The author's approach might have been a knee-jerk reaction out of concern, but it's possible that a calmer, more constructive method could have achieved the same result without the conflict.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author's intent was good (supporting inclusion), but the method (yelling) was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for handling the situation poorly, even if their intention was in the right place.\n"
