Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent who got angry because their disabled daughter was excluded from a game. The parent yelled at the mother of the kids who were playing, asking if she was embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. Then the daughter went back outside and the kids included her after that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent and the action. The parent's daughter was excluded, which could be hurtful. The parent was trying to stand up for their child, which is a natural instinct. But the method was yelling, which might be seen as aggressive. The question is whether the parent overreacted.\n\nOn one hand, protecting a child from exclusion, especially when they have a disability, is important. The parent was advocating for their daughter's right to be included. The mother's reaction might have been a result of the initial exclusion, which could be unintentional. Kids sometimes don't realize they're excluding others, so maybe the parent could have approached it more calmly, like talking to the other mother first instead of yelling.\n\nBut on the other hand, the parent's frustration is understandable. The daughter was sitting alone, watching the others play, which could be isolating. The parent's outburst might have been a result of frustration and wanting immediate inclusion. However, yelling might not be the best approach and could have been counterproductive. The other mother might have been taken aback, which led her to walk away, but the kids eventually included the daughter. The partner's opinion that they overreacted is also a factor to consider.\n\nSo, maybe the parent isn't entirely in the wrong because the motivation was to include their child, but the method of yelling was not the best approach. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they used yelling, which is aggressive and could be seen as confrontational, even if the intent was good, it's possible they overstepped. But depending on cultural norms and situations, standing up for one's child is sometimes seen as justified. However, in public and in a loud manner, it might be considered inconsiderate. \n\nThe answer might be that the parent is not in the wrong because they were advocating for their child, but others might see it as overreacting. The final answer depends on whether the action (yelling) was the problem, even if the intent was good. The key is balancing advocacy with appropriate methods. Since the daughter ended up being included, maybe the result was positive. But the method could have been better. However, the question is about being in the wrong. If the parent's action was yelling, which is considered aggressive, then maybe answer A (in the wrong). But if the intent was to help the child, answer B (not in the wrong). It's a bit of a toss-up. I think it's a common dilemma where emotions run high when it comes to a child. The partner's opinion is that they overreacted, which adds to the thought that maybe they were in the wrong. So, I lean towards A (in the wrong) because yelling is not the best approach, even with good intentions.\n"
