Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for yelling at other kids and their mother for not including their disabled daughter.\n\nFirst, the situation: The parent saw their daughter, who has cerebral palsy, sitting on the veranda watching other kids play. The other kids were playing ball, and the daughter wasn't included. The parent yelled at the mother, asking if she was embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. Then added something about the daughter not being poisonous.\n\nNow, the parent is asking if they were in the wrong. The user's opinion is that they aren't, but wants others' input.\n\nLet me consider the possible angles. On one hand, the parent was defending their child's right to be included, which is a valid concern. Exclusion can be hurtful, especially for a child with disabilities who might already face challenges. The parent's frustration is understandable. However, the method of confronting the other mother by yelling might not be the best approach. Public shaming or confrontational tactics can be seen as aggressive, which might escalate the situation instead of addressing the issue constructively. The mother might have been unaware of the exclusion or had her own reasons, and a direct approach might not have been effective. The daughter eventually joined the game, so maybe the yelling had an unintended effect. The partner's opinion that it was an overreaction is a point to consider. While the parent's intent was noble, the method used could be questioned. So there's a balance between standing up for one's child and handling the situation respectfully.\n"
