Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mother is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent's disabled daughter not being included in play by other kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has cerebral palsy. The parent (the author) saw the kids playing and the daughter was watching from a distance. They went to confront the mother, yelling about being embarrassed. Then the author made a comment about the disability not being contagious. The mother left, but later the kids included the daughter.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author's reaction was justified. On one hand, defending their child's right to be included and challenging the exclusion is understandable. On the other hand, yelling at the mother and making a public confrontation might have been harsh. \n\nThe key points to consider: Was the exclusion intentional? Did the mother have any control over the kids' actions? The author's approach was confrontational, which might have been unnecessary. Maybe a more diplomatic approach could have encouraged inclusion without shaming the mother. Also, the mother's response was to storm off, which might indicate she was uncomfortable or didn't know how to handle the situation.\n\nThe partner thinks the author overreacted. It's possible that yelling in public could have made the mother defensive, making it harder for her to include the daughter. However, the daughter did eventually get included, so maybe the author's actions had an effect. But was the method appropriate?\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the mother was responsible for the kids' behavior. If she wasn't aware they were excluding the daughter, then confronting her might not be the right approach. The author should have perhaps talked to the kids directly or approached the mother in a calmer, more constructive way. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the way they handled it, even if the intent was good.\n"
