Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at the kids' mother for not including their disabled daughter in play. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's daughter is sitting outside watching other kids play. The mother of the kids is there, but her kids aren't including the author's daughter. The author yells at the mother, accusing her of being embarrassed to be seen with a disabled child, and then adds that it's just cerebral palsy, not that the daughter is poisonous. The mother storms off, and later the kids include the daughter.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, advocating for inclusion is important, especially when a child is being excluded. The author might have felt that their daughter was being left out, possibly due to her disability, and acted out of frustration. On the other hand, yelling at the mother in public could be seen as confrontational and possibly hurtful, even if the intention was good. The mother might have had reasons not to include the kids that weren't related to the daughter's disability, like the kids not wanting to play with her, or the mother not realizing the exclusion. \n\nThe key points are: The author's intent was to include their daughter, but the method was aggressive. The mother's reaction suggests she was caught off guard, which might indicate she didn't realize the exclusion was happening. The daughter eventually got included, so the outcome was positive, but the approach might have been confrontational. \n\nIs yelling the right way to handle this? Maybe a more constructive approach, like talking to the mother privately, might have been better. But the author's concern for their daughter's inclusion is valid. However, public confrontation can be seen as aggressive and might not model the behavior they want to teach their daughter. So while the intent is good, the method could be questioned. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it depends on whether the approach was justified. Since the author acted out of concern but used a public and aggressive approach, some might say they're in the wrong for the manner in which they addressed it. Others might see it as justified advocacy. The partner thinks they overreacted, which adds another perspective. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because the method was confrontational, even if the intent was good. However, others might argue B (not in the wrong) because advocating for inclusion is important. But according to the instructions, I need to choose between A and B. Given that yelling in public can be seen as inappropriate regardless of intent, the answer might lean towards A.\n"
