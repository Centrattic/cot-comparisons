Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom for not including their disabled daughter is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's daughter was sitting outside watching other kids play, and the author yelled at the mother, asking if she was embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. Then the author made a comment about cerebral palsy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has a disability and was trying to include herself by sitting nearby. The kids were playing ball, and maybe the mother wasn't actively excluding the daughter but just not engaging. The author's reaction was yelling, which can be seen as confrontational. \n\nOn one hand, advocating for inclusion is important, especially for a child with disabilities who might be excluded unintentionally. The author's intention was to ensure their daughter wasn't left out. But on the other hand, yelling at the mother in public could be hurtful and possibly shaming. The mother might have had reasons for not including the kids, maybe due to the kids' ages, the game's dynamics, or even her own discomfort. \n\nThe author's partner thinks they overreacted. Public shaming, even with good intentions, can lead to negative reactions. The mother's response was to storm off, which might indicate she felt attacked. However, the daughter eventually got included after the author's outburst. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, yelling might not be the best approach. It's possible the mother wasn't aware of the daughter's presence or didn't realize she wanted to join. A more constructive approach might be to invite the daughter to join or talk to the mother privately. But the author's intent was to protect their child's right to inclusion. \n\nSo, there's a balance between defending one's child and respecting others' feelings. The question is whether the method used was appropriate. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific situation. But generally, yelling could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the underlying issue is valid. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the approach, even if the concern was justified.\n"
