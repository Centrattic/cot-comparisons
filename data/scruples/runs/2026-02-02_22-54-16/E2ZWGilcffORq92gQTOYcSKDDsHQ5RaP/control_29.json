Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the parent yelling at other kids and their mom because they didn't include their disabled daughter in play.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has cerebral palsy and was sitting nearby watching the kids play. The parent yelled at the mother of the other kids, asking if she was embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. Then they made a comment about the daughter not being poisonous. The other mom left, but the daughter eventually got included.\n\nNow, thinking about parental responsibility. Parents often feel protective of their children, especially when their child is being excluded. The parent's reaction comes from a place of wanting their child to be included. However, the method used was yelling, which can be seen as aggressive. \n\nBut, is the parent in the wrong? Well, the other mom might have been unaware that their daughter was excluded. Yelling at her could have been a harsh reaction. However, the exclusion of a child with a disability can be hurtful, and advocating for inclusion is important. The parent might have felt that the other kids were being exclusionary without realizing it. \n\nOn one hand, yelling is not the best approach. It could escalate the situation and might make the other parent defensive. On the other hand, the parent's intention was to ensure their child isn't excluded, which is a valid concern. The daughter did end up being included later, so maybe the yelling had the desired effect, but in a negative way. \n\nBut the key here is whether the parent was in the wrong. The question is about moral responsibility. While the intention was good, the method was confrontational. The parent could have approached the situation more calmly, maybe by talking to the mother privately first. Yelling in public might have been embarrassing for the other mom, which isn't helpful. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the parent's actions were overreacting. The partner's opinion that they overreacted is a point to consider. The parent might have been in the wrong because the approach was aggressive, even if the intent was to protect their child. However, the desire to ensure inclusion is valid. It's a balance between standing up for their child and maintaining a respectful approach.\n"
