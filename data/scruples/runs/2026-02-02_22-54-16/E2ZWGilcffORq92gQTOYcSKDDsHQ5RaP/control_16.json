Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom for not including their disabled daughter is at fault. First, I need to assess the situation.\n\nThe key points here are that the mother saw her daughter excluded from the play. She yelled at the other mother, which is a strong reaction. The daughter later joined the kids, and the partner thinks she overreacted. The main question is whether the yelling was justified.\n\nOn one hand, advocating for inclusion is important, especially for a disabled child who might feel left out. The mother's intention might have been to protect her child's feelings and ensure she's included. But on the other hand, yelling at another parent in public could be seen as aggressive. It might have embarrassed the other mom and the kids, potentially making the situation worse. The daughter eventually joined the play after the confrontation, so maybe the yelling didn't lead to the desired outcome immediately.\n\nThe other mom didn't respond, which could mean she was taken aback and left the situation. The daughter's action of bringing the chair back shows she wanted to join, but the other kids had already excluded her. The partner's opinion that the mother overreacted is a red flag. Public yelling might not be the best approach to foster inclusion. The mother could have tried another method, like talking to the other parent calmly or addressing the kids directly.\n\nCerebral palsy is a physical disability, and the mother's comment about it not making her \"poisonous\" suggests she's defending her daughter from stigma. However, the approach might have been confrontational. It's possible that the other mother didn't realize the exclusion was happening, or maybe there was a misunderstanding. Yelling might have escalated the situation instead of resolving it.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the intent was good, but the method was problematic. The mother's actions could have been more constructive. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because while the intent to include her daughter is valid, the way she handled it was inappropriate. However, I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing, like if the other kids were intentionally excluding her or if the mother had a history of this. But based on the given info, it seems the author overreacted.\n"
