Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The author's daughter is sitting outside watching other kids play. The author yells at the kids' mom for not including their disabled daughter. Then the daughter ends up being included later. The partner thinks the author overreacted.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about inclusion and how the author handled it. The daughter has cerebral palsy, which the author mentions. The author confronted the mother by yelling, which might be seen as aggressive. But the intention was to advocate for their child's inclusion. \n\nOn one hand, advocating for inclusion is important. It's right to want your child to be included. On the other hand, yelling at someone else's parent might not be the best approach. It could have been more effective to talk to the mother calmly instead of yelling. The mother might have been embarrassed or defensive, which could escalate the situation. \n\nThe daughter did end up joining them eventually, so maybe the yelling had some effect. But the method might have been harsh. The partner's opinion that the author overreacted adds another layer. Sometimes, even if the intention is good, the way it's done matters. Yelling can come off as confrontational and might make others less likely to engage in the desired behavior in the future.\n\nSo, the author's intention was to help their daughter, which is understandable. However, the approach of yelling might not be the most constructive way to handle it. It's possible that a more diplomatic approach could have achieved the same result without causing tension. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the manner in which they addressed the situation, even if the intent was good.\n"
