Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who yelled at the kids' mom for not including their disabled daughter is in the wrong. The situation is that the daughter was sitting outside watching other kids play, but wasn't included. The parent then yells at the mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has cerebral palsy, which is a disability. The parent's action was to confront the other mom because their daughter wasn't included. The key points here are the intent and the method used.\n\nThe parent's intention was likely to advocate for their child's inclusion, which is a valid concern. However, the approach was to yell at the other mother, which might not be the best way to handle the situation. Publicly confronting someone can be seen as aggressive, even if the underlying issue is important. The mother might feel embarrassed or defensive, which could explain her reaction of storming off. \n\nBut then again, the parent's concern is about their child's inclusion and social interaction. People with disabilities often face exclusion, and advocating for them is important. However, the method of confrontation here was direct and public, which might escalate the situation. It's possible that the other mother didn't realize the daughter was being excluded, or maybe there was another reason for not including her.\n\nI should also consider if there's a cultural or social norm where yelling in such situations is more acceptable. But generally, yelling can be seen as aggressive. The partner's opinion that the parent overreacted adds another layer, suggesting that maybe there's a different perspective within their own household.\n\nSo, the parent's actions were driven by a good intention, but the method used was confrontational. It's a balance between advocating for one's child and how that advocacy is executed. The other mother's reaction (storming off) might indicate that she felt attacked, which could have been avoided with a more private and calm approach.\n\nTherefore, while the parent's concern is valid, the way they handled it could be seen as inconsiderate. The answer might lean towards the parent being in the wrong because of the method, even if the intent was good.\n"
