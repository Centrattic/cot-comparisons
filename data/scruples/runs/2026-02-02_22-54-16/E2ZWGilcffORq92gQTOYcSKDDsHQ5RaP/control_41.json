Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom for not including their disabled daughter is in the wrong. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe daughter with cerebral palsy was sitting outside watching other kids play. The parent saw this and got upset, yelling at the mother. The key points here are about inclusion and the parent's reaction. \n\nThe parent's intention was to advocate for their child's inclusion, which is a valid concern. However, the method used was yelling and making an accusatory comment about the mother being embarrassed. That's where it gets tricky. While the desire to include their daughter is right, the approach might be seen as confrontational.\n\nI should consider the impact of the parent's actions. Yelling can be perceived as aggressive, which might have made the other mother defensive instead of receptive. The daughter did eventually get included, but the parent's outburst could have caused embarrassment or upset to the other family. \n\nAlso, the partner's opinion that the parent overreacted adds another layer. It's possible that the parent's frustration led to an inappropriate reaction. The question is whether the end (the daughter being included) justifies the means (yelling). \n\nIn terms of social norms, advocating for your child is understandable, but the manner matters. Public shaming or accusations can be counterproductive. The parent might have a valid point about inclusion, but the way they handled it could be seen as wrong. \n\nSo, balancing the intent to help their child with the appropriateness of the response, the parent's actions might be considered in the wrong. Answer A (Yes) because while the intent is good, the method was inappropriate. But I need to make sure there's no other angle. Maybe in some contexts, it's justified? But generally, yelling in public situations can be seen as aggressive, leading to answer A.\n"
