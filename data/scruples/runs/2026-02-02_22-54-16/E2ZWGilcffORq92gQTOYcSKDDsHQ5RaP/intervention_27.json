Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (or their partner) is in the wrong for yelling at kids and their mom for not including their disabled daughter in play. The daughter has cerebral palsy and was sitting on the veranda watching the other kids play. The author confronts the mother, first asking if she's embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid, then adds that the daughter isn't poisonous. The mother reacts by storming off, and the daughter ends up being included later.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is the author in the wrong? The user thinks they're not, but wants others' opinions. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is disabled and was excluded from play, which can be hurtful. The author's intent was to advocate for their child's inclusion. However, the method used was yelling at the mother, which might be seen as aggressive or confrontational. \n\nPossible angles to consider: \n1. Advocacy vs. aggression: Is it okay to confront someone to ensure inclusion, or should the approach be more diplomatic?\n2. Public shaming: Did the author's actions shame the mother in front of others, which could have the opposite effect of encouraging inclusion?\n3. The mother's reaction: Maybe she was unaware of the exclusion or had reasons not to include the child initially. The author's approach might have forced the issue, leading to a defensive reaction.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter's feelings matter. Being excluded can be painful, and the parent might feel strongly about ensuring their child is included. The author's outburst might have been a result of frustration and love for their child. \n\nBut yelling in public could be seen as unprofessional or inconsiderate. The mother might feel attacked, which could create tension. Also, the subsequent inclusion by the kids after the confrontation suggests that maybe the initial exclusion was a misunderstanding or temporary oversight. \n\nIn these situations, different people might have different views. Some might support the parent for standing up for their child, others might think that yelling is not the appropriate way to handle it. The key is whether the method was justified by the intent. \n\nI think the answer hinges on the balance between the parent's responsibility to advocate for their child and the social approach taken. While the intent was good, the method of confrontation (yelling) might be problematic. So the author could be seen as in the wrong because they chose an aggressive approach instead of a calmer, more respectful one. However, others might argue that the situation warranted immediate action to prevent exclusion. \n\nBut given that the daughter was included afterward, maybe the author's actions had a positive outcome. Still, the manner in which they addressed the mother could have been handled better. So, the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because yelling is not the appropriate response, even if the intent was good. Alternatively, B (no) if the intent is considered more important than the method. \n\nI need to decide based on the community's typical reactions. In AITA scenarios, people often judge based on both intent and action. Yelling is usually frowned upon, but if it was to correct a harmful behavior (like exclusion of a disabled child), there might be more leniency. However, the author could have approached the mother more privately or calmly. \n\nSo, considering that the author's approach was confrontational in public, even if the intent was good, they might be at fault. The mother's initial exclusion might not be intentional, and yelling could have made her defensive. The partner thinking they overreacted is a sign that the method was too harsh. Therefore, the answer is probably A.\n"
