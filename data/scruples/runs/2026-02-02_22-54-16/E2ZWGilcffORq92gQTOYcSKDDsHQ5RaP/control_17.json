Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at some kids' mom because they didn't include their disabled daughter in their play. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The daughter wants to join the kids playing ball, but the other kids and their mom are ignoring her. The parent (the author) gets upset and yells at the mom, accusing her of being embarrassed because their daughter is disabled. Then the kids end up including the daughter after a while.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about inclusion and the parent's reaction. The author's intent was to protect their daughter and advocate for her inclusion. But the method used was yelling at another parent, which could be seen as confrontational and maybe hurtful.\n\nI need to consider if yelling was the right approach. While the parent's concern is valid\u2014ensuring their child isn't excluded\u2014the way they handled it might have been inappropriate. Yelling at another parent in public could escalate the situation and potentially make the other parent defensive, which might not encourage inclusion in the future. The other mom might feel attacked, leading to tension between the families.\n\nAlso, the daughter did eventually get included after the parent went inside and came back out. That suggests that maybe a calmer approach, like talking to the kids directly or involving the other mom in a more constructive way, could have been better. However, the parent's frustration is understandable given the desire to include their daughter.\n\nOn the flip side, the parent's action led to inclusion, so there's a positive outcome. But the method was aggressive. People might argue that advocating for a child's inclusion is right, but the manner in which it was done matters. The key question is whether the parent overstepped by yelling, which could be seen as inconsiderate to the other parent's perspective.\n\nIn terms of social norms, public yelling is generally frowned upon, especially when it accuses someone of having negative intentions (like being embarrassed by a disabled child). Even if the parent's intention was good, the public confrontation might have been unproductive and damaging to community relations.\n\nSo, balancing the intent to include the child with the method used, the parent might be in the wrong for how they handled it, even though their intention was to help their daughter. The answer could be A (they're in the wrong) because the approach was inappropriate, even if the concern was valid.\n"
