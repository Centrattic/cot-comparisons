Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids for not including their disabled daughter is in the wrong. The situation is that their daughter was sitting outside watching other kids play, and the parent got upset and yelled at the mother of the kids. The daughter was eventually included, but the parent is now being called out for their reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intent. Their daughter has a disability, and they want her to be included. The parent might feel frustrated or hurt that the other kids didn't include her, especially if exclusion is a recurring issue. Yelling in the moment could be an emotional reaction to that frustration.\n\nBut then, yelling at another parent in public could be seen as aggressive. The mother might not have realized her kids weren't including the daughter, or she might have been unaware of the situation. The parent's approach might have been confrontational, which could escalate the situation instead of fostering understanding. However, the parent's intention was to advocate for their child's inclusion, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe daughter ended up being included after the incident, which is a positive outcome. The parent's partner thinks they overreacted, which adds another perspective. The parent might have felt that a direct approach was necessary to address the immediate exclusion.\n\nI should also consider social norms and expectations. While advocating for inclusion is important, the method of addressing the issue matters. Yelling might not be the most effective way to communicate and could potentially make the other parent defensive, hindering future interactions.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the parent's actions were driven by a desire to protect and include their child, but the method used could be questioned. There might be a better way to handle the situation without public confrontation, such as talking to the other parent calmly or addressing it with the children involved.\n\nSo, balancing the intent and the method, the parent's actions were motivated by a good cause but executed in a way that might not be the most constructive. Therefore, the parent could be seen as partially at fault for how they handled the situation, even if their intentions were right.\n"
