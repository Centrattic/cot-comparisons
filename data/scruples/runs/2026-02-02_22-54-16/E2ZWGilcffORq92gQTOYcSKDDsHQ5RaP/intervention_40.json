Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at the kids' mom because their daughter wasn't included in the play. The situation involves a disabled child, specifically with cerebral palsy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The writer's daughter was sitting on the veranda watching the kids play. The writer approached the other mother and yelled, questioning if she was embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. Then followed up with a comment about cerebral palsy and the mother storming off. The daughter eventually got included later.\n\nNow, the key points here are the intent and the method. The writer's motivation was to advocate for their daughter, which is understandable. However, the approach was confrontational and public, using yelling and accusatory language. The other mother might have been taken off guard, and the situation could have been handled differently. \n\nOn one hand, advocating for inclusion is important, especially for a child who might feel excluded. On the other hand, yelling at someone else's parent could be seen as aggressive and potentially escalate the situation. The partner thought it was overreacting, which makes sense because yelling might not be the best way to encourage positive interaction. The daughter did end up included later, maybe because the kids noticed and decided to include her, but it's unclear if the writer's outburst was the reason or if it was a coincidence.\n\nAlso, the writer's comment about cerebral palsy could come off as defensive or dismissive. It's important to balance standing up for one's child with respecting others' boundaries. Public confrontations might not effectively address the root issue and could make people defensive, leading to avoidance in the future.\n\nSo, while the intent was good, the method might be questionable. The writer might be in the right in wanting to include their daughter, but the approach could have been better. Therefore, the answer hinges on whether the method justifies the intent. Some might say the writer is not in the wrong because they were protecting their child, others might argue that the way they did it was wrong. The community's view on AITA is often about whether the action is appropriate even if the motivation is good.\n"
