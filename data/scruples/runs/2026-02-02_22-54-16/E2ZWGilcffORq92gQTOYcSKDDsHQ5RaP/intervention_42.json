Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids for not including their disabled daughter is in the wrong. First, I need to consider the context. The daughter has cerebral palsy, which might affect her mobility or participation. The parent saw their daughter excluded from a game and acted impulsively.\n\nThe parent's actions involved yelling at the mother, which could be seen as aggressive. Even if the parent's intention was to advocate for their child, using confrontational language might not be the best approach. The mother of the other kids might have been unaware of the exclusion or had other reasons. The parent's statement about being embarrassed could have been hurtful, even if unintended.\n\nThe daughter eventually was included, which is positive. However, the method used to address the situation might have caused more harm. The partner's reaction suggests they felt it was an overreaction, which is a red flag. While the parent's concern is valid, yelling might not be the most effective way to handle such situations. It's possible that approaching the mother calmly could have achieved the same result without the conflict. So, considering the method versus the intent, the parent might be in the wrong.\n"
