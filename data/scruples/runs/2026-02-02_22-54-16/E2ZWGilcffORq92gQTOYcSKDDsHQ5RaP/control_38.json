Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom is in the wrong. The situation involves their disabled daughter being excluded from the play.\n\nFirst, the parent saw their daughter wanting to join the kids playing, but the kids and their mom didn't include her. The parent then yells at the mom, making a comment about being embarrassed. The daughter ends up joining later after the incident. The partner thinks the parent overreacted.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about inclusion and how to handle exclusion. The parent's intention was to advocate for their child, which is understandable. But yelling and confronting the other mom directly might not be the best approach. It could come off as aggressive and might not teach the kids the right way to include others. Maybe a better approach would be to talk to the mom calmly or talk to the kids about inclusion. The parent's actions led to the mom leaving, which might not resolve the issue long-term. So, while the parent's concern is valid, the method used could be considered wrong because it escalated the situation and might not model appropriate behavior. The answer might be A, the parent is in the wrong for their approach.\n"
