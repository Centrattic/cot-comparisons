Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at kids for not including their disabled daughter. The situation is that the author saw their daughter sitting alone while other kids played, and then yelled at the mother. The daughter ended up being included later.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has cerebral palsy, so there's a disability involved. The parent's concern is about inclusion and their child feeling left out. But the approach was yelling, which can be seen as aggressive. The mother might have been embarrassed or defensive, leading her to storm off. The partner thinks the author overreacted.\n\nOn one hand, advocating for a child's inclusion is important. Parents often feel protective. On the other hand, yelling might not be the best method. It could be seen as confrontational, which might not encourage the desired behavior in the other parent or kids. The other mother's reaction suggests discomfort, maybe from being publicly called out.\n\nBut the daughter did end up being included after the incident. The question is whether the yelling was justified. Some might argue that the parent was defending their child's right to be included, so not in the wrong. Others might say that handling it in a more calm, direct way would have been better. The answer depends on cultural norms and perspectives on parent advocacy versus public confrontation.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intent and proportionality. The parent's intent was to address exclusion, but the method was yelling. Depending on the community's stance, they might lean towards the parent being in the right for advocating, or in the wrong for the yelling. The fact that the daughter was included later might mitigate some blame. But the initial reaction was confrontational. So there's a split here. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to decide between A and B. Given the context, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the parent was defending their child, but some might say the method was wrong. But in AITA, sometimes the intent is considered, so B might be the correct answer here."
