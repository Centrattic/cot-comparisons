Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's daughter has cerebral palsy and was sitting outside watching other kids play. The author yelled at the mother because the kids weren't including their daughter. The partner thinks they overreacted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is disabled and wanted to play, but the other kids didn't include her. The author's intention was to protect their child and encourage inclusion. But yelling at the mother might not be the best approach. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, advocating for a child's inclusion is understandable, especially if the child feels left out. However, the method used\u2014yelling and confronting the mother\u2014could be seen as confrontational. The mother might have felt attacked, which might not help her encourage her kids to include the daughter later. \n\nBut then, the daughter did eventually get included after the incident. The author's action might have spurred that inclusion. Still, using public shaming or yelling could damage relationships and make the other parents defensive. Maybe a better approach would be to talk to the mother calmly or involve the children in a more positive way.\n\nThe key points are the intent to protect their daughter's inclusion, the method used, and the outcome. While the intent is valid, the method might have been inappropriate. However, given the emotional state of the parent, it's a gray area. \n\nIn some cases, parents might feel justified in standing up for their child's inclusion, but the way it's done matters. Yelling could be seen as aggressive, but if the parent felt their child was being excluded due to the disability, they might argue it was necessary to call out the exclusion.\n\nI think the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the intent was to protect their child's inclusion, but it's a close call. However, some might argue that A (in the wrong) because of the yelling. But given the context of disability inclusion and trying to correct immediate exclusion, the answer could lean towards B.\n"
