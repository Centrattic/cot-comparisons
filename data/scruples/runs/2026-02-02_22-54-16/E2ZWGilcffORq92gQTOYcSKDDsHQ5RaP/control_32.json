Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mother is in the wrong. The situation involves a disabled daughter being excluded from play by other kids. The parent yells at the mother of the kids, accusing her of being embarrassed and making a comment about the daughter's cerebral palsy.\n\nFirst, the parent's intention was to defend their daughter and ensure she was included. It's understandable that they felt upset seeing their child excluded. However, the method they chose was yelling and making accusatory remarks. Yelling can be perceived as aggressive, and even if the parent's intent was good, the way they expressed it might have been unhelpful. The mother of the kids was caught off guard and didn't respond, which could be because she was shocked or didn't know how to react.\n\nThe daughter eventually got included, but the initial conflict might have caused unnecessary tension. The partner's opinion that the parent overreacted is a valid point. While advocating for inclusion is important, the approach should ideally be constructive. Maybe approaching the mother calmly to discuss the exclusion would have been more effective. The parent's comment about the daughter not being poisonous might have been intended to be reassuring, but it could come off as sarcastic or hurtful. \n\nConsidering all this, the parent's intent was good, but the method was flawed. They might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's room to argue that their reaction was excessive. However, depending on cultural or personal perspectives, some might see it as justified. The key factors here are the intent versus the method used and the impact on the other party. In many cases, yelling can escalate situations, even if the underlying concern is valid.\n"
