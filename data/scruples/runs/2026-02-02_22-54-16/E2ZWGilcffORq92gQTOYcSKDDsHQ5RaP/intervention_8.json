Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids and their mom for not including their disabled daughter was in the wrong. The story says the author saw their daughter sitting alone while other kids were playing. They confronted the mother through yelling, which made the kids include the daughter eventually.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the author. They were defending their child's right to be included, especially since the child has a disability. The mother might have been unaware of the situation or didn't realize the child wanted to join. The author's frustration is understandable, wanting their child to feel accepted.\n\nBut then, there's the method used. Yelling at the mother could be seen as aggressive. Even if the intention was to help the child, shouting might have been public shaming, which can be hurtful and counterproductive. The mother might need to be approached in a calmer, more private way to address the issue. The author's partner thinks they overreacted, which adds another layer of conflict within the family.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter ended up being included after the confrontation. So, maybe the yelling had the desired effect. But was it the right approach? The key here is balancing the child's needs with respectful communication. Yelling might not set a good example for the daughter either, teaching her that aggression is the solution.\n\nAlso, the mother's reaction\u2014storming off into the caravan\u2014suggests that the confrontation was uncomfortable and possibly damaging to relationships. It's possible that the mother had good reasons for not including the child, like not knowing how to interact, but the author's approach didn't allow for that explanation.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while advocating for inclusion is important, the method matters. Public shaming, even if well-intentioned, can alienate others and create defensiveness rather than cooperation. The partner's opinion that it was an overreaction might indicate that the community might not support such a confrontational approach.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's intention was to protect their child, but the method used was inappropriate. Hence, the answer would be A (yes, they are in the wrong) because yelling is an aggressive approach that might not foster the desired long-term inclusion and could damage relationships. However, if the focus is solely on the child's right to be included, it's a gray area. But generally, the manner in which they acted is where the fault lies.\n"
