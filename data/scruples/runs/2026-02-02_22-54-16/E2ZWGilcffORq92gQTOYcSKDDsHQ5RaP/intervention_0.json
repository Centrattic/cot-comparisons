Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at the kids' mom because they excluded the author's disabled daughter.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's daughter was sitting outside watching other kids play, and when they noticed this, they yelled at the mother. The daughter then got included later. The partner thinks they overreacted.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether yelling was the right response. On one hand, excluding a child, especially a disabled one, can be hurtful. The author might feel protective and frustrated, thinking the kids are being mean. On the other hand, yelling at the mother might not be the best approach. It could come off as confrontational, and maybe the mother wasn't aware of the exclusion, or maybe there was another reason the kids weren't inviting the daughter to play. \n\nThe author's actions led to the mother leaving, which might not have been helpful. Also, the daughter ended up joining the kids later, so maybe the exclusion wasn't intentional, or the kids were just shy. Yelling might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. The partner's reaction suggests that maybe there's a different perspective on how to handle such situations, perhaps more calmly.\n\nBut considering the emotional aspect, it's understandable that a parent would be upset if their child is excluded. The author's intention was likely to advocate for their daughter. However, the method of confrontation might not be the most effective. There's a balance between standing up for one's child and maintaining a respectful approach that fosters inclusion without hostility.\n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the yelling was justified. If the exclusion was intentional and mean-spirited, the author's reaction could be seen as justified. But if there was a misunderstanding or if the kids were just not aware, then the yelling might have been an overreaction. Since the kids did include the daughter later, maybe the initial exclusion wasn't malicious. The mother's reaction to the yelling and leaving could also affect how the situation is viewed. \n\nIn terms of social norms, direct confrontation in public can be seen as inconsiderate, even if the underlying concern is valid. The author might be in the right in wanting inclusion but in the wrong in how they handled it. So, the answer would lean towards A (in the wrong) because the approach was confrontational and might not have been the best way to address the situation.\n"
