Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for yelling at kids for not including their disabled daughter. The scenario is that the author sees their daughter sitting alone while other kids are playing. They yell at the mother, accusing her of being embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. The daughter then moves closer, the kids include her, but the mother storms off. The partner thinks the author overreacted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle. The author's intention was to advocate for their daughter, ensuring she's included. That's a valid concern. However, the method used was yelling at the mother, which can be seen as confrontational. Even if the intent was good, the approach might have been harsh. The mother might have had different reasons for the kids not including the daughter, maybe not intentional exclusion. Yelling could have escalated the situation and made the mother defensive, which might not help the daughter's inclusion in the future.\n\nAlso, the daughter ended up included eventually, but maybe there were better ways to handle it. The partner's opinion that it was an overreaction adds another perspective. Publicly confronting someone can be hurtful, even if the underlying issue is valid. The key here is whether the action was proportionate. The author wanted inclusion but used a method that might have been counterproductive. So while the intent is understandable, the method might be questionable. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
