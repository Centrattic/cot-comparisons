Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a parent yelling at another kid's mom because their disabled daughter wasn't included in play. The author's daughter was sitting nearby, watching, and the author decided to confront the mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has cerebral palsy, which is a physical disability. The other kids were playing, but she wasn't included. The author, feeling that exclusion is happening, yells at the mother, implying that maybe the mother is embarrassed to be seen with a disabled child. The mother is shocked and leaves, but eventually the kids do include the daughter after she goes back out.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, advocating for inclusion is important. It's right to want your child to be included and to address exclusion. But the way the author did it was by yelling at the mother, which could be seen as confrontational. The author's words were harsh, even if the intent was to defend their child. The mother might have had reasons unrelated to the child's disability for not including her. Maybe the kids were playing a game that didn't allow for more players, or the mother was distracted. The author didn't give her a chance to explain before making an accusation.\n\nHowever, from the author's perspective, they might feel that their child's exclusion is due to the disability, and they're standing up for her. The mother's shock and leaving without a response might suggest that the accusation was unexpected and possibly hurtful. But the daughter did end up being included later, so maybe the situation resolved itself.\n\nIn terms of social norms, yelling in public can be seen as aggressive and might not be the best approach. It could damage relationships or make the other parent defensive. The author's partner thinks they overreacted, which is a sign that maybe the approach was too intense. However, the parent's intention was to protect their child's feelings and promote inclusion, which is a valid concern.\n\nSo, balancing the intent to include against the method used. The right intention doesn't necessarily justify an aggressive method. The author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to help their child, but they could be in the wrong for the way they handled it. However, given the context of defending a child from possible discrimination, some might argue it's justified. It's a bit of a grey area. But considering that the author acted in the moment and the daughter was included later, maybe the answer is that they're not in the wrong. But others might say that yelling was the wrong approach regardless.\n"
