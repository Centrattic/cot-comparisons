Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're at fault for yelling at kids who didn't include their disabled daughter in the game. The situation is that the daughter was sitting outside watching other kids play, and the parent got angry and shouted at the mother. The kids eventually included the daughter after the incident.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intentions. They wanted their child to be included, which is a valid concern. But the method used was yelling at the other mother, which could be seen as aggressive. The parent might have felt frustrated and acted impulsively rather than approaching the situation calmly.\n\nThen, there's the impact of the yelling. The other mother was shocked and left, which might have been hurtful. The daughter ended up included later, but the parent's actions might have caused embarrassment or tension. The partner thinks they overreacted, which adds another perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent was trying to protect their child's feelings and promote inclusion. However, yelling in public and confronting the mother that way might not have been the best approach. Maybe a calmer approach, like talking to the mother privately, would have been better. The parent's actions could have been perceived as confrontational rather than helpful.\n\nAlso, the daughter's ability to join in after the incident shows that the kids were willing to include her eventually. So maybe the yelling wasn't necessary. The parent's frustration is understandable, but the method used might have been inappropriate. So, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong because yelling was an overreaction and not the best way to handle the situation.\n"
