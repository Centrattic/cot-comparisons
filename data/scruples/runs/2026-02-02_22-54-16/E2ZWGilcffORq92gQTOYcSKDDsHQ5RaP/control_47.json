Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for yelling at kids for not including their disabled daughter. The situation is that the parent saw their daughter excluded from a game of ball by two kids and their mother. They yelled at the mother, implying she was embarrassed to have a disabled child. The daughter later joined the kids, but the parent is now getting criticism from their partner for overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intent. They were trying to protect their daughter's feelings and advocate for her inclusion. Excluding a child, especially one with a disability, can be hurtful, and parents often want to ensure their kids feel included. The parent's frustration is understandable, but the method of addressing the issue was through yelling and making an accusatory comment. That could be seen as confrontational and possibly shaming the other mother.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother might not have been aware of the exclusion. Maybe she didn't notice that the other kids weren't including the daughter. If the parent had approached the mother calmly to explain the situation first, it might have been more effective. Yelling might have escalated the situation and made the other parent defensive. However, the parent's daughter did end up being included, so maybe the yelling had a positive outcome, but that's not a justification for the method used.\n\nThe partner's opinion that the parent overreacted suggests that there's a perspective where direct, public confrontation without first trying to communicate is excessive. The parent could have addressed the issue in a way that's less confrontational, like talking to the mother privately or encouraging the children themselves. The key point is whether the parent's actions were an appropriate response given the circumstances.\n\nIn terms of ethics, advocating for inclusion is right, but the method matters. Yelling in public and making assumptions about the other parent's feelings (like being embarrassed) could come across as accusatory and disrespectful. It's possible that the parent was trying to do the right thing but used the wrong approach. So, the parent might be in the wrong because of how they handled the situation rather than the intent. The answer is likely A (the parent is in the wrong) because the approach was confrontational and unkind, even if the intent was good.\n"
