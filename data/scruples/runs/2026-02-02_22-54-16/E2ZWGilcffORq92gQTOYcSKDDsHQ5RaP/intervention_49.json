Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who yelled at the kids and their mother for excluding their disabled daughter is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent (the author) seeing their daughter left out of a game by other kids, even though the daughter was there and wanted to join. The author yells at the mother, which leads to the mother leaving and the kids eventually including the daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intent. The parent's main concern is their daughter's inclusion and social interaction. Children with disabilities often face exclusion, and the parent might feel that standing up for their child is necessary. However, the method used here was yelling at the mother, which can be seen as aggressive and confrontational.\n\nNext, the mother's reaction. The mother was \"gobsmacked\" and left, which suggests she was taken aback by the accusation of being embarrassed. It's unclear if the mother was intentionally excluding the child. Maybe she didn't notice or didn't know how to include her. The parent's outburst might have been a poor way to handle it, especially in public and in front of the kids.\n\nThe daughter did end up joining the game later, which is positive. But the parent's approach might have damaged the interaction with the other family. Yelling can escalate tensions and might not teach the kids the right way to include others. The partner's opinion that the parent overreacted adds another layer, indicating that there's a perspective that a calmer approach could have been more effective.\n\nLegally and ethically, the parent has a right to advocate for their child. However, the method of advocacy affects the outcome. Yelling might not be the best strategy, especially in a public setting where it can lead to embarrassment and hostility. Alternative actions, like approaching the mother calmly, could have addressed the issue without causing a scene.\n\nAlso, the term \"disabled kid\" is considered a bit dated now; \"person with a disability\" is preferred. The parent's comment about the child not being \"poisonous\" might come off as defensive or sarcastic, which could have been hurtful.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intention was to protect their child's inclusion, the method was inappropriate. The aggressive approach likely caused more harm than good, even if the outcome was the daughter being included later. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for the way they handled the situation.\n"
