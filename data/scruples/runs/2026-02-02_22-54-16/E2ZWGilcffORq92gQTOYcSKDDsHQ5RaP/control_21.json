Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about their disabled daughter not being included in a game by other kids, and the parent yelling at the other mother.\n\nFirst, the daughter is sitting outside watching the kids play. The parent sees this and gets upset. The parent yells out to the other mother, implying she's embarrassed to be seen with a disabled child. Then the parent makes another comment about cerebral palsy, which leads to the other mum leaving. The partner thinks the parent overreacted.\n\nSo, the key points here are about protecting the daughter's inclusion and the method used to address it. The parent's intention is to advocate for their daughter, which is understandable. But yelling and making confrontational comments might not be the best approach. Public shaming or confrontation could be seen as aggressive, even if coming from a place of concern. However, the other mother might have been neglectful in not including the child. But the parent's response could have been more constructive, like approaching the mother calmly to discuss inclusion. The daughter eventually gets included, so maybe the parent's actions had an effect, but the method was harsh. It's a tricky balance between standing up for your child and handling the situation respectfully. So, the parent might not be entirely in the wrong, but could have handled it better. The answer might be B, but there's nuance.\n"
