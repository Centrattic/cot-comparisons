Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a parent who yelled at other kids and their mother because their disabled daughter wasn't included in a game. The parent's daughter has cerebral palsy and was sitting on the veranda watching the kids play. The parent then yelled at the mother, asking if she was embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid, and made some other comments. The kids eventually included the daughter after the incident.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. Yelling at someone is a strong reaction. On one hand, the parent's concern for their daughter's inclusion is valid. Children with disabilities often face social exclusion, and advocating for their inclusion is important. But yelling in public could be seen as confrontational and might have made the other mother defensive, which might have led to the other mother walking away instead of engaging. \n\nThe parent's approach might have been more effective if they had calmly addressed the situation, perhaps by talking to the mother directly in a non-confrontational way. Yelling could escalate the situation and potentially teach the daughter that yelling is an appropriate response, or it might make the other children and mother feel attacked rather than corrected.\n\nHowever, the parent's intention was to protect their child's feelings and promote inclusion. The other mother didn't respond, which might indicate she was upset or didn't know how to handle the situation. The kids did eventually include the daughter, so maybe their actions had a positive outcome. But the method used\u2014publicly confronting the mother\u2014might have been counterproductive. \n\nIt's also important to consider cultural and social norms. In some contexts, a parent might feel justified in standing up for their child's inclusion, but the method of intervention can affect the outcome. The partner's opinion that the parent overreacted adds another layer, suggesting that the reaction might not have been the best approach.\n\nSo, balancing intent and method, the parent's intention is good, but the method (yelling) might be the issue. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for how they handled the situation, even if their motivation was to protect their daughter.\n"
