Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for yelling at kids because they didn't include their disabled daughter in a play session. The situation involves a parent (the author) witnessing their daughter being excluded and reacting strongly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has cerebral palsy, and the author sees other kids playing while she's sitting alone. The parent yells at the other mother, which caused the mother to leave. The daughter then goes back and the kids include her. The partner thinks the author overreacted.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the parent's reaction was justified. On one hand, the parent was trying to protect their child and encourage inclusion. Exclusion based on a disability is a serious issue, and the parent's frustration is understandable. They might feel that their child is being treated unfairly, and the yelling was an emotional response to that exclusion.\n\nOn the other hand, yelling at another parent could be seen as inappropriate. It's possible that the other mother wasn't aware of the exclusion, or that the children were just playing and didn't realize they were excluding someone. The parent's public confrontation might have been harsh and could have made the other mother defensive, leading to the situation escalating.\n\nThe daughter eventually was included, so maybe the yelling had an effect, but confrontation isn't always the best approach. However, the intent was to advocate for their child's inclusion, which is a valid concern. The line between standing up for your child and overreacting can be thin here.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while advocating for inclusion is important, doing so in a confrontational manner might not be the best approach. The parent could have approached the other mother calmly to discuss the situation instead of yelling. Yelling might come off as aggressive and could lead to the other parent becoming defensive, which might not help the daughter's integration in the long run.\n\nBut considering the emotional aspect, the parent was likely upset because their child was being excluded. They might not have had a calm moment to think through the best approach in the heat of the moment. It's a tough balance between protecting their child's feelings and handling the situation with the other parents respectfully.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the parent's intention was good\u2014to promote inclusion and protect their child. However, the method used (yelling) could be seen as inconsiderate and potentially counterproductive. The other mother's reaction suggests that the approach might not have been effective in the moment. Therefore, while the parent's concern is valid, the way they addressed it might be where they could have acted differently.\n"
