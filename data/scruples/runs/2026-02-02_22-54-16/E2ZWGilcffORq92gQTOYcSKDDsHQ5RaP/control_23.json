Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. So the situation is that the author's daughter is disabled and sitting outside watching other kids play. The author yells at the kids' mom for not including their daughter. Then the kids eventually include the daughter after the mom leaves. The partner thinks the author overreacted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has cerebral palsy, which might make inclusion more challenging, but it's not impossible. The author's intent was to advocate for their child, right? They wanted the other kids to include their daughter. But the method was yelling at the mother. That could be seen as aggressive or confrontational. \n\nOn one hand, the author is defending their child's right to be included, which is a valid concern. Parental instinct to protect and advocate for a child, especially one with disabilities, is strong. The mother might have been unaware of her child's exclusion, so the author's intervention could be justified in ensuring inclusion.\n\nOn the other hand, yelling at the mother might have been an aggressive approach. It's possible that the mother wasn't intentionally excluding the child. Maybe the kids were just playing and didn't realize they weren't including her. Yelling could escalate the situation and make the mother defensive, leading her to walk away without resolving the issue. The author's partner thinks they overreacted, which adds a layer of personal conflict.\n\nAnother angle: the daughter ended up being included after the mom left, so maybe the yelling was effective in the end. But was it the right way? The author's approach might have caused embarrassment to the other mother, which is not ideal. Communication strategies matter. Instead of yelling, maybe approaching the mother calmly to discuss inclusion could have been better. \n\nAlso, public confrontation can be intimidating. The author might have felt that their child was being excluded, but the method of addressing it could have been more constructive. However, in the heat of the moment, emotions can lead to reactive actions. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, advocating for inclusion is important, but the method should respect others' dignity. The author's comment about the mother being embarrassed could have been hurtful. The line between defending one's child and being confrontational is thin here.\n\nSo, considering all these points: the intent was good (ensuring inclusion), the method was aggressive (yelling publicly), the result was the daughter being included eventually. The author might not be entirely wrong, but the approach could have been better. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. \n\nIf the answer hinges on whether yelling was the right method, then maybe the author is in the wrong because yelling isn't an effective or respectful way to address the situation. Alternatively, if the intent is excused due to the desire to protect the child, perhaps the answer is no. \n\nBut generally, in such scenarios, while the intent is understandable, the public confrontation and yelling could be seen as overreacting. So the answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong). However, some people might argue that the author's actions were justified in advocating for their child. It's a bit of a gray area. But since the partner thinks they overreacted, and the method was confrontational, the answer might lean towards A.\n"
