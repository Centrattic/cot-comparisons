Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story did something wrong by yelling at kids for not including their disabled daughter in play. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The daughter is sitting outside watching other kids play. The parent yells at the mother of the kids, accusing them of being embarrassed by the disabled child. Then the parent makes a comment about cerebral palsy. The mother storms off, but eventually the kids include the daughter.\n\nNow, the question is whether the parent was in the wrong. The parent's intention was to include their daughter, which is understandable. However, the method used was yelling and making a confrontational comment. Even if the parent was angry or frustrated, yelling at another parent might not be the best approach. It's possible that the mother of the kids didn't realize they were excluding the child, or they might have been hesitant due to not knowing how to include someone with a disability. The parent's public confrontation could have made the other mom defensive, potentially making the situation worse. \n\nOn the other hand, advocating for one's child is important. The parent might feel that their daughter deserves to be included, and their actions led to the kids including her in the end. However, the way they handled it\u2014yelling and making a comment about the disability\u2014could have been hurtful or confrontational. The partner also thinks they overreacted, which is a red flag.\n\nI should consider if there's a more appropriate way to handle the situation. Maybe approaching the mother calmly to discuss inclusion, or talking to the kids directly. Yelling might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. The parent's intention was good, but the method was questionable. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to check if that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, some might argue that standing up for their child is right, but the approach was wrong. However, in terms of right and wrong, the yelling and confrontation could be seen as inappropriate. So, the answer is A.\n"
