Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for yelling at the kids for not including their disabled daughter. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the daughter is disabled, specifically with cerebral palsy. She was sitting outside watching other kids play. The parent (the author) noticed this and decided to confront the mother of the kids playing. The author yelled at the mother, asking if she was embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. Then added that it's just cerebral palsy and the kid isn't poisonous. The mother got upset and left, but the daughter ended up being included later.\n\nSo the question is, was the author in the wrong for yelling? Let's think about the options. \n\nOn one hand, the parent was trying to protect their child's feelings and ensure she was included. Exclusion can be hurtful, especially for a child with disabilities who might already face challenges. The parent's frustration is understandable. However, yelling and confronting the other mother in that way might not have been the best approach. The mother might have been unaware of the situation or could have had valid reasons for not inviting the child. Publicly confronting someone like that could be seen as aggressive and might not encourage positive interaction in the future. \n\nAlso, the other mother's reaction\u2014storming off\u2014suggests that the approach was off-putting. Maybe a better way would be to talk to the mother privately, or involve the partner first. The parent's partner thinks they overreacted, which adds another perspective. However, the parent's intention was to advocate for their child, which is a valid concern. \n\nSo, is the parent at fault? They had good intentions, but the method used was confrontational. The line between advocacy and aggression can be thin. In terms of social norms, yelling in public can be seen as inconsiderate, even if the motive is good. The key issue is whether the parent had the right to confront the other mother in such a public and harsh manner. \n\nOn the other side, the daughter did end up being included eventually, so maybe the yelling had some effect. But the way it was handled could have damaged relationships. The answer might depend on cultural context or personal values, but in general, public confrontation is often discouraged in favor of more diplomatic approaches. \n\nI think the parent's actions were a bit of a middle ground. They were right to want inclusion but wrong in how they enforced it. Therefore, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong) because the method was inappropriate even if the intent was good.\n"
