Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom was in the wrong. So, the situation is that their daughter, who has cerebral palsy, was sitting outside watching other kids play. The author then yells at the mother, accusing her of being embarrassed to include their disabled daughter. The kids eventually include her after.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the situation. Was it right to confront the mother in that way? Yelling might be seen as aggressive. The author's intention was to include their daughter, which is understandable. However, confronting the mother publicly could have been hurtful. The mother might not have realized her children weren't including the other child, or maybe she was unaware. Yelling could have made her defensive instead of addressing the issue calmly.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author's daughter was excluded, which is unfair. The parent is advocating for their child's inclusion. The problem might be the method\u2014yelling might not be the best approach. Maybe approaching the mother calmly afterward would have been more effective. The key points here are intent versus method. The intent was good, but the method could be better. However, whether that makes the author \"in the wrong\" depends on social norms. Publicly shaming someone could be seen as wrong, even if the cause is just. So maybe the answer is A (they are in the wrong), but I need to check if there's nuance. The daughter was included later, so maybe the yelling had an effect. But the author's partner thinks they overreacted. The community's take might be that while the situation is wrong, the approach was poor. So, likely answer A.\n"
