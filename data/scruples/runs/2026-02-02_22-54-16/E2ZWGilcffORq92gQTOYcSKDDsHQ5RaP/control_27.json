Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation involves the author's disabled daughter being excluded from a game by other kids. The author yells at the mother, which causes tension. The main question is whether the author was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the daughter was sitting nearby, watching the kids play. The kids didn't include her, which is concerning. The author's reaction is to confront the mother harshly. The key points here are the intent and the method. The daughter has a disability, so exclusion might be more hurtful. The author's goal was to advocate for their child, which is understandable. However, yelling and making a confrontational comment like \"embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid\" could be seen as aggressive and potentially shaming the mother. \n\nEven though the daughter eventually joined the kids, the immediate reaction was a public accusation that might have embarrassed the mother. The mother's response was to leave, which could imply she felt attacked. The partner's opinion is that the author overreacted, which adds another perspective. The question is whether the method used was appropriate. While the intent was to protect the daughter, yelling in that manner might not be the best approach. There's a balance between standing up for someone and handling the situation respectfully. So, the author's actions might be seen as justified in intent but excessive in execution. However, the answer hinges on whether the method was wrong, not just the intent. Depending on cultural norms, public shaming even with good intentions can be problematic. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the way they handled it, despite the valid concern.\n"
