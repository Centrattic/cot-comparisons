Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to unpack this. The user is asking whether the person who yelled at the kids' mom was in the wrong. The parent saw their disabled daughter sitting alone while other kids played and then yelled at the mother, saying things like \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid?\" and \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has cerebral palsy, and she was sitting on the veranda watching the kids play. The parent felt excluded and took action. The key here is whether yelling was an appropriate response. \n\nOn one hand, including children with disabilities is important. The parent's concern for their daughter's inclusion is valid. The mother might have felt that the other kids or their parent were excluding her daughter intentionally. Yelling, though, can be seen as confrontational. It's possible that the parent's frustration led to an outburst that wasn't the best approach.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent might have thought that their daughter was being left out, and they were trying to address the exclusion immediately. The mother of the other kids didn't seem to respond, which might have escalated the situation. The daughter did eventually join the play, so maybe the yelling had an effect. But confrontation can sometimes make situations worse. \n\nAnother angle: Did the parent approach the situation calmly first? They didn't mention talking to the other mom first or trying to involve the kids gently. Yelling might have come off as aggressive, making the other mom defensive. Also, public yelling can be intimidating, which might not encourage the kind of inclusion they wanted. \n\nBut then again, the parent's intention was to advocate for their child. Advocacy is important, but the method matters. A more constructive approach, like talking to the mother privately or addressing the kids, might have been better. \n\nSo, considering all that, the parent might be in the wrong because yelling can be seen as inappropriate and could have made the other person defensive. However, their intention was to protect their child's inclusion, which is understandable. But the action taken (yelling) might not be the best approach. So probably answer A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
