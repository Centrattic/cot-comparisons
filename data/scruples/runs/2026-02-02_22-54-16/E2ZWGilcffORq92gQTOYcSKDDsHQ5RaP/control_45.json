Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong after yelling at kids for not including their disabled daughter. The situation is that the daughter was sitting outside watching other kids play, and the parent yelled at the mother of the kids. The daughter then joined the game later when they included her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. Their daughter is disabled and might feel excluded, which can be really hurtful. The parent might feel frustrated and want to protect their child's feelings. The act of yelling could be seen as an immediate reaction to protect their child from exclusion, which is a natural instinct for a parent. However, yelling at another parent in public could escalate the situation and might not be the best approach.\n\nOn the other hand, the other mother might have been unaware of the child's feelings. Maybe the kids didn't realize they were excluding her. The parent yelling could have made the situation awkward and potentially caused the other mother to shut down, as she stormed off. It's possible that a calmer approach, like talking to the other parent privately or encouraging the kids to include everyone, might have been more effective without causing embarrassment.\n\nThe daughter did end up joining the game after the incident, so maybe the yelling had an unintended effect of making the other kids realize and include her. But the method used could have been more constructive. The partner's opinion that they overreacted might be valid because yelling in public isn't the best way to handle such situations. It's important to balance advocacy for one's child with considering how other people are affected.\n\nSo, the parent's intention was to protect their child, which is understandable, but the method of yelling might have been inappropriate. The key here is whether the parent's actions were justified. While the intent is good, the approach could have been better. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the parent being in the wrong for how they handled it, even if the motivation was right. But there's also a strong case for the parent acting in their child's best interest. However, given that yelling can be seen as aggressive and potentially hurtful to the other parent, it's possible that the answer is A (the author is in the wrong). But I should double-check if there's any cultural or contextual factors. The question is in a general context, so probably A is the answer here.\n"
