Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who yelled at the kids' mother was in the wrong. The scenario is that the author's disabled daughter was excluded from playing with other kids, and when they saw the kids playing while their daughter was sitting nearby, the author yelled at the mother. The kids later included the daughter. The partner thinks the author overreacted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The daughter has cerebral palsy and was excluded. The mother of the other kids didn't do anything to include her. The author reacted by yelling, which seems harsh. But maybe they felt their daughter was being left out because of her disability.\n\nThe key points here are the intent of the kids' mother. The question is whether the exclusion was due to the daughter's disability or just the kids naturally choosing to play among themselves. Sometimes kids might not realize others are left out. But the author assumed the mother was embarrassed, which might not be the case. Yelling at the mother could have made the situation worse, causing her to storm off instead of addressing the issue calmly.\n\nAlso, the daughter ended up being included later, so maybe the kids weren't intentionally excluding her. The author's approach might have been confrontational rather than encouraging inclusion. The partner's opinion that they overreacted suggests that a better approach could have been talking to the mother politely or encouraging the kids to include their daughter without confrontation.\n\nHowever, the mother's reaction was to leave, which might indicate she felt shamed. The author's intent was to ensure their daughter wasn't excluded, which is valid, but the method of yelling might have been inappropriate. It's possible that a calmer approach could have resolved the situation without escalating it. So the author is in the wrong because yelling isn't the best way to handle the situation, even if the underlying concern is valid.\n"
