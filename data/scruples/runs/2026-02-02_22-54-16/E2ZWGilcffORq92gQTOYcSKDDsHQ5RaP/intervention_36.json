Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who yelled at the kids' mom was in the wrong. The situation involves a disabled daughter being excluded from play. The parent saw their daughter sitting alone while other kids played nearby. They intervened by yelling at the mother, which led to the mother leaving. The partner thinks they overreacted.\n\nFirst, the key issue is whether it's wrong to confront someone else's kids for excluding a disabled child. The parent's intention was to advocate for their daughter's inclusion, which is understandable and admirable. However, the method used was yelling, which can be seen as aggressive or confrontational. The question is about the appropriateness of the response, not just the underlying intent.\n\nIn social situations, advocating for inclusion is important, but the approach matters. Yelling might escalate tension and could be perceived as accusatory. The other mother's reaction\u2014storming off\u2014suggests she was hurt or defensive. While the parent's concern is valid, a more constructive approach might have been to talk to the kids directly or involve the other parent in a calmer manner. However, the parent's actions were driven by a desire to protect their child's feelings and promote inclusion.\n\nDifferent people might have varying opinions on the best way to handle this scenario. Some may see the parent as justified in standing up for their child, while others might think a less confrontational approach was needed. The answer hinges on whether the means (yelling) were appropriate for the ends (inclusion). Since the parent's actions, though forceful, were motivated by a positive intention, the answer could lean towards not being in the wrong. But there's a valid argument that yelling isn't the best method, so it's a bit of a gray area.\n"
