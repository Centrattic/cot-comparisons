Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author's daughter is disabled, with cerebral palsy. She was sitting outside watching kids play, but the other kids and their mom didn't include her. The author (or their partner) yells at the mother, asking if she's embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. Then the author says something about cerebral palsy not making the daughter poisonous, and the mom storms off. The kids later include the daughter.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the daughter was excluded. Cerebral palsy is a physical disability, so the kids might not be aware of her condition or how to include her. The mother might not have known how to include her daughter in the game. The author's reaction was yelling, which is confrontational. But their intent was to advocate for their daughter's inclusion.\n\nOn one hand, yelling at another parent in public could be seen as aggressive. It might have escalated the situation. The mom might have been unaware that the daughter wanted to play, or maybe she didn't know how to include her. The author's approach could be seen as shaming the mom instead of approaching the situation calmly.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter was excluded, which can be hurtful. The author's concern for their child's social inclusion is valid. Maybe they felt frustrated and acted impulsively. The key point is whether yelling was the right approach. In situations involving children and disabilities, communication styles matter. Yelling might not be effective and could make the other parent defensive.\n\nBut the outcome was positive in the end: the kids included the daughter after the incident. However, the method to get there was confrontational. The partner's opinion is that the author overreacted. It's possible that a calmer approach could have led to inclusion without the confrontation.\n\nSo, the author's intent was good, but the method might not have been appropriate. The question is whether the yelling was in the wrong. The answer depends on balancing the intent with the action. While advocating for inclusion is right, the way it was done might have been wrong. So, the answer could be A (yes, in the wrong) because of the yelling, even if the intent was good. However, some might argue that the parent was justified in standing up for their child. But generally, yelling in such situations is considered inappropriate.\n"
