Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that their daughter is sitting outside, watching other kids play. The author yells at the mother because the kids aren't including their disabled daughter. The daughter has cerebral palsy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions and actions. The author's main concern is their daughter's inclusion. The daughter is trying to engage with the kids but they're not including her. The author feels that the mother is allowing this to happen without intervening. But why did they choose to yell at the mother? Maybe they were frustrated and wanted the kids to include their daughter immediately.\n\nBut yelling might not be the best approach. It could escalate the situation. The mother might not have realized the daughter wanted to join, or maybe the kids didn't know how to include her. Instead of yelling, maybe the author could have approached the mother calmly to discuss it. Yelling could make the mother defensive and less likely to help. The author's partner thinks they overreacted, which suggests that maybe their approach wasn't the best.\n\nAlso, the daughter did end up being included after the incident, so maybe the yelling had the desired effect. But was it necessary? The author's actions were driven by a genuine concern for their child, but their method might have been confrontational. It's a balance between advocating for their child and respecting others' feelings. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intent was good, but the method might be questionable. However, given the emotional context, it's understandable. But in terms of being in the wrong, maybe not, since they were trying to protect their child. But maybe there's a better way. So, the answer could be a bit of both, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the mother didn't respond, the author's yelling might be seen as over the top. So perhaps AITA is more on the side of the author being in the wrong because of the yelling. So answer A (Yes, in the wrong).\n"
