Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at kids for not including their disabled daughter. The situation is that the author saw their daughter sitting alone while other kids played, and when they confronted the mother, they yelled at her. The daughter eventually got included, but the parent is being criticized for overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the parent. They were concerned about their daughter being excluded because of her disability. Parents often feel protective, especially when their child is vulnerable. The daughter has cerebral palsy, which might make social interactions challenging, and seeing her left out could be emotionally distressing for the parent.\n\nOn the other hand, yelling at the mother in public could be seen as confrontational. The parent might not have considered the mother's feelings or the children's intentions. Maybe the kids didn't realize the implications of their actions, and a direct approach might have been better than yelling. The mother was \"gobsmacked,\" which suggests she was taken aback and possibly defensive.\n\nThe parent's approach might have escalated the situation. If they had calmly approached the mother and asked her to encourage the kids to include their daughter, it might have been more effective and less confrontational. However, the parent's intention was to advocate for their child, which is a valid concern.\n\nBut the method used\u2014yelling in public\u2014could be seen as inappropriate, even if the intent was good. It's possible that the parent's frustration led to a reaction that didn't consider the other parent's perspective. The daughter did end up being included eventually, which shows the kids were willing to include her once prompted, so maybe the parent's intervention worked, but the approach was harsh.\n\nSo, balancing the intent to protect their child against the method used, there's a case to be made that the parent overreacted. However, the underlying issue of wanting their child to be included is important. It's a nuanced situation where both the parent's concern and the approach matter. In terms of right or wrong, it's a judgment call. I think the parent wasn't entirely in the wrong, but there's room for a better approach. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal beliefs about how to handle such situations.\n"
