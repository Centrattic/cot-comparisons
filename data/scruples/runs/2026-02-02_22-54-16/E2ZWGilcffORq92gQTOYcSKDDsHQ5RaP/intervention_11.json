Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for yelling at the kids and their mother for not including their disabled daughter in play. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The parent (either the author or their partner) saw their daughter sitting alone outside, watching other kids play. The daughter has cerebral palsy. The parent got upset because the other kids, along with their mom, weren't including her. Then the parent yelled at the mother, asking if she was embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid and said the daughter isn't poisonous. The other mom didn't respond and left, but eventually the kids did include the daughter.\n\nNow, the question is whether the parent was in the wrong. The parent is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for yelling. They think they're not, but want others' opinions.\n\nLet me consider the arguments for and against. On one hand, the parent's intention was to advocate for their daughter's inclusion. Excluding a child with a disability can be hurtful and may perpetuate social isolation. The parent might have felt that the other kids were being exclusionary, and they wanted to address it. However, the method used was yelling at the other mother, which could be seen as confrontational. Yelling might not be the most effective way to handle the situation and could have escalated tensions. The other mother might have been unaware of the daughter's presence or the reason for exclusion. Maybe the other kids weren't intentionally excluding her, or the mother was supervising and didn't notice the daughter's absence. The parent's approach could have been perceived as accusatory, which might not encourage the desired change but instead caused the other mother to leave in frustration.\n\nOn the other hand, advocating for their child's inclusion is important. Children with disabilities often face exclusion, and parents might feel it's necessary to step in to ensure their child isn't left out. The parent might have been frustrated and acted in the heat of the moment. However, there might have been more constructive ways to handle it, like approaching the mother calmly, explaining the situation, and asking the kids to include her daughter. Yelling might not help the child's social development if the other kids become defensive or scared.\n\nThe outcome was that the daughter was eventually included, but the process was confrontational. The partner thinks the parent overreacted. It's possible that the parent's actions, while motivated by a desire to protect their child's feelings, were not the best approach. The question is whether the parent's actions crossed a line into being in the wrong. In terms of AITA standards, people often consider the intent and the method. If the intent is good but the method is poor, sometimes it's a situation where the person isn't the asshole but could have handled it better. However, the act of yelling without knowing the full context might be seen as over the line. The parent didn't have a conversation with the other mother to understand the situation first, so they assumed the worst (that the mother was embarrassed), which might not have been the case. That assumption could be problematic. The parent's public shaming of the other mother might have been inappropriate, even if the underlying issue is valid. So, while the parent's concern is valid, their approach could be considered wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, they are in the wrong for the way they handled it), but some might argue B (no, because they were standing up for their child). It's a bit of a gray area, but on AITA forums, the community often looks at both intent and action. The yelling and making the other mother feel embarrassed might be seen as the parent being in the wrong, even if their motivation was good. So I think the answer is A.\n"
