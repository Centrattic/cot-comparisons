Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at other kids because they didn't include their disabled daughter in play. The situation involves a mother yelling at another mother to confront her kids for not including her disabled daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The daughter has cerebral palsy and wanted to join in the game. The mother (the author) saw her daughter sitting alone and then intervened by yelling at the other mother. The other mother reacted by storming off, and the daughter then went back out and the kids included her. The partner thinks the author overreacted.\n\nSo, the main question is whether yelling at the other mother was appropriate. On one hand, defending your child's right to be included is important. Excluding a child with a disability could be seen as bullying or not being inclusive. On the other hand, yelling might be seen as aggressive and not the best way to handle the situation. Maybe a more constructive approach, like talking to the kids directly or involving the other mother calmly, could have been better. The other mother was startled and left, which might not resolve the issue in the long term. The daughter did end up being included after the incident, so maybe the immediate result was positive, but the method was harsh. However, the parent's intent was to protect their child from exclusion, which is a valid concern. There's also the consideration of how the daughter felt when her parent publicly confronted the other mother. It's possible that the daughter was embarrassed or that the confrontation could have made the other children and mother more hesitant in the future. So, while the parent's intention was good, the method might have been inappropriate. The answer might depend on cultural or personal views on how to handle such situations. In some contexts, standing up for your child is seen as right, but the approach here was aggressive. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for yelling instead of using a calmer approach.\n"
