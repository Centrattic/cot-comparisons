Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom was in the wrong. The situation is about their disabled daughter not being included in the play.\n\nFirst, the daughter was sitting on the veranda watching the kids play, but not participating. The parent got upset and yelled at the mother, making a comment about being embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. Then followed up with a comment about cerebral palsy. The kids eventually included the daughter later.\n\nHmm. The parent's intention was to defend their daughter's right to be included, which is understandable. But yelling and making an accusation like \"embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid\" could come off as confrontational. It might have made the other mother defensive, leading her to storm off. The parent's partner thinks they overreacted, which adds another layer.\n\nOn one hand, advocating for inclusion is important. On the other hand, the approach was confrontational. Maybe a better way would be to talk to the mother calmly instead of yelling. But the parent's frustration is valid given the situation. However, the method used could be seen as aggressive, even if the intent was good. So, is the parent in the wrong? It's a tough call. The answer might depend on cultural or personal views on directness versus diplomatic approaches.\n"
