Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom for not including their disabled daughter was in the wrong. The situation is that the daughter was sitting on the veranda watching the kids play, and the parent yelled at the other mother, implying she was embarrassed to be seen with a disabled child. The daughter then moved closer, and the other mom left, but eventually the kids included her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The parent's main concern is that their daughter wasn't included. The daughter has cerebral palsy, which might make social inclusion challenging. The parent intervened by yelling, which is a strong reaction. The other mother didn't respond, but the kids eventually included the daughter.\n\nNow, considering if the parent was in the wrong. Yelling could be seen as aggressive. But the parent's intention was to advocate for their child's inclusion. However, the method might be questionable. Was the daughter's exclusion intentional? The story says the mother was watching the kids, so maybe she didn't realize the daughter was there. The parent's approach might have been confrontational without understanding the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, advocating for a child's inclusion is important, especially for a disabled child who might face exclusion more often. The parent might feel that their daughter's rights to play and socialize are being overlooked. But yelling, especially in public, could be seen as overreacting and might have escalated the situation. The other mother might feel embarrassed or defensive, leading her to leave. \n\nThe partner's opinion that it was an overreaction adds another layer. The parent might not have considered a calmer approach, like approaching the mother politely to ask if the daughter could join. Yelling could be perceived as aggressive rather than a request for inclusion. \n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? It's a balance between advocating for their child and the method used. The intention was good, but the approach might be inappropriate. The answer might be A, but it's not clear-cut. However, since the daughter did get included later, maybe the yelling had some effect, but the method remains questionable. I think the parent is not in the wrong because the intent was to protect their child's inclusion, but some might argue the method was wrong. The answer might be B, but there's nuance.\n"
