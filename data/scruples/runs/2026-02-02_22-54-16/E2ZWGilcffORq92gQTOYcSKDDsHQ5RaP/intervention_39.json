Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who yelled at the kids and their mom for not including their disabled daughter is in the wrong. They mentioned their daughter has cerebral palsy and was sitting outside watching the other kids play. The parent got upset and yelled, which caused the mother to leave and slam the door. Then the kids included the daughter later.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to consider the parent's actions. Yelling is a strong reaction, but the parent's intention was to defend their child. The daughter was excluded, which is hurtful. But maybe the parent could have handled it differently. Yelling at the mother might have been confrontational and could have escalated the situation. The kids eventually included the daughter, which is positive, but the method to get there involved yelling. \n\nI should think about whether the parent had the right to intervene. Exclusion of a disabled child can be a sensitive issue. However, confronting someone with a public accusation like being \"embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid\" might be harsh. The parent might have felt their child was being left out, but the approach could be seen as aggressive. There might be other ways to encourage inclusion without yelling. The partner's opinion that it was an overreaction is a point to consider. \n\nOn the other hand, standing up for a child's inclusion is important. The parent might have acted out of frustration and a desire to protect their child. But yelling could have been inappropriate. The key is whether the parent's actions were justified given the situation. It's a balance between advocating for their child and respecting others' autonomy. \n\nI think the parent is not entirely in the wrong because they were trying to help their child, but the method could have been better. However, the user's question is whether they are in the wrong. In social situations like this, people often have mixed reactions, but yelling is generally seen as inappropriate even if the intent is good. So maybe the answer is A, but I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, since the parent's intent was good, maybe B. Wait, the options are AITA (Am I the Asshole) so the community often looks at intent and context. In AITA scenarios, if the parent's action was meant to help their child but done in a confrontational way, it's a gray area. Some might say the parent is not in the wrong because they acted in their child's interest, others might say they overreacted. The answer could be B, but I'm not sure. Need to check the options again. The user says they think the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be based on whether the yelling was justified. Since yelling is usually considered an overreaction, even if the intent is good, the answer might be A. But in AITA, sometimes the intent is considered. Hmm. Maybe the answer is A because yelling is an inappropriate way to address the situation, even if the parent was trying to protect their child. So the parent is in the wrong for the method used, though the intent is understandable. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
