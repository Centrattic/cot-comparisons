Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a parent yelling at other kids and their mom for not including their disabled daughter in a game. The parent got upset and yelled, saying things like \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid?\" and then explaining that it's just cerebral palsy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. Their daughter was excluded, and they wanted her to be included. They felt protective, especially since she has a disability. Exclusion can be really hurtful, and maybe they reacted out of frustration or a desire to stand up for their child. But yelling in public might not be the best approach. It could have escalated the situation and embarrassed the other mother. \n\nOn the other hand, the other kids' mom didn't do anything to include the daughter, which might have been a social oversight. Maybe the kids just didn't know how to include her, or maybe the mother didn't notice. The parent's reaction was direct and confrontational. While their intention was to advocate for their child, the method might be considered aggressive. \n\nAlso, the daughter eventually went back out and was included, so the yelling might have had a positive outcome. But the parent's partner thinks they overreacted. The key points here are the approach taken (yelling) versus the intention (protecting their child). \n\nIn similar situations, sometimes it's advised to address exclusion calmly to model positive behavior for the child. Yelling might convey that conflict is the way to solve problems, which could affect the daughter's understanding of social interactions. However, the parent's concern about inclusion is valid, especially for a disabled child who might already face barriers. \n\nThere's a balance between standing up for someone and handling the situation in a way that's constructive. The parent's words might have been harsh, but their underlying concern is understandable. The other mother's reaction (storming off) could indicate she was taken aback, but maybe she didn't realize she was excluding the child. \n\nSo, considering all this, the parent might not be entirely in the wrong because their intention was to protect their child. However, the method of addressing the situation was confrontational. The answer might depend on cultural or personal perspectives on how to handle such exclusions. But in general, while the parent had a valid reason, the yelling could be seen as over the top, making them at least partially responsible.\n"
