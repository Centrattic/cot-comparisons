Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author saw their disabled daughter (with cerebral palsy) sitting on a chair watching two kids playing ball in the cul-de-sac. They went out and yelled at the kids' mother, asking if she was embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. Then the author added that cerebral palsy isn't contagious or anything, and the mother stormed off. The daughter eventually got included by the kids.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault (AITA) for yelling in this situation. The partner thinks they overreacted.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The daughter is disabled and was being excluded. The author's reaction was to confront the mother. Yelling in public is a strong action. Now, the question is whether it's justified.\n\nOn one hand, excluding someone based on their disability is wrong, and advocating for inclusion is good. But the method here was yelling at the mother, which might have been confrontational and public. It could have made the mother defensive instead of addressing the issue constructively. The daughter did end up included, though, so maybe the yelling had an effect, but what about the approach?\n\nIs there a better way to handle it without yelling? Maybe approaching the mother privately to explain the situation. Yelling might have been perceived as aggressive, even if the intent was to defend their child. The mother's reaction was to storm off, which might suggest that the approach was not effective and possibly hurtful.\n\nAlso, the author's partner thinks they overreacted. That's a point to consider. Sometimes, even if the intent is good, the method can be inappropriate. The daughter might also feel embarrassed by the public confrontation.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author's motivation was to ensure their child was included. It's a natural instinct to protect a child from exclusion, especially when there's a disability involved. The mother might have been unaware of the exclusion or didn't realize the impact of it.\n\nI need to weigh the intent versus the method. The intent was good, but the method (yelling in public) might not have been the best approach. Public shaming or confrontation can backfire, even if the intention is to do good. It could have created a hostile situation rather than fostering inclusion.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong in terms of how they handled it, even if their concern was valid. The partner's perspective is that they overreacted, which suggests that the approach was more about venting frustration than solving the problem. The alternative could have been to talk to the mother calmly, explain the situation, and encourage inclusion without public confrontation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's concern was justified, the method of addressing it by yelling might have been inappropriate. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because the approach was not constructive and could have been handled better.\n"
