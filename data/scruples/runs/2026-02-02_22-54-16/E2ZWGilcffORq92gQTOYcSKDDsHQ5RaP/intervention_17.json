Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who yelled at the kids' mom was in the wrong. The situation involves their disabled daughter being excluded from play.\n\nFirst, the parent saw their daughter sitting alone while other kids played. They confront the other mom, yelling about being embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. Then they make a comment about cerebral palsy not making the kid poisonous. The other mom reacts by leaving, but the kids eventually include the daughter.\n\nNow, considering the parent's motivation: they wanted their child included. That's understandable. However, the method was yelling, which can be seen as aggressive. The parent might have felt frustration and acted on emotion. But was it justified?\n\nThere's a balance between advocating for inclusion and maintaining respectful communication. Yelling might have escalated the situation. The other mom didn't initially respond, so maybe she was taken aback. The daughter did end up joining the kids later, but the parent's approach might have caused more tension than necessary.\n\nAlso, the partner thinks the parent overreacted. That's a red flag. Maybe there's a perspective that a more calm approach could have been more effective. The parent's message was valid, but the delivery might have been counterproductive. \n\nIn terms of social norms, yelling in public can be seen as inconsiderate. Even if the intent is good, the method matters. The parent might not be in the wrong for wanting inclusion, but the way they handled it could be seen as wrong. So, it's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards AITA because of the yelling and the public confrontation style.\n"
