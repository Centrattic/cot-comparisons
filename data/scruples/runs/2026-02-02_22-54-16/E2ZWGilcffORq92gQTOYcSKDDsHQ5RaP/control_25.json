Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's daughter is disabled, specifically with cerebral palsy. The daughter was sitting outside, watching other kids playing ball. The author saw this and then yelled at the mother of the kids, asking if she was embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. Then the author added, \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything.\" The other mom left, and the kids eventually included the daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the motivations. The author was trying to advocate for their daughter's inclusion. It's understandable that a parent would want their child to be included, especially if the child is disabled and might face exclusion. But the method used was yelling, which can be confrontational. The question is whether that reaction was appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, the author had a valid concern. Children can be unintentionally exclusive, and maybe the other kids didn't realize they should include the author's daughter. The parent might have felt frustrated and used a direct approach to address what they saw as intentional exclusion. But on the other hand, yelling can escalate tensions and might not encourage the other parent to foster inclusion. The comment about being embarrassed could be hurtful, even if unintended. The other mother might have felt attacked, leading her to leave, but the kids ended up including the daughter afterward. \n\nThe partner thinks the author overreacted. Is yelling the right way to handle a situation where you want to promote inclusion? Maybe a more diplomatic approach, like talking to the mother calmly or encouraging the children, could have worked better. However, the author's intent was to protect their daughter's feelings and ensure inclusion, which is a good intention. \n\nAlso, the daughter did end up being included after the incident, which is positive. But the method of confrontation might not be the best way to model behavior for the daughter or to build relationships with other parents. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's intentions were good, but the approach might have been too aggressive. However, the line between standing up for one's child and overreacting can be thin. In some contexts, advocating for inclusion is right, but the method matters. The key factors are intent, method, and outcome. The author wanted inclusion, used aggressive methods, but the outcome was positive. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for the method used. Some might say yes because yelling can be seen as aggressive, but others might argue it's justified in the context of defending their child. It's a bit tricky. I think there's a balance here. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because the intent was good, but the approach could have been better. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong, so maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong, but some might argue A. Given the situation, I think B is more appropriate because the underlying reason is valid, even if the approach could have been improved.\n"
