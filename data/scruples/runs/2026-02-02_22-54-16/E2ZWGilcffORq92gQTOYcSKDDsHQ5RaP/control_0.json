Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author's partner) is at fault for yelling at some kids' parents for not including their disabled daughter in play.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's daughter is sitting outside, watching other kids play. The author (or their partner) yells at the mother, questioning if she's embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. Then adds that it's just cerebral palsy and not dangerous. The mother storms off, and eventually, the daughter gets included.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author's intent was to advocate for their daughter, which is understandable. However, yelling and making confrontational remarks might have been the wrong approach. The author could have approached the mother calmly, asked why the kids weren't including their daughter, and explained the situation in a more constructive way. Yelling could be seen as aggressive and might have alienated the other mother instead of encouraging her to include the child.\n\nAlso, the partner's reaction suggests that there's a valid concern about overreacting. The daughter eventually got included, so maybe a calmer approach would have led to the same result without the conflict. The key issue here is the method used. Advocating for inclusion is right, but the manner in which it was done might be problematic. So, while the intent is good, the action taken could be considered inappropriate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the way they handled the situation.\n"
