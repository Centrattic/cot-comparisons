Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom is in the wrong. The situation is about a disabled daughter being excluded from play. The user's partner (or the person in question) yelled at the mother, saying things like \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid?\" and then \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous.\" The daughter eventually was included, but the parent is upset about the reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The person intervened because they felt their daughter was excluded. The mother of the kids didn't seem to be actively excluding, but maybe the kids were just not inviting. However, the method of intervention was yelling, which is aggressive. Yelling can escalate situations and might have been public shaming, which isn't helpful.\n\nAlso, the mother's reaction was to storm off, indicating she felt attacked. Even if the intent was good, the approach might have been inappropriate. The partner agrees that the person overreacted, which adds a perspective that maybe they should have handled it differently, perhaps by talking to the mother privately instead of yelling in front of others. \n\nBut the other side is that the parent's daughter was being excluded, which is hurtful. The parent's frustration is understandable, especially if they've faced similar issues before. However, public confrontation might not be the best way to address it. The daughter did end up being included, so maybe the yelling had the desired effect, but the method is questionable.\n\nIn terms of social norms, yelling at someone, even if you're upset, is often seen as poor handling. It's possible that the parent could have approached the situation more calmly and privately. So the parent might be in the wrong for their reaction, even if their intent was to protect their child's inclusion.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of defending their child's right to participate. If the other kids were excluding the daughter because of her disability, that's a problem, and the parent might feel compelled to act. However, the way they acted could have been more constructive.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: the parent's intent was to address exclusion, but the method (yelling publicly) was inappropriate. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for how they handled it, even if the situation was frustrating. Answer A.\n"
