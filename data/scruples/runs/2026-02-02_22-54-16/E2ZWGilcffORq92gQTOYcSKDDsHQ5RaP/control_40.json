Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author (on behalf of their partner) yelled at another mother for not including their disabled daughter in play. The daughter has cerebral palsy and was sitting separately. The author confronted the mother, asking if she's embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid, and then made another comment about it not being a big deal. The mother left, but the kids later included the daughter.\n\nFirst, the key issue is whether yelling was an appropriate response. The author's intention was to advocate for their daughter, which is understandable. However, yelling and making accusatory comments like \"embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid\" might be seen as confrontational. Even if the mother was excluding the child, the approach here was aggressive. The mother might have had her own reasons, maybe not realizing the child wanted to play, or maybe she thought it was safer. The author's public confrontation could have made the other parent defensive, leading to her storming off. The daughter did end up joining the game eventually, so maybe the author's actions inadvertently led to the positive outcome, but the method was harsh. The partner's reaction that they overreacted also suggests that maybe there's a different way to handle it. So the question is, was the yelling and aggressive approach wrong? Probably yes, even if the intention was good. So the answer would be A.\n"
