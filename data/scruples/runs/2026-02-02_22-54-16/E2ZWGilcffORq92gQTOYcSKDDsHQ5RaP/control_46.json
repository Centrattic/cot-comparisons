Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent yelling at another child's mom because their disabled daughter wasn't included in play. The daughter has cerebral palsy.\n\nFirst, the parent saw their daughter sitting on the veranda watching other kids play. They went out to confront the mother, yelling and asking if she was embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. Then they said the kid isn't poisonous, implying it's not a big deal, and the other mom left. The daughter then went back out and the kids included her.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about inclusion and the method used to address it. The parent's intention was to advocate for their child's inclusion, which is valid. But yelling at the other parent might not be the best approach. It's understandable that they wanted their daughter to be included, especially since the daughter was watching the others play. However, publicly confronting the mother in a loud and accusatory manner could have been hurtful and might not have been effective in the long run. The other mother left, so maybe the interaction didn't help the daughter join the game. The parent's partner thinks they overreacted, which adds another perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, advocating for inclusion is important. The parent might have felt frustrated and acted out of emotion. But yelling can escalate situations and might not model the behavior they want their child to see. The daughter did eventually join the game, so maybe the situation improved, but the parent's approach could have been handled better. So, maybe the parent is not entirely wrong, but their method was questionable. The question is whether they are in the wrong. The answer might be a mix, but according to the options given (A or B), if the question is whether they are in the wrong, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because their intent was to protect their child's inclusion, but some might say A because of the yelling. It's a bit of a grey area. But in similar AITA scenarios, people often say the parent is justified in defending their child even if the approach was rough. So maybe B is the answer here.\n"
