Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who yelled at the kids' mother is in the wrong. The situation involves a disabled daughter being excluded from play, and the parent got upset and yelled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has cerebral palsy, which is a physical disability. She was sitting on the veranda watching other kids play. The parent felt that the kids (and their mother) weren't including her, leading to the outburst. The parent's main concern is their child's inclusion and social interaction, which is valid. \n\nBut then there's the method used\u2014yelling at the mother and making a comment about being embarrassed. Yelling can be seen as aggressive, even if the intention was to advocate for their child. The mother might have felt accused without understanding the full context. The parent's actions could have been perceived as confrontational, which might not be the best approach in a public setting. \n\nHowever, the parent's intent was to address the exclusion. The daughter was eventually included, so the outcome was positive. The partner thinks it was overreacting, but the parent was acting out of concern for their child's inclusion. \n\nI should consider social norms and whether yelling is an appropriate response. While the parent's intention is noble, the method could be questioned. Maybe there's a better way to handle it without confrontation. But the parent was trying to stand up for their child, which is understandable. \n\nBalancing these factors: maybe the parent is not entirely in the wrong because they were advocating for their child, but the approach might have been inappropriate. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. In many cases, direct confrontation in public can be seen as wrong, even if the motivation is good. So maybe answer A, but I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, if the inclusion of the child is more important than the method, maybe B. But the yelling could have been hurtful. Hmm.\n"
