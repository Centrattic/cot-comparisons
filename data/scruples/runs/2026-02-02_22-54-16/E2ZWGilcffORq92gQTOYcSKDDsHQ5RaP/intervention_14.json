Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who yelled at the kids' mom for not including their disabled daughter is in the wrong. The situation is that their daughter wanted to join the kids playing, but the other kids' mom didn't let them play together. The person yelled at the mom, called her out for maybe being embarrassed, and made a comment about cerebral palsy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has a disability, and the parent is advocating for her inclusion. That's a valid concern. Parents often want their children to feel included and accepted. However, the method used here was yelling publicly and making a confrontational comment. That could be seen as aggressive, even if the intent was good. \n\nThe key points here are the intent versus the method. The parent's intention was to protect their daughter's feelings and encourage inclusion, which is understandable. But yelling in a public place might have escalated the situation. The mother of the other kids was taken aback, and the situation ended with her storming off. \n\nAlso, the parent's partner thinks they overreacted. It's important to consider social norms here. While advocating for inclusion is right, the approach taken might not be the most effective. Public shaming, even if unintended, can be hurtful and might not lead to positive change. The other children eventually included the daughter, which is a good outcome, but the method could have been different. \n\nAnother angle is the mother's reaction. If she didn't want her kids to play with the disabled child, maybe there were other reasons beyond just embarrassment. The parent might not have considered that. However, the assumption here is that the mother's behavior was excluding the child, which could be due to prejudice. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parent might not be \"in the wrong\" in terms of their intention, but the method of confrontation could be seen as inappropriate. So, the answer might depend on whether the action was justified given the circumstances. \n\nBut the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider if yelling was the only option. Maybe there's a middle ground, like talking to the mother privately. However, in the heat of the moment, emotions can take over. The parent might have felt their child was being excluded and acted impulsively. \n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intent was to help their daughter, the method used could have been more diplomatic. But the core issue of wanting inclusion isn't wrong. So, the answer might be that the parent isn't in the wrong, but they could have handled it better.\n"
