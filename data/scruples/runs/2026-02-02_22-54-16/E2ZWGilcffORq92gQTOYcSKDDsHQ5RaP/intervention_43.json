Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at the kids' mother because they didn't include their disabled daughter in their play. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The writer's daughter is sitting outside watching other kids playing, and the writer yells at the mother, implying she's embarrassed to be seen with a disabled child. Then the mother leaves, and later the kids include the daughter. The partner thinks the writer overreacted.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The writer's intent was to advocate for their daughter's inclusion. But yelling at someone, even if the cause is good, can be seen as aggressive. The mother was a stranger, so confronting her in public like that might be seen as inappropriate. \n\nBut then again, the daughter was excluded, and the writer felt the need to act because the daughter's feelings might be hurt. However, the method of confrontation was yelling, which can escalate situations. Maybe a better approach would be to talk calmly or address the kids directly. \n\nThe key points here are intent versus action. The intent was protective and to promote inclusion, which is admirable. But the action was aggressive, which might not be the best way to handle the situation. The mother's reaction was to leave, and the kids eventually included the daughter, which is positive. \n\nSo, is the writer in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, advocating for inclusion is right. On the other hand, yelling at a stranger can be seen as inconsiderate. Maybe there's a middle ground. The answer might depend on cultural norms or personal opinions. But given that the writer was trying to protect their child's feelings and encourage inclusion, some might side with them. However, others might say there are better ways to handle it without yelling. \n\nI think the answer here is B (No), because the motivation was to include their child, which is a valid concern. But it's a nuanced situation where the approach could be questioned. The writer might not be in the wrong because the intent was good, even if the method was a bit harsh.\n"
