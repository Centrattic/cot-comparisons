Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story did something wrong by yelling at other kids for not including their disabled daughter. The situation involves a mother (or partner) getting upset when their daughter is excluded from play by other children.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has cerebral palsy, which is a physical disability. The other kids are playing ball in the cul-de-sac, and the daughter is sitting nearby watching. The author (assuming it's the parent) yells at the other mother, asking if she's embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. Then later adds that the daughter isn't poisonous, implying that it's not a problem to include her.\n\nThe key points here are the method of addressing the situation and the appropriateness of the reaction. Yelling at another parent in public, even if motivated by a desire to protect or include their child, might be seen as confrontational and possibly inconsiderate. Public yelling can escalate tensions and might not be the most effective way to encourage inclusion. The other mother's reaction\u2014storming off into the caravan\u2014suggests that the approach was off-putting.\n\nHowever, the parent's intention is to advocate for their child's inclusion. The daughter was excluded, which could be hurtful. The parent's frustration is understandable. But the question is whether the method used was appropriate. Yelling might not model inclusive behavior and could make the other parent defensive instead of receptive to the idea of including the child.\n\nAlso, the daughter eventually joined the play after the incident. Maybe the parent's outburst did lead to inclusion, but that doesn't necessarily justify the method. It's possible that a calmer approach, like approaching the other parent privately or encouraging their child in a kinder way, could have been more effective and respectful.\n\nThe partner thinks the parent overreacted, which adds another perspective. Public shaming or confrontation can sometimes backfire. The parent's actions might have caused more harm by creating an awkward or hostile situation, which could make the other family less likely to include the daughter in the future.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, advocating for one's child is a parent's right, but the approach matters. The parent's frustration is valid, but the method of expressing it could be questioned. There's a balance between standing up for one's child and maintaining respectful interactions with others.\n\nSo, while the parent's concern is understandable, the way they handled it might be seen as wrong because it involved public confrontation and yelling, which could be considered inappropriate. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
