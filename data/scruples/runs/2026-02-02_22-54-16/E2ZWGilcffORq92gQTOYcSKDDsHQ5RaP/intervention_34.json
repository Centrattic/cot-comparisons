Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent yelling at another child's mom because their disabled daughter wasn't included in play. The author's partner (or the author themselves) saw their daughter sitting alone and then yelled at the mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The parent's main concern is their daughter being excluded because she's disabled. They felt the other kids didn't include her, which might be due to disability. The parent's reaction was yelling, which can be seen as confrontational. But the motive is to advocate for their child.\n\nBut then, yelling isn't the best way to handle it. Maybe the parent should have approached the mother calmly, discussed the situation, and tried to encourage inclusion without confrontation. However, the parent might have felt frustrated and acted on impulse.\n\nThe other mother's reaction was to storm off, which doesn't clarify her intent. Maybe she was embarrassed or didn't realize the exclusion was due to disability. But the parent assumed the worst\u2014being \"embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid,\" which is a strong accusation.\n\nThe daughter eventually joined the kids, so maybe the parent's outburst had an effect. But the method was confrontational. The partner thinks they overreacted. So, is the parent in the wrong for using yelling? It's a judgment call. While the intent is good, the method could be better. However, the parent's goal was to protect their child's right to play. \n\nIn some perspectives, advocating for inclusion is right, but the approach matters. Yelling might not be the best approach. However, others might argue that given the situation, the parent acted in their child's best interest. So, depending on the perspective, the answer could vary between A and B. But in many cases, the method of confrontation without understanding the other side's perspective could be seen as wrong. So maybe A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because yelling without considering the other mother's perspective and using a harsh tone might be inappropriate, even with good intentions.\n"
