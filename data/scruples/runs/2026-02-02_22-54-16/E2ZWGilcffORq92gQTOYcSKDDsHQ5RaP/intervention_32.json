Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story did something wrong by yelling at other kids' mother for not including their disabled daughter. The situation is that the mother saw her daughter being left out while other kids were playing. She yelled at the other mother, who then left. The daughter later joined the kids and was included. The partner thinks the mother overreacted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has cerebral palsy, which might affect how she's treated by others. The mother was watching from the end of the driveway, not participating. The other mother didn't intervene or include the child. The author's intention was to protect their daughter and encourage inclusion. But yelling might not be the best approach.\n\nOn one hand, advocating for inclusion is important, especially for a child who might feel excluded. Standing up for her rights and ensuring she's not discriminated against is valid. Cerebral palsy is a physical disability, and the other children might not have realized the importance of inclusion. The mother's anger comes from a place of wanting her child to be accepted.\n\nOn the other hand, yelling at the other mother could be seen as confrontational and might not have been the most effective way to handle the situation. It could have escalated tensions and made the other mother defensive, leading her to leave. The partner's reaction suggests that he felt it was an overreaction. Publicly shaming someone, even with good intentions, might not encourage the desired behavior and could create embarrassment.\n\nThe daughter did eventually get included, so maybe the direct approach worked in that case. But the method used was aggressive. There might be a better way to address the issue without confrontation, such as talking to the other mother in a calmer setting or explaining the situation to the children involved. The key here is whether the ends justify the means. The intention was good, but the approach was harsh.\n\nAlso, cultural and personal perspectives matter. Some might believe that standing up for one's child is necessary, while others might prioritize maintaining good relations with neighbors. The fact that the other mother didn't respond and left might indicate that the approach was too harsh for her to handle, possibly leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while advocating for inclusion is crucial, how it's done is equally important. The line between standing up for someone and aggressive behavior can be thin. The question is whether yelling was the right method here. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to protect their child, but the method could be questioned. So the answer might be a nuanced 'no' because the intent was right, but the approach could be seen as wrong. However, given the context of a disabled child being excluded, some might side with the author's actions as justified.\n"
