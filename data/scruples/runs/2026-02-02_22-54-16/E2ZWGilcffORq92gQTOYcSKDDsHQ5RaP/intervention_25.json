Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who yelled at the kids' mother was in the wrong. The situation involves their disabled daughter being excluded from a game.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the exclusion of the child. The parent noticed this and felt compelled to act. The daughter has cerebral palsy, which is mentioned as not being contagious. The parent's reaction was yelling, which could be seen as aggressive. \n\nOn one hand, advocating for inclusion is important, especially for a child with special needs. The parent might have felt their daughter was being left out because of her disability, which is a valid concern. The mother of the other kids didn't respond, which might have escalated the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, yelling at another parent might not be the best approach. It could be perceived as confrontational and might not have helped the situation. The partner thinks it was an overreaction, which suggests that using a calmer approach might have been more effective. However, the parent's intent was to ensure inclusion, which is a positive motive.\n\nThe resolution was that the kids eventually included the daughter, so maybe the yelling had an effect. But it's possible that a more diplomatic approach could have achieved the same result without conflict. \n\nConsidering all this, while the parent's intention was good, the method of addressing the issue was aggressive. Whether that makes them \"in the wrong\" depends on the context of their actions and the potential harm caused. There's a balance between standing up for one's child and handling the situation respectfully.\n"
