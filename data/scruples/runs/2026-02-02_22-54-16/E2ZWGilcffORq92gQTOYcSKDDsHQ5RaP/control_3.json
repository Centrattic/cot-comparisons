Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mother for not including their disabled daughter is in the wrong. The scenario is that their daughter was sitting outside watching other kids play, but the other kids didn't include her. The parent then yells at the mother, and later the kids did include their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has cerebral palsy, so she might have physical or social challenges. The parent's reaction was to confront the other mother, which led to the other mother leaving. The partner thinks they overreacted. \n\nIn these kinds of situations, it's important to balance standing up for one's child and respecting others. The parent wants to advocate for their child's inclusion, which is a valid concern. However, yelling at another adult might not be the best approach. It's possible that the other mother didn't realize her children weren't including the daughter, or she might have been unaware of the situation. Yelling could have made her defensive or embarrassed, leading to the storming off.\n\nThe parent's intention was to ensure inclusion, but the method used was confrontational. There might be alternative ways to address the situation, like approaching the mother calmly to talk about including their daughter. However, the outcome was that the kids did include the daughter, so maybe the parent's action had a positive effect, but the method was harsh.\n\nI need to think about social norms. Public shaming or yelling can be seen as aggressive, even if the intent is good. The other mother might not have known the daughter's condition was an issue, so the parent's approach could have been more constructive. But on the other hand, advocating for one's child is important, especially when there's a disability involved.\n\nThe key here is whether the parent's response was proportionate. Yelling in public could be seen as overreacting, but if the parent felt their child was being excluded due to her disability, they might feel justified. It's a tricky balance. The answer might depend on cultural norms and how confrontational is acceptable in such situations.\n\nSo, the parent isn't in the wrong for wanting to include their child, but the method (yelling) might be considered inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because yelling is an inappropriate reaction, even if the intent was good. However, if the community or cultural context is more tolerant of direct approaches, maybe not. But generally, yelling is seen as aggressive and not the best approach. So the answer is A.\n"
