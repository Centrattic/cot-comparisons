Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who yelled at the kids' mom for excluding their disabled daughter is in the wrong (AITA). The key points here are the situation, the actions taken, and the possible motivations.\n\nFirst, the scenario: the author's daughter has cerebral palsy and was sitting nearby while other kids played. The mom didn't include the daughter, leading the author to yell at the mother. The daughter eventually got included, but the mom left upset.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but others might disagree. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, advocating for inclusion is important, especially for a child who might feel left out. The author's reaction could be seen as standing up for their daughter's right to be part of the group. However, yelling might be seen as an overreaction. Public confrontations can be embarrassing and might not be the most effective way to encourage inclusion. The mother might have had a different reason for not including the child, like not knowing how to include her or being unaware of the situation.\n\nAlso, the partner thought the author overreacted. That's a red flag because the situation could have been handled differently. Maybe approaching the mother calmly after the fact would have been better. The author's approach might have made the mother defensive, leading her to leave, which could have been avoided.\n\nAnother angle: public shaming isn't usually effective. While the intent was good, the method was aggressive. The daughter did end up being included later, so maybe the yelling wasn't necessary. The author might have wanted to teach the other kids a lesson, but yelling might not be the right approach for kids. The mother's reaction (storming off) suggests it was hurtful, even if unintended.\n\nIn terms of AITA, it's a grey area. The author's intent was to protect their daughter, but the method was confrontational. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal feelings about how to handle such situations. However, the consensus in many AITA threads is that while the intent is understandable, the approach was problematic. So, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the yelling, even if the motivation was good.\n"
