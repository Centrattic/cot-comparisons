Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for yelling at kids and their mom because their disabled daughter wasn't included in the play. The daughter has cerebral palsy.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The parent saw their daughter excluded from the kids playing. The parent then yells at the mother, accused her of being embarrassed, and made a comment about the daughter not being \"poisonous.\" The kids eventually included the daughter after the parent's outburst.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the parent's intention was to include their disabled child, but they chose to yell and confront the other mother in a public setting. The question is whether that reaction is justified or if the parent overreacted.\n\nOn one hand, advocating for inclusion is important, especially for a child with disabilities who might face social challenges. The parent might have felt frustrated or anxious about their child being excluded, and their outburst was a way to address that immediately. However, yelling in a public place and making accusatory comments could be seen as aggressive and potentially shaming the other parent, which might not be the best approach. It could also have made the other kids and the mother uncomfortable, possibly leading to the opposite effect if the mother felt attacked instead of understanding the need for inclusion.\n\nAnother angle is the perspective of the partner, who thinks the parent overreacted. The parent's actions might have caused embarrassment for everyone involved, including the daughter. While the outcome was positive (the kids included the daughter later), the method used could have been more constructive. Approaching the mother calmly, speaking privately, or addressing the issue with the kids might have been more effective and respectful.\n\nAlso, the parent's statement about being \"embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid\" is a strong accusation. It's possible the mother didn't realize the daughter was there or didn't intend to exclude her. The parent's assumption that the mother was embarrassed could be incorrect, and confronting her with that assumption might not have been fair.\n\nIn terms of social norms and parenting approaches, aggression is often discouraged. The parent's goal was good (promoting inclusion), but the method used might not have been the best. It's possible the parent could have handled the situation differently, perhaps by talking to the mother privately or encouraging the kids to include the daughter in a less confrontational way.\n\nHowever, the parent was trying to advocate for their child's inclusion, which is a valid concern. Disabled children often face challenges in social settings, and the parent's frustration is understandable. The line between advocacy and confrontation is thin here.\n\nConsidering all this, the parent's intent was to protect and include their child, but the method of yelling and public confrontation could be seen as overreacting. The partner's view that they overreacted might be valid. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because the approach was overly aggressive and could have been handled more sensitively, even if the intent was good.\n"
