Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom is in the wrong. The situation involves their daughter with cerebral palsy not being included in a game. The parent yells at the mother of the other kids, asking if she's embarrassed to be seen with a disabled child. The mom storms off, but later the kids include their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions. The parent's main concern is their daughter's inclusion and feeling excluded. They were frustrated and angry, which led to yelling. But yelling at another parent can be seen as aggressive. The key point is whether the reaction was justified given the situation.\n\nOn one hand, advocating for their child's inclusion is important. The parent might feel that the other kids and their mom ignored their daughter intentionally. On the other hand, yelling in public and making a comment about the other mom's embarrassment could come off as confrontational and judgmental. The other mom might have had different reasons for not including the kids\u2014maybe the kids weren't interested, or there was a communication issue.\n\nThe daughter eventually got included, which is positive. The partner thinks the parent overreacted, which is a red flag. Public confrontation might escalate tensions and damage community relations. Also, the parent's approach could have been more constructive, like approaching the mom calmly to discuss inclusion.\n\nSo, while the parent's intention was to protect their child, the method was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong). They should have handled it with more diplomacy rather than yelling.\n"
