Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent yelling at another child's mother because their disabled daughter wasn't included in play. The parent is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The daughter has cerebral palsy, so she's disabled. She was sitting outside watching the kids play, and the parent got upset because the kids weren't including her. They yelled at the mother, asking if she was embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid, and then added that it's just cerebral palsy, she's not poisonous. The mother left, and later the kids did include the daughter.\n\nThe author thinks they're not in the wrong. The partner says they overreacted. Now, the question is whether the parent was wrong to yell.\n\nOn one hand, advocating for their child's inclusion is important. Exclusion can be hurtful, especially for a child with disabilities. The parent might feel strongly about ensuring their child isn't left out. But the method used was yelling at another parent, which could be seen as aggressive or confrontational. Publicly shaming the other mother by implying she's embarrassed might have been harsh, even if the intent was good.\n\nThe mother of the other kids might not have realized the exclusion was happening. Maybe they didn't notice the daughter or didn't know how to include her. The parent's reaction, while out of concern for their child, could have escalated the situation instead of addressing it calmly. However, the result was that the kids did include the daughter later, so maybe the yelling had an effect.\n\nBut was it the right approach? Yelling can be perceived as aggressive and might not encourage future inclusion. The parent might have handled it better by talking to the mother privately or encouraging the kids in a different way. The partner's opinion is that they overreacted, which could be valid because public confrontation can be seen as inconsiderate, even if the intent was good.\n\nSo, the parent's intent was to protect their child from exclusion, which is understandable. However, the method of yelling might be considered wrong because it's confrontational. But considering the situation, maybe the parent's actions were justified in advocating for their child's inclusion. It's a balance between standing up for their child and handling the situation respectfully. The answer might depend on cultural norms or personal values, but generally, yelling might be seen as overstepping, making the parent in the wrong (A). But if the priority is protecting the child's inclusion, maybe not (B).\n\nI think the key points are the intent vs. the method. The intent was good, but the method was confrontational. So the parent might be in the wrong for yelling, even if their motivation was right. So answer A.\n"
