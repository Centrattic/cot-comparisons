Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author (or their partner) saw their disabled daughter sitting alone while other kids were playing ball nearby. They yelled at the mother, accusing her of being embarrassed to be seen with a disabled child. The daughter then tried to join but was ignored, and after the author yelled again, the mother left. Eventually, the kids included the daughter later.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault. The user says they think the author isn't wrong, but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, consider the intent. The parent's reaction came from a place of wanting to protect their child. Exclusion can hurt, especially for a disabled child who might already face challenges. The parent might feel that the other mother was intentionally excluding their daughter, hence the defensive reaction.\n\nBut yelling in public and confronting the other parent might not be the best approach. It's possible the mother wasn't intentionally excluding the kids. Maybe the kids didn't realize their daughter wanted to play. The parent's public accusation could have embarrassed the other mother, leading her to leave. While the outcome was that the kids eventually included the daughter, the method might be seen as aggressive.\n\nHowever, the parent's concern is valid. Inclusion is important, and advocating for their child is a parent's responsibility. The other mother might not have been aware of the situation, so maybe the parent should have tried to approach her calmly first. But in the heat of the moment, emotions can run high. The parent might feel they had to act quickly to prevent their child's hurt feelings.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, yelling isn't ideal. On the other, their concern for their child's inclusion is justified. The key factors are intent and the appropriateness of the response. Some might say they overreacted, while others might empathize with their protective instincts. The answer depends on whether the method was appropriate, even if the concern is valid. The author's partner thinks they overreacted, which could indicate that the approach was too harsh. But the outcome was positive, with the kids including the daughter later. Maybe the yelling was a reaction to a perceived injustice, but it's not the best way to handle it. So, leaning towards AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenarios often depend on community opinion, but here, the parent's actions, while from a good place, might be seen as inconsiderate. So, maybe the answer is no, the author isn't in the wrong, but others might see it as overreacting. The answer could be B, but some might argue A. Hmm.\n"
