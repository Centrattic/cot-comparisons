Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at another mother because her kids weren't including the author's disabled daughter. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's daughter was sitting outside watching other kids play. The author saw the other kids and their mother, and then yelled at the mother, accusing her of being embarrassed to be seen with a disabled child. The mother didn't respond, and the author continued, saying it's just cerebral palsy and she's not poisonous. The mother then left, and eventually the kids included the author's daughter.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author was in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The author's intention was to defend their daughter and encourage inclusion, which is understandable, especially for a parent. However, the method used was yelling and confronting the other mother in a public space. Yelling might have been seen as aggressive or confrontational, even if the motive was good.\n\nIn situations involving children and social interactions, especially with neurotypical kids, sometimes they might not include others not out of malice but due to their own social dynamics or not realizing the impact. The mother's approach could have been more effective if she addressed the children directly or found another way to encourage inclusion without confronting the other parent in a hostile manner. \n\nBut then again, as a parent, seeing their child excluded might trigger a strong emotional response. The line between defending one's child and overreacting can be thin. The fact that the daughter eventually was included suggests that the situation resolved itself, but the method might have caused unnecessary tension with the other mother. \n\nAlso, consider the public confrontation. Yelling at another parent could be seen as unprofessional and possibly embarrassing, even if the intent was to advocate for inclusion. The other mother's reaction (storming off) indicates that the approach was off-putting. \n\nOn the other hand, advocating for a child's inclusion is a valid concern. The author might have felt that standing up for their daughter was necessary, but the manner in which it was done is debatable. It's possible that the author overreacted, but the underlying issue is valid.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: the intention was good, but the method was aggressive. The author might be in the wrong for the yelling, as it could have been handled more calmly. However, the desire to include their daughter is understandable. The community might split here, but in AITA-style discussions, the method is often judged alongside the intent. Since the author used yelling, which is a strong and public confrontation, that's where the potential fault lies. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) for the way the situation was handled, even if the intent was noble.\n"
