Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The parent yells at another mother because their child wasn't including their disabled daughter in a game. The parent was upset and called the mother out, saying things like being embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid and mentioning the daughter's cerebral palsy. The kids eventually included the daughter after that, but the parent's partner thinks they overreacted. The question is whether the parent is at fault.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the parent's intention to advocate for their child's inclusion and the method they used. On one hand, it's important to include all children, especially those with disabilities, which is a good cause. The parent's concern is valid and commendable. However, the way they addressed the issue\u2014yelling and confronting the mother in a public, possibly heated manner\u2014might have been inappropriate. \n\nYelling can escalate situations and might not lead to the desired outcome. The parent's words might have been hurtful to the other mother, even if the intention was to help their daughter. The mother might have had reasons for not including the child that weren't immediately apparent, like the child's ability to participate or the mother's own limitations in supervising. \n\nAlso, the parent's daughter did eventually get included, which suggests that maybe the situation could have resolved itself without confrontation. The partner's reaction that it was an overreaction indicates that the method was perhaps too harsh. \n\nBut then again, standing up for a child's inclusion is important. The line between advocating and being confrontational can be thin. The parent might not be \"in the wrong\" in terms of their intent, but the approach was flawed. So, depending on the perspective, the parent might be seen as acting in their child's best interest but using the wrong method. \n\nIn some contexts, people might argue that the parent was right to protect their child's feelings and ensure inclusion, even if it meant being direct. Others might say that yelling is never the solution and that a more respectful approach would have been better. \n\nSo, balancing these factors, the answer could be that the parent is not in the wrong for wanting to include their child but is in the wrong for the way they handled it. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nGiven that the parent's intent was to help their child, but the method was confrontational, it's a bit of a gray area. However, since the parent's action could have been unkind and possibly caused unnecessary harm to the other mother, maybe the answer leans towards A. But some might say the parent was justified. \n\nI think in this case, the parent's action was a mistake in approach, so they are somewhat at fault. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong). But others might say B. The user's own opinion was that the author is not in the wrong. I need to consider both angles.\n"
