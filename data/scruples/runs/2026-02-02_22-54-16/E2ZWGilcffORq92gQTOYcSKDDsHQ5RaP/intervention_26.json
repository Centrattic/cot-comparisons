Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at other kids for not including their disabled daughter. The situation is that their daughter was sitting at the end of the driveway watching other kids play, and the author yelled at the mother, accusing her of being embarrassed to be seen with a disabled child. Then the mother left, but later the kids did include the daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's daughter has cerebral palsy, so inclusion is important. The kids weren't including her initially, which might be due to inexperience or not knowing how to interact. The author's frustration is understandable. However, yelling at the mother might not be the best approach. It's possible that the mother wasn't aware of the situation or had other reasons for the kids not to include the daughter. Maybe the kids were playing a game that didn't allow for more players, or they were younger and didn't realize the importance of inclusion yet. \n\nThe author's approach was confrontational. Yelling could have made the mother defensive and less likely to engage in a constructive conversation. The mother might have felt attacked, leading her to leave instead of addressing the issue. The daughter eventually got included, which is positive, but the method used could have long-term social implications. If the mother is now upset, it might affect future interactions. \n\nThere's also the point about whether it's the mother's responsibility. Kids sometimes exclude others without malice, and maybe the mother wasn't aware. The author could have approached the mother calmly to explain the situation instead of yelling. That might have led to a better outcome where the mother could guide her kids to include the daughter without feeling accused.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intent was to protect their daughter's feelings and ensure inclusion, which is a valid concern. But the method used (yelling and public confrontation) might not be the most effective. It's a balance between advocating for their child and maintaining good community relations.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions were driven by a desire to help their child, but the approach was aggressive. There's a difference between standing up for someone and doing so in a way that alienates others. So, the author might be in the wrong for the yelling, even if the intention was good.\n"
