Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at some kids for not including their disabled daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parent saw their daughter, who has cerebral palsy, sitting on the veranda watching other kids play ball. They yelled at the mother of the kids, accusing her of being embarrassed to be seen with a disabled child. Then the kids eventually included the daughter.\n\nHmm, the parent's intention was to advocate for their child, right? They wanted their daughter to be included. But they did it by yelling and confronting the other mother. The other mom didn't respond well and left. The partner thinks it was overreacting.\n\nSo the question is whether the parent was in the wrong. On one hand, advocating for inclusion is important, especially when a child is being excluded. On the other hand, yelling might have been an overreaction and could have made the situation worse. The other mother might have been unaware of the exclusion, or maybe the kids just hadn't invited the daughter yet.\n\nBut the parent could have approached it differently. Maybe talking to the other mom calmly instead of yelling. Yelling might come off as aggressive and could make the other parent defensive. The daughter eventually got included, which is positive, but the method used might have been problematic.\n\nAlso, the parent's tone and words could be seen as confrontational. The other mother might have been in a situation where she couldn't control the kids' inclusion at that moment. The parent's approach might have been more about their own frustration than the actual exclusion.\n\nSo while the intention was good, the method might have been wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because yelling isn't the best approach. But some might argue that standing up for their child isn't wrong, so maybe B. But in terms of being in the wrong, the aggressive response is the issue here. So probably A.\n"
