Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for yelling at the kids' mom because they didn't include their disabled daughter in play. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: The daughter has cerebral palsy and was sitting outside watching other kids play. The parent (the author) saw this and got upset, thinking the other kids were excluding her. They yelled at the mother, asking if she was embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. Then they said the daughter isn't poisonous. The other mom left, but eventually the daughter joined the game.\n\nSo the question is, was the author wrong to yell? Let's consider different angles. On one hand, the parent was trying to advocate for their child's inclusion. Exclusion can be hurtful, especially for kids with disabilities who might already face challenges. The parent might have felt their child's rights were being ignored. But on the other hand, yelling at the other mom might have been a harsh reaction. Publicly confronting someone like that could be seen as aggressive and not the best way to handle the situation. The other mom might have had her own reasons for the kids not including the daughter\u2014maybe they weren't aware of the daughter's needs or didn't know how to include her. The parent's approach could have made the other mom defensive, making it less likely for a positive resolution. Also, the partner thinks the author overreacted, which suggests that there's a social expectation to handle things more calmly. But then again, the parent's intention was to protect their child from exclusion. It's a tough call. Some might say the parent was justified in defending their child, while others argue that yelling isn't constructive. The outcome was that the daughter eventually joined the game, so maybe the yelling had the desired effect, but maybe there were better ways to handle it. I think the answer depends on cultural views on advocacy versus confrontation. I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the parent's intention was to include their child, but I can see arguments for A as well. Hmm.\n"
