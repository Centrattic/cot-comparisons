Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong after yelling at kids for not including their disabled daughter. The situation is that the author saw their daughter, who has cerebral palsy, sitting alone while other kids played nearby. They went out and yelled at the mother, asking if she was embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid, then added that it's just cerebral palsy and not that bad. The mother left, and later the daughter got included.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author overstepped. The daughter was being excluded, which is a problem. But the way the author handled it was by yelling at the mother. Maybe there's a better way to handle the situation without being confrontational. However, the mother's reaction suggests that maybe the kids were excluding the daughter intentionally. But the author's approach was confrontational, which might have been inappropriate. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother might have been unaware of the exclusion. The author's anger comes from a place of wanting their child included. But yelling could have made the mother defensive, leading her to leave instead of resolving the issue. The daughter eventually got included, so maybe the outcome was positive, but the method was harsh. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If they had approached the mother calmly, maybe they could have explained the situation better. Yelling might have been an overreaction even if the intention was good. So maybe answer A, the author is in the wrong for the way they handled it, even if the intent was right.\n"
