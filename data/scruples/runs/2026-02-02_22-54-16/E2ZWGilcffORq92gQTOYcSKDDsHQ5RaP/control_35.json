Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at another mother because her kids weren't including the author's disabled daughter. The daughter has cerebral palsy.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author saw two kids playing with their mom, and their daughter was watching from the driveway. The author felt excluded and decided to confront the mother by yelling. The mother was shocked, and the kids later included the disabled daughter. The partner thinks the author overreacted.\n\nSo, the main question is whether yelling at the mother was the right approach. On one hand, advocating for inclusion is important, especially for a child who might feel left out. The author's intention was to ensure their daughter wasn't excluded, which is a valid concern. However, the method of addressing the issue\u2014yelling and making an accusatory comment about being embarrassed\u2014might have been inappropriate. Public shaming or confrontational behavior can be counterproductive and might make the other person defensive instead of fostering understanding.\n\nThe mother's reaction was to storm off, which might indicate she was taken aback or hurt. The daughter eventually joined the kids, which resolved the immediate issue, but the approach could have affected the other family's willingness to include her in the future. The partner's opinion that it was an overreaction suggests that there's a different perspective here. Maybe a calmer, more direct approach could have been better, like talking to the mother privately to explain the situation.\n\nAlso, considering the daughter's feelings, the public confrontation might have embarrassed her indirectly. It's important to balance advocacy with sensitivity to others' reactions. While the intent was good, the method might have been flawed. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because yelling in public could be seen as aggressive, but some might argue B (not in the wrong) because they were defending their child. However, the community often leans towards non-confrontational methods for such situations. Hence, the answer is likely A.\n"
