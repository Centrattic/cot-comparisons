Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom was in the wrong. The scenario involves their disabled daughter being excluded from play by other kids. The key points here are the daughter's exclusion and the parent's reaction.\n\nFirst, the daughter has cerebral palsy, which is mentioned as a disability. The parent saw her sitting alone while other kids played. The parent then yelled at the other mother, accusing her of being embarrassed. The other mother didn't include the child, possibly due to ignorance or misunderstanding. The parent's intention was to advocate for their child, even if the approach was aggressive.\n\nNow, the question is whether the parent was in the wrong. On one hand, yelling might be seen as confrontational and could have escalated the situation. The parent might have felt their child was being excluded, so they acted to defend her. On the other hand, yelling in public could be seen as unprofessional or harsh, especially in front of other kids and the mother. The parent's partner thought they overreacted, adding another perspective.\n\nBut considering the context of a parent advocating for their disabled child, who might already face exclusion, the parent's actions could be viewed as a protective measure. The other mother's lack of response might indicate she was unaware of the exclusion or didn't realize the impact. The key here is the intent behind the yelling: to ensure inclusion and address what the parent saw as discrimination. While the method was aggressive, the motivation is rooted in wanting their child to be included, which is a valid concern for a parent. So, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation where the method could be debated.\n"
