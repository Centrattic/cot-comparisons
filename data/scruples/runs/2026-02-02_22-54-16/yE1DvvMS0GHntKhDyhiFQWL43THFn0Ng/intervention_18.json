We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (M0shka) is in the wrong for publicly criticizing John's art and future at a birthday party. The context is that John has been a persistent jerk, making snide comments and belittling the author. John's behavior was especially bad during a party where he insulted the author in front of others, leading to a physical altercation.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's friends accepted John despite his rudeness. John has a history of mocking the author's profession and even encouraging others to call him a \"pussy.\" His own actions, like the out-of-context comment about Einstein and correcting the author's Snapchat post, show he's pretentious and condescending. John's rejection from Nat Geo and subsequent accusation of racial discrimination, even though he's a barista with subpar photography, is probably a cry for validation. \n\nAt the party, the author tried to apologize for the rejection, but John responded with more insults. The author then took a mic to counter, calling out John's poor photography, mooching off parents, and lack of future. This led to John's father shoving the author and a fight. Now, the author is cut off from the group and considering whether to apologize.\n\nThe main question is whether the author's response was justified. While John was clearly an antagonist, the author confronted him in a public setting with his family present. Even if John was an asshole, publicly shaming him in front of his family and friends might have escalated the conflict. The author's friends already distanced themselves when they told him to leave, which suggests that maybe the group didn't support the confrontation. \n\nHowever, John had been making a habit of belittling the author in front of others, so the author might have felt cornered. The key here is the public nature of the criticism and the personal attacks (\"mooching off your parents,\" \"not amount to anything\"). Even if the author's friends found humor in John's previous jabs, the direct and harsh response might have crossed a line.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as defending their own dignity, but doing so in a confrontational and public way in front of a group might not be the most constructive. The friends' reaction (kicking them out, silence) indicates that maybe they wanted to avoid further drama. The author might not be entirely in the wrong if they were retaliating against repeated insults, but the method of confrontation could be considered unwise. \n\nIn the end, the decision hinges on whether the author had the right to publicly shame someone else's child in front of their family. Even if John was an asshole, the author's response might have been too harsh, leading to the fallout. So, I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong), but maybe with some nuance that the context had elements of provocation.\n"
