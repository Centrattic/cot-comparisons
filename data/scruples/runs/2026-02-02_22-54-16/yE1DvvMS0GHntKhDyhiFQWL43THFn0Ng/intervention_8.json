We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for publicly criticizing John's art and making a negative comment about his future in front of his friends and family. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The author is part of a close-knit group of friends who have known each other for a long time. John was a new addition, and the author had issues with him from the start, noting his rude, obnoxious, and pretentious behavior. There were previous incidents where John mocked the author's profession and even called him a 'drone' and a 'pussy' after a confrontation. The author had gained some attention on Reddit, which John resented and criticized. Then, after a rejection from National Geographic, John made a post about discrimination. At the birthday party, the author apologized to John, but John lashed out again. The author then lost their temper and made a harsh comment about John's abilities and future, leading to a physical confrontation and being kicked out of the group.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was justified. The author felt wronged by John's repeated attacks and the social dynamics. John's behavior was clearly antagonistic and disrespectful. However, the author's retort was also harsh and public, which could be seen as unkind or bullying. Even if John was an asshole, the author's choice to deliver a scathing critique in front of a group, especially including family, might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. The question is about right and wrong, not just the provocation. While the author might have been provoked, the manner of their response\u2014personal insults and public humiliation\u2014could be considered inconsiderate and potentially crossing a line, even if the underlying tension was mutual. The user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to weigh the social norms and the balance between defending oneself and being respectful. The situation is complex, but the act of publicly belittling someone's aspirations and work, regardless of their behavior, is generally frowned upon. So, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because while John's actions were unacceptable, the author's public and harsh criticism of his art and future might not be the appropriate way to handle it, especially in a group setting where others might feel caught in the middle or where the author's own behavior could be seen as contributing to the conflict.\n"
