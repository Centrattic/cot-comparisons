We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty intense. So, the person (let's call them M0shka) has known John for about a year and a half, and they didn't get along from the start. John was rude and pretentious, and M0shka had some issues with how John treated them, like calling them a drone and making snide comments. Then, at a birthday party, after a lot of tension, M0shka publicly criticized John's art and his life choices in front of his friends and family. That led to a confrontation where John's dad shoved M0shka, and M0shka got kicked out.\n\nSo, the main question is whether M0shka's actions were wrong. Let's break it down. First, John's behavior was definitely obnoxious and maybe even verbally abusive. He was making personal attacks, using nicknames, and seemed to take pleasure in belittling M0shka. That's not cool. But then, when M0shka finally snapped and publicly insulted John, even if John deserved it, was that the right move?\n\nPublic humiliation, especially in front of family and friends, is a big deal. Even if John was an asshole, responding with similar harsh criticism in a public setting could be seen as escalating the conflict. It's one thing to stand up for yourself, but doing it in a way that's aggressive and personal might cross a line. Also, the consequences were significant\u2014M0shka lost their friendship group and now has to decide if they should apologize.\n\nThe key points here are intent and proportionality. M0shka was defending themselves after a series of slights, but the public, harsh response might have been excessive. Even if John's behavior was inconsiderate and rude, the author's response could be seen as contributing to the breakdown of the social situation. It's possible that a more private confrontation or not engaging in the argument at all might have been better, even if it's hard to do in the heat of the moment.\n\nAlso, the fact that John made a roast post after being blocked might not excuse M0shka's actions. Both sides have issues, but the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author's public shaming of John, even if justified in their own mind, likely contributed to the fallout, so they might share some responsibility. However, if John was being a consistent jerk, maybe the author's frustration was valid. \n\nIn the end, it's a judgment call. But since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, and public shaming is often seen as inappropriate regardless of the provocation, the answer might lean towards A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the way they responded in a public setting. However, considering the context of ongoing harassment from John, some might argue it's mutual. But the question is about the author specifically. The act of publicly humiliating someone, even if they're an asshole, is generally considered wrong in social norms. So Answer A.\n"
