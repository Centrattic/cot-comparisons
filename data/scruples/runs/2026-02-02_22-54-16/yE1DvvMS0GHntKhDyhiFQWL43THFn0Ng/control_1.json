We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated, but I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author has known John for a while through their close friends. They mention that John was rude, pretentious, and made snide comments. The author felt targeted by John's insults, especially the nickname 'drone' and the 'pussy' remark after standing up to him. Then John started criticizing the author's Reddit posts, which the group found funny. \n\nJohn's own background is as a photographer working at Starbucks. The author thinks his work is bad. When John got rejected from a job, he blamed discrimination. The author tried to apologize, but John responded with a harsher insult in front of others, leading to the author's outburst during the party. The author publicly criticized John's art and his situation, which caused a physical altercation and being kicked out of the group. Now, the group is silent, and John blocked him.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The key points here are about the appropriateness of public criticism and the escalation of conflict. Even if John was being an asshole, responding in front of his friends and family by calling him out so directly and harshly might have been too much. The author's statement was pretty aggressive and personal, using phrases like \"your pictures fucking suck\" and predicting he won't amount to much. That's not just a critique of the art but an attack on his character and future. \n\nIn social situations, especially with close friends and family, public shaming or belittling someone can be seen as crossing a line, regardless of their behavior. The author might have been defending their own honor after repeated insults, but the way they did it was confrontational and likely hurtful. The fact that it led to being kicked out and blocked suggests that even the friends who were making jokes about John might have felt the author's response was too harsh. \n\nAlso, the author's initial comments about John's job and personal situation could be considered mean-spirited. While John's behavior was problematic, the author's response may have been unprofessional and disrespectful, even if they had a history of being insulted. \n\nOn the other hand, John's behavior was definitely inconsiderate and possibly humiliating. The author might have felt disrespected and frustrated. But does that justify the public put-down? In most social norms, even when someone is an antagonist, responding with public insults isn't considered acceptable, especially if it's personal. The author could have tried to address the issue privately or ignored the provocations instead of escalating in a group setting. \n\nSo considering both sides, the author's actions, while understandable in emotion, were probably not the right approach. They contributed to the conflict escalation and public humiliation, which is why the answer is likely A for Yes, they are in the wrong.\n"
