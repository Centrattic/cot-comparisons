We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves some personal conflicts and a confrontation at a party. \n\nFirst, the author has been part of a close-knit group of friends and didn't like John, who joined the group. John was rude and pretentious, and he often mocked the author's job as a Biomed Engineer. The author felt targeted and called a derogatory nickname by John. Then, after John got rejected from his dream job, he made a post about discrimination, which the author found insincere. At the birthday party, the author tried to apologize but John responded with a harsh insult. This led the author to publicly insult John's work and personal situation, resulting in a physical altercation and being kicked out.\n\nSo, the main question is about whether the author's response was justified. The key points here are the initial dislike towards John, the ongoing insults and mockery from John, the author's attempts to apologize, and the final confrontation. \n\nJohn's behavior was clearly problematic. He was rude, condescending, and used pretentious remarks. He also attacked the author's character by giving a demeaning nickname and making personal jabs. However, the author's response was to publicly denounce John's work and personal circumstances in front of his family and friends. Even though John had been an ass, the author's approach might have been overly harsh. Public shaming, even in response to provocation, can be seen as crossing a line, especially when it's personal and derogatory. \n\nThe author's actions led to a physical fight and alienated their friends. While John was the instigator, the author's response was not measured. Instead of addressing the issue calmly, they chose to retaliate with a public insult. In such situations, even if the other person is at fault, the way the author handled it might have made the situation worse. The friends' reaction (kicking out the author) suggests that the group saw the author's behavior as the bigger problem, possibly because escalating the conflict in front of others is socially unacceptable. \n\nAlso, the author's pre-existing dislike of John might have influenced their actions. It's possible that the author was holding onto past grievances and used the opportunity to lash out, which can be seen as reacting from a place of personal resentment rather than addressing the immediate issue constructively. \n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, while John was an asshole, the author's public humiliation of John in a confrontational manner is not advisable. It's important to consider the context and the consequences of such actions. The author might not be entirely in the wrong for defending themselves, but their response was excessive and led to a breakdown in the group dynamic. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they escalated the situation with public and personal insults, even if provoked. However, there's a nuance here since John was also an ass. But since the question is about the author's actions, the answer remains A.\n"
