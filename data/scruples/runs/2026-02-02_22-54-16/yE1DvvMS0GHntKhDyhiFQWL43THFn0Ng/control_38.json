We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty intense. So, the user is asking if they did something wrong by publicly telling John that his art is bad and he won't amount to much in life, especially in front of his friends and family. \n\nFirst, let's recap the key points. The user has a close-knit group of friends who all know each other since childhood. John was added to the group about 1.5 years ago. The user didn't like John from the start, citing his rude and pretentious behavior. There are examples like correcting others in a condescending way, using terms like \"gridiron\" instead of \"college football.\" The friends accepted him, but the user didn't. \n\nThen there was a party where John got tipsy and started a tirade about the user being a \"drone\" in a rat race, making fun of his engineering work. This led to ongoing teasing and nicknames, which the user found offensive. The user tried to stand up to John but ended up being called a \"pussy.\" John also mocked the user's Reddit posts, which the user had some success with. \n\nJohn is a photographer working as a barista, with mediocre skills according to the user. He got rejected from a job and claimed it was due to racial discrimination. At the birthday party, the user tried to apologize for the job rejection, but John responded aggressively, making condescending remarks about the user's intelligence and life choices. The user then publicly insulted John's work and life choices during a mic check, leading to a physical confrontation and the user being kicked out.\n\nNow, the user is asking if they're the asshole here. The question is about whether their response was justified. \n\nFrom a social perspective, publicly humiliating someone, even if they've been a jerk, is generally frowned upon. While John was clearly an antagonist, the user escalated the situation by making a public, harsh critique in front of John's family and friends. Even if John was a difficult person, the user's response was aggressive and likely contributed to the breakdown of the friendship. \n\nHowever, the user might argue that John's behavior was inexcusable and that they were defending themselves after being mocked for so long. The user also tried to apologize for the job rejection, which John turned into an opportunity for more insults. But the manner in which the user responded\u2014publicly shaming John during a mic check, mentioning his personal failings, and predicting he wouldn't amount to much\u2014crosses a line. \n\nIt's important to consider the context: they're in a group of friends where tensions have been building for months. The user might feel justified, but in most social norms, even if someone is an asshole, responding with public shaming and personal attacks is not the right approach. The user could have addressed the issue privately, set boundaries without attacking John's character in front of others. \n\nThe fact that the user was kicked out and the group hasn't spoken to them since suggests that their action was seen as going too far. Even if John was at fault, the user's response likely made things worse. \n\nSo, while John was definitely a problematic person, the user's actions during the party were inappropriate. They chose a public, aggressive confrontation that alienated not just John but possibly the entire group. The user's own words were harsh and disrespectful, even if John deserved it. In terms of social responsibility, the user is in the wrong for how they handled the situation, regardless of John's behavior.\n"
