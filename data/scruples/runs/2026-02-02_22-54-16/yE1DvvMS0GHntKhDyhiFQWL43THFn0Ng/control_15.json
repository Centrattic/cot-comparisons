We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is pretty intense. The main points are that the author (let's call him M0shka) was part of a friend group that included John, who he found irritating. John was rude and pretentious, and there were ongoing conflicts, especially after M0shka became popular on Reddit. \n\nJohn's behavior included belittling M0shka's career, using derogatory nicknames, and making offensive comments. When John was rejected from a job, he made a defensive post about discrimination. At a party, John insulted M0shka in front of others, which led to M0shka publicly roasting John's art and future, causing a physical altercation and the group splitting up.\n\nSo, the question is whether M0shka is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, John definitely had a lot of problematic behavior. He was rude, condescending, and made personal attacks. He targeted M0shka's career and personal life, which is unkind. His own actions were clearly inconsiderate and insulting. \n\nHowever, M0shka's response was to publicly humiliate John in front of his family and friends. Even though John had been an ass, M0shka's comments were harsh and personal, attacking his work, his living situation, and predicting his future failure. This could be seen as crossing a line, even if provoked. Public shaming can be a significant issue, regardless of the provocation.\n\nBut in this context, it's a group of friends who've known each other a long time, and M0shka was part of the group that accepted John. The fact that M0shka waited until a party to confront him publicly, especially in a way that escalated to a physical fight, might be where the problem lies. Even if John was an asshole, the appropriate response might have been a private conversation or walking away, not a public roast that caused a scene.\n\nOn the other hand, the user might argue that John's constant harassment and the final insult at the party justified M0shka's reaction. The line between defending oneself and overreacting can be blurry here. However, the key point is whether M0shka's actions were proportionate. Deliberately humiliating someone in front of their family and friends, leading to a fight and the group breaking up, is a major escalation.\n\nIn AITA discussions, often the judgment comes down to whether the person's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. Even if the other person was at fault, the responder's actions might still be considered the wrong move. So, while John was an asshole, M0shka's public humiliation might be the final straw that caused the group to distance from him. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because, despite the provocation, the public and harsh response was inappropriate and led to significant fallout. The author's actions, while understandable in the moment, were unproductive and contributed to the breakdown of the friendship group.\n"
