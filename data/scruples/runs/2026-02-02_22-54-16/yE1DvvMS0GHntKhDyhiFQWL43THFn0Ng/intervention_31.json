We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's take a look at this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after a confrontation at a birthday party. The author's main argument is that John is an obnoxious, pretentious person who started a group of friends and constantly mocked the author for being a Biomed Engineer. John also made claims about the author's work and even called him a \"drone\" and a \"pussy\" after the author asked him to stop. When the author confronted John about his rejection from Nat Geo, John insulted him again in front of his family and friends. In response, the author publicly criticized John's art, his job, and his living situation, leading to a physical altercation.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, John's behavior was clearly toxic. He was rude, condescending, and persistent in his mockery, which likely made the author feel disrespected. The group initially accepted John, but the author's friends were upset after the incident. The author's response, while harsh, might be seen as a reaction to ongoing provocation. However, public humiliation, even if deserved, can be a serious action. The author could have chosen to address the issue privately or walk away instead of escalating the situation in front of everyone. The physical shoving by John's dad and others suggests that the confrontation was intense and possibly crossed a line. \n\nBut considering the context, the author's actions were a direct response to John's repeated insults and the hostile environment he created. The friends' subsequent silence and John blocking the author indicate that the group might not support John's behavior. The author could argue that they were defending themselves after being mocked for so long. However, delivering the same kind of harsh criticism in public, especially targeting personal aspects like mooching off parents, might have been unwise. There's a nuance here between defending oneself and adding further insult. \n\nIn many social situations, even if someone is an asshole, responding with similar aggression can damage relationships. The author might not be entirely in the wrong given the provocation, but they did contribute to the escalation. The answer depends on whether the public confrontation was seen as a justified response or an overreaction. Since the friends were already on John's side in calling the author a \"pussy,\" maybe they saw the author's action as standing up for themselves. However, the public nature and the specific comments about John's personal life might make it harder for the author to be seen as entirely without fault. \n\nSo, the author's situation is complicated. They were provoked, but their response might have been too harsh for the setting. The key point is whether the public humiliation was necessary. The answer is probably A because the author's actions led to a physical altercation and destroyed relationships, even if John was an asshole. But if the community values standing up for oneself, maybe B. However, the question is about being in the wrong. Publicly humiliating someone, even if they're an ass, can be seen as wrong. So I think the answer is A.\n"
