We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for publicly telling someone his art is bad and that he won't amount to much. The situation is quite detailed.\n\nFirst, the author describes John as rude, pretentious, and someone who constantly mocked him. There was a history of John belittling the author's profession and dismissing his Reddit posts. Then, John got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about racism. The author tried to apologize for the rejection, but John responded angrily, calling the author a \"drone\" and making condescending remarks about his work. At the birthday party, the author snapped and pointed out John's flaws in front of his family and friends.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault here. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but they want my opinion. Let me break it down. \n\nJohn's behavior was definitely toxic and hurtful. He targeted the author repeatedly, used derogatory nicknames, and brought up personal issues. The author had apologized for the Reddit part, but John's response escalated the situation. \n\nHowever, the author's retaliation at the party was also harsh. Publicly humiliating someone in front of their family and friends, even if they've been an asshole, can be a problem. The author called John's work terrible, criticized his job and living situation, and predicted he wouldn't amount to anything. That's pretty strong language, and even if justified in some way, it's confrontational and could have serious repercussions.\n\nThe key points here are about proportionality and the context of the conflict. While John's actions were inconsiderate and contributed to the tension, the author's response was a direct attack that might have crossed a line. Even if the author felt wronged, calling someone's entire future futile in a public setting is likely to be seen as harsh, regardless of the provocation. \n\nBut the user is arguing that the author isn't in the wrong. Maybe because John's behavior was so bad that the author's outburst was a justified reaction. However, the method of responding could be questioned. The author's friends then sided against him, leading to being kicked out and blocked. The author's actions, while perhaps understandable, might have been too aggressive in a sensitive environment (a birthday party with family present). \n\nIn terms of social norms, even if someone is an asshole, publicly tearing them down in a personal and harsh manner is generally frowned upon. The author's statement was a combination of personal attack and public humiliation. So, while John was likely an asshole who contributed to the conflict, the author's response might still be considered in the wrong because it was an aggressive and public rebuke. However, in some contexts, if the group's dynamic was very informal and confrontational, maybe not. But given that it's a surprise party and the author was handed a mic to share a memory, using that opportunity to attack John could be seen as crossing a line. The friends' reaction (kicking the author out) suggests that they found the author's actions unacceptable, possibly indicating that the author is in the wrong. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of self-defense in the interaction. The author was being called a \"pussy\" and faced with threats, so there's a history of being targeted. The final trigger was John's comment about the author's mother and the comparison to art. The author's response was a culmination of past grievances. \n\nIn conclusion, while John's behavior was inexcusable, the author's public and harsh response might have been the last straw. The author had the chance to address the issue privately but chose a public confrontation, which is likely to be seen as inappropriate, even if provoked. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong, because the method of response was too aggressive and public, regardless of the provocation.\n"
