We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details carefully. The author is part of a close-knit group of friends and a new member, John, who they found rude and pretentious. John started an hour-long tirade about the author's job, calling them a drone and dismissing their work. He kept roasting the author over time, even after they asked to stop. The author tried to apologize for a comment they made about John's job rejection, but John responded with more insults, leading the author to lose their temper and call out John's art and his situation, resulting in a physical altercation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. John's behavior seems pretty aggressive and condescending. He's been openly mocking the author for a long time, using derogatory nicknames and making personal attacks. The author tried to apologize when they thought they were being insensitive, but John escalated the situation by continuing to belittle them. The author's response was during a party with friends and family, where they were handed a mic and used that opportunity to confront John. \n\nThe key points here are about the appropriateness of the author's response. While John's actions were definitely inconsiderate and hostile, the author's reply was direct and included personal criticisms. Even if the author felt provoked, publicly calling someone a failure in front of their family and friends could be seen as harsh. However, the author was defending themselves against repeated mockery and disrespect from John. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, John started the conflict with his negative behavior, but the author's response might have been the last straw. The question is whether the author overstepped. The author did express their dislike for the nickname and tried to apologize, but when John continued being an asshole, the author's outburst was a reaction to that. \n\nHowever, regardless of the provocation, publicly humiliating someone can be unwise, even if the person is being an asshole. The author might have a right to stand up for themselves, but the method could be questioned. The answer depends on the context of their prior interactions and the social setting. The author's actions were a direct response to a history of disrespect from John, but the public nature of the confrontation and the specific words used could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nSo, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. They might be considering the provocation as a factor. But in terms of whether it's a justified response, it's a bit of a gray area. However, from a typical \"Am I the Asshole?\" perspective, the author's public humiliation of John might make them the asshole, even if John was the initial instigator. The consensus often leans towards taking responsibility for actions, even when wronged. But if John was being genuinely disrespectful, maybe the author's response is understandable. I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong (A) because of the public nature and the harsh words, but I could also see the argument that John's behavior made the author's response a necessary defense (B). The final answer might be A because the author escalated the situation publicly.\n"
