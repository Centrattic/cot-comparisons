We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the details.\n\nFirst, the author is part of a close-knit group of friends where John was recently added. The author didn't like John from the start because he was rude, pretentious, and obnoxious. There are examples of John correcting others in a condescending way, like changing \"Einstein\" to \"EinSHTein\" and using \"gridiron\" instead of \"college football.\" The friends accepted him, which the author finds confusing.\n\nThen there's the incident at a get-together where John, after getting tipsy, attacked the author for being a \"drone\" in the \"rat race,\" implying the author's career as a Biomed Engineer lacks creativity. This led to a nickname that the author disliked, and John continued to roast the author's profession, calling it easy and not valuing the author's work. The author tried to tell John to stop but was mocked as a \"pussy\" when refusing a fight, which escalated the conflict.\n\nLater, John got rejected from his dream job at National Geographic and blamed it on discrimination because of his skin color. The author tried to apologize for the rejection, but John responded angrily, in front of the author's girlfriend, who left upset. During a birthday party, the author took a mic to confront John, saying his art sucks and he won't amount to much, mentioning his age, job, living with parents, and using a phone camera as a jab. This led to a physical altercation where the author was kicked out, and the friend group has been silent since. John blocked the author on social media and made a roast post.\n\nThe question is, is the author in the wrong (A) or not (B)?\n\nLet me consider both sides. The author's perspective is that John has been an asshole for a long time, constantly belittling them and others. The insults from John were directed at the author's career and personal conduct. The author felt provoked and retaliated, which led to the fallout. On the other hand, even if John was an obnoxious, pretentious person, the author publicly insulted him in front of his friends and family, which can be very hurtful and damaging. The author's response was harsh, especially given the context of a family gathering where public humiliation might be particularly unkind.\n\nWhile John's behavior was inexcusable and the author has reasons to be upset, yelling in front of others and making personal attacks, even if true, might be seen as crossing a line. The question is whether the author's response was appropriate. Public shaming and harsh criticism, even in retaliation, can be considered inconsiderate and disrespectful, regardless of the target's behavior. The fact that the author's girlfriend was present and left because of John's comments suggests that the environment was already tense. The author's decision to use the mic to confront John escalated the situation further, leading to social consequences.\n\nSo, even though John was a jerk, the author's actions contributed to the conflict and alienated the group. It's possible the author was also a victim of John's bullying but responding with equally harsh public criticism might make them at least partially responsible. The key point is whether the author's response was justified. The author's message is that John's art is bad, but they did it in a heated moment during a party. The severity of the comment (\"not going to amount to anything\") is quite strong and might be seen as attacking John's self-worth rather than just his art. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's valid to feel wronged, responding in a way that publicly shames someone else can lead to being seen as the aggressor. The author could have addressed the issues privately instead of in front of others. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for the way they handled the confrontation, even if John's behavior was unacceptable.\n"
