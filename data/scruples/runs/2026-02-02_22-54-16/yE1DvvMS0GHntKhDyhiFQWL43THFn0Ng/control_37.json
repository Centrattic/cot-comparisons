We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a group of friends, including John, who's been causing some issues.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and their friends have known each other since childhood, and John was recently added to the group. The author didn't like John from the start because he was rude, pretentious, and made condescending remarks. John started a long tirade when the author mentioned being a Biomed Engineer, mocked him, called him a \"drone,\" and later a \"pussy\" when the author got defensive. John also criticized the author's Reddit posts, which were gaining some attention.\n\nThen there's the incident at the birthday party. The author apologized for John's job rejection, but John responded angrily, belittling the author's career and making a derogatory comment about his art. The author took the mic and publicly insulted John's art, his job, his living situation, and predicted he'd amount to nothing. This led to a physical altercation and the author being kicked out, with the group avoiding them since.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main issue is public humiliation and the escalation of conflict. Even if John was rude and provocative, the author's response was harsh and confrontational. Telling someone their art sucks and that they won't amount to much in front of family and friends is a significant breach. It's one thing to stand up for yourself, but attacking someone's livelihood and personal circumstances in a public setting could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nJohn's behavior was inconsiderate and disrespectful, contributing to the conflict. However, the author's choice to respond with such a scathing public critique might have been unwise, regardless of John's provocations. The author could have addressed the issues privately or chosen not to engage. Public insults, even if justified in their eyes, often lead to worse outcomes and can be hurtful. \n\nThe friends' reactions post-incident\u2014getting the author kicked out and not reaching out\u2014suggest that the group found the author's response unacceptable. While John had flaws, the author's actions might have been the final straw. So, the author could be considered \"asshole\" because they escalated the situation publicly, even if provoked. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
