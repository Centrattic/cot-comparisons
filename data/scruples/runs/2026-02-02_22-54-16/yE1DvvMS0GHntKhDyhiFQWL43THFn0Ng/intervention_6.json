We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author told John, a friend in their group, that his art sucks and he won't amount to anything in front of his friends and family. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author's group of friends accepted John despite his rude and pretentious behavior. John has been making fun of the author's profession and nickname, leading to tension. John's been rejected from a dream job and made a controversial post about it. At the party, after an apology from the author, John made a derogatory comment, prompting the author to retaliate by criticizing John's work and personal situation in front of others, which escalated into a physical altercation.\n\nSo, the key points here are the initial interactions where John was rude and the author felt targeted. John's behavior seems to be the root cause of the conflict. The author tried to apologize and even handled a situation where the group was making fun of them earlier. However, John's response was aggressive and disrespectful, leading the author to lash out.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions were a direct response to John's provocation. But even if provoked, publicly calling someone's work bad and predicting failure might cross a line. The author did this in front of friends and family, which is a sensitive setting. While John's behavior was clearly toxic and hurtful, the author's response could have been more constructive. Maybe using the mic to express frustration, but the harsh language about John's future and personal life might be too much, even if justified by the provocation. \n\nAlso, the fact that John was a barista and a photographer with a history of poor reception of his art might mean the author's critique isn't entirely unfounded. However, the way it was delivered publicly and the emotional context (party with family present) probably made it worse. The author could have handled it without being so direct, maybe by ignoring or confronting John privately rather than in a group. \n\nBut considering John's previous behavior, including the insults and the aggression when the author stood up for themselves, the author might feel that their actions were a justified response to ongoing disrespect. However, in terms of right and wrong, even if provoked, publicly humiliating someone could be seen as wrong. The author's statement was harsh, but the responsibility also lies with John for his own actions. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to weigh both sides. The author's actions were a reaction to years of insults and recent aggression, but the method was confrontational in a public setting. So, while John's behavior is definitely at fault, the author's public criticism might not be the right approach. The answer here could be A (yes), but I'm a bit torn. Alternatively, maybe it's a shared responsibility. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nPublicly embarrassing someone, even if they are a jerk, is generally considered wrong. The author could have addressed the issue without escalating it in front of others. Even if John's dad shoved them and others supported the author, the initial statement was the catalyst. So, the author might be in the wrong for responding in a way that caused a public confrontation and further damaged the group dynamics. \n\nTherefore, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to make sure. Let me check again: was the author's response a direct and proportionate follow-up? John insulted the author's work and made personal jabs. The author then criticized John's work and personal situation, which is a form of retaliation. Even if justified, the timing and place (family party) made it inappropriate. So, the author overstepped by making a public statement in that context, hence A.\n"
