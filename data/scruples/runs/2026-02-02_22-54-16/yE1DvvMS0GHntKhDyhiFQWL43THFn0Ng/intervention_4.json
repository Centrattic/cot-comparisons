We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author confronting John, a friend who works as a barista and claims to be a photographer, about his poor reception in the job he applied for and his art. The author was already annoyed by John's behavior and had a history of conflict, but the final incident at the birthday party led to a physical altercation and social fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's friends accepted John into the group despite his obnoxious behavior. John often criticized the author's career choices and made personal attacks, which led to the author feeling targeted. The author's response at the party was direct and harsh, mentioning John's lack of success, his job, his living situation, and the quality of his art. This caused a confrontation.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's actions were justified. On one hand, John was being rude and pretentious, making personal jabs. The author might have felt provoked and decided to retaliate. On the other hand, publicly humiliating someone, even if they're an asshole, can be seen as crossing a line. The author's comments were not just about the art but also about John's personal qualities and future, which could be harsh and unnecessary. \n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but I should consider both perspectives. The problem is that while John's behavior was clearly problematic, the author's response used aggressive language and made a personal attack, which might have been the catalyst for the conflict. Even if John deserved it, the way the author addressed the issue in front of family and friends could be seen as contributing to the escalation.\n\nAlso, the author's friends were already mocking John's behavior, but when the author took the mic to confront him directly, it turned the situation into a public shaming. The friends might have been okay with roasting John among themselves as a joke, but the author's direct criticism in a sensitive setting (birthday party) with emotional stakes (John's rejection) might have been too much. \n\nThe author's statement about John not amounting to anything is a strong judgment call. It's not just a critique of his art but a prediction of his future, which is unkind and can be seen as a personal attack. Even if true, delivering it in that context and with that tone could be harmful and disrespectful. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the author had the choice to either let it go or address it privately. Publicly confronting John with such harsh words, especially after prior tensions, likely made the author partially responsible for the conflict. The friends distancing themselves after the incident might indicate that while they found John annoying, the author's actions were too extreme, leading to the group breaking apart.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong because their response was overly harsh and public, even if provoked. However, the situation is complex because John was an asshole. But the key is whether the author's actions were the wrong doing, and in that case, the direct and public criticism that led to a fight probably makes them AITA.\n"
