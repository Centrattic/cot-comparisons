We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a person named John who's been part of a friend group for about a year and a half. The author has had a lot of issues with John's behavior over time\u2014John is described as rude, pretentious, and condescending. There's a history of John mocking the author's profession and making personal attacks.\n\nThe key incident here is when the author, after a series of provocations and a birthday party where John makes a derogatory comment in front of others, publicly criticizes John's art and life choices. The author then gets into a physical altercation and is kicked out of the group. Now, the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. John's behavior over time has been toxic and disrespectful. He's repeatedly targeted the author, using nicknames like 'drone' and 'pussy', and made belittling remarks about the author's career. The author tried to apologize after John's rejection from a job, but John responded with further insults. The author's outburst was a direct response to John's public humiliation and ongoing taunts.\n\nHowever, the author's response was also harsh and public. Telling someone their art sucks in front of their family and friends, especially when it's a sensitive topic for them, is a significant social faux pas. Even if John had been rude before, the author's choice to escalate the conflict in such a public manner could be seen as crossing a line. The author's statement about John not amounting to anything in life is particularly harsh, even if it was a reaction to John's provocations.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, John's behavior was inexcusable and contributed to the conflict. On the other hand, the author's response, while perhaps a reaction to provocation, was a public and harsh condemnation that could be seen as equally disrespectful. The author might have had a right to feel wronged, but the method of addressing it\u2014publicly and confrontationally\u2014might not be the most appropriate way to handle it, even in the context of a heated argument.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of mutual accountability. If John's behavior was ongoing and hurtful, the author's frustration is understandable. However, responding with the same level of public criticism and personal attacks might not be a constructive resolution. The author's actions could have been a justified emotional reaction rather than a measured response, which complicates the judgment.\n\nIn some contexts, defending oneself against ongoing abuse might be seen as necessary, but the author's choice to escalate it in front of a large group, including family, could be seen as exacerbating the situation. The result was a physical altercation and the breakdown of the friendship group, which is a significant consequence.\n\nSo, considering all factors: John's prior bad behavior and the author's right to be upset, but the author's public and harsh response, leading to a physical fight and social fallout. The answer might hinge on whether the author's actions were a proportionate response to John's provocations. Given that the author's statement was a direct attack on John's personal worth and career in a public setting, it's possible that the author overstepped, even if John was the initial aggressor. So, the author might be in the wrong (A), but it's a nuanced case.\n"
