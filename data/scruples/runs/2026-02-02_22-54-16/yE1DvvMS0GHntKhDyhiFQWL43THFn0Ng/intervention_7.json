We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author, M0shka, has been in a close-knit group of friends for years and recently added John. From the start, John's behavior was rude, pretentious, and condescending. There are examples like correcting a friend's mention of Einstein and mocking the term \"college football.\" The friends accepted John despite this, which upset M0shka. \n\nThen, John started roasting M0shka's career as a Biomed Engineer during a get-together when he was tipsy. He called him a \"drone\" and even challenged him to a fight after M0shka told him to shut up. That escalated the situation, and John started mocking M0shka's Reddit posts when he gained some attention. \n\nJohn's own situation is that he's a barista claiming to be a photographer, with a poorly received portfolio. He got rejected from his dream job and made a controversial Instagram post about discrimination. At the birthday party, M0shka apologized for the rejection, but John responded with a harsh insult in front of M0shka's date, leading to M0shka's outburst where he called out John's lack of success and criticized his art. This led to a physical altercation and being kicked out. Now, the friends have been silent, and John has blocked M0shka.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to evaluate the situation. While John's behavior was clearly problematic and disrespectful, M0shka's response was public and potentially humiliating. Even if John's actions were infuriating, responding with personal attacks in front of his family and friends might be crossing a line. The friends initially accepted John despite his flaws, but M0shka's direct criticism could have caused the group to distance themselves. \n\nHowever, considering the context of repeated insults and the trigger of John's discriminatory post, M0shka might feel justified in defending himself. But the key is whether his response was appropriate. Publicly calling someone out mid-conversation, even if they're an asshole, can be seen as harsh and unkind. \n\nThe question is if M0shka's actions were a proportionate response. He was defending his own dignity and pointing out John's unrealistic self-perception and the rejection from the job. But the way he did it\u2014saying \"your pictures suck\" and \"you won't amount to anything\"\u2014might have been too direct and hurtful, especially in front of others. \n\nIn many social situations, even if someone is an a**hole, publicly humiliating them can damage relationships. The friends might have felt that M0shka escalated the conflict beyond what was acceptable. So, even though John was in the wrong, M0shka might have overstepped by his public criticism and harsh language. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A, yes, the author is in the wrong. But I need to make sure. The user is arguing B, so I should check if the situation is a self-defense of reputation. The user's friends might have been on M0shka's side, but the way he expressed it was inappropriate. So, the balance here is tricky. However, the act of publicly calling out someone's failures and insulting their work, especially after previous tensions, is likely to be seen as crossing the line. Therefore, the author's actions, while understandable, were not appropriate, making them at least partially in the wrong.\n"
