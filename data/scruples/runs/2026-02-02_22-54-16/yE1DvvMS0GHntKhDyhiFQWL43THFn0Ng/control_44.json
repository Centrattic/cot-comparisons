We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is part of a close-knit group of friends who accepted John, even though the author didn't like him. John's behavior was rude and pretentious, and he often mocked the author's profession. The author tried to apologize after John's job rejection, but John lashed out again. At a party, the author confronted John publicly, leading to a fight and being kicked out.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. John's behavior was certainly obnoxious and offensive. He repeatedly mocked the author, used derogatory nicknames, and made personal attacks. The author tried to apologize, which shows some effort to de-escalate. However, the author's response at the party was a public humiliation of John, which might have been the last straw. \n\nPublicly insulting someone, even if they deserve it, can be seen as inconsiderate and aggressive. The author's comments were harsh and personal, such as mentioning John's job, living with parents, and predicting he wouldn't amount to anything. While John's actions were inexcusable, the author's response could be seen as crossing a line, especially in front of family and friends. \n\nBut considering the context of ongoing harassment and the fact that John provoked the situation, some might argue the author had a right to defend themselves. However, the method\u2014public shaming and personal attacks\u2014might still be considered wrong. \n\nSo, the author's actions were a response to provocation, but the way they handled it (public insult) could be seen as the wrong approach. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the author's response was a direct retaliation in a heated situation, maybe the blame isn't entirely on them. \n\nAlternatively, the author had a choice in how to respond. Even if provoked, publicly humiliating someone in front of their family and friends is generally considered wrong. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong for their response.\n"
