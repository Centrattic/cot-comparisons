We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, let's call them M0shka, has been in a friendship group with John for about a year and a half. John is described as rude, pretentious, and obnoxious. There were some incidents where John made condescending comments, especially towards M0shka's career as a Biomed Engineer. John also started calling M0shka \"drone\" and \"pussy\" after some arguments. Then, when M0shka became popular on Reddit, John criticized that too.\n\nJohn is a photographer who works at Starbucks and got rejected from a job he wanted. At a birthday party, John lashed out at M0shka in front of his family and friends, leading M0shka to publicly insult John's art, his job, and his future. After that, there was a physical altercation, and now the group is broken up.\n\nThe question is whether M0shka is in the wrong for their response. \n\nSo, first, I need to consider the context. John had a history of being rude and condescending. He made personal attacks on M0shka, including derogatory nicknames and belittling their work. However, M0shka's response was to publicly shame John in front of his family and friends, which escalated the situation. Even if John was an asshole, the direct question is whether M0shka's actions cross the line.\n\nPublicly humiliating someone, especially in front of their family and friends, can be seen as a breach of social etiquette. Even if John was an obnoxious person, the manner in which M0shka responded might be considered overly harsh and unkind, regardless of John's behavior. \n\nHowever, some might argue that M0shka were defending themselves against ongoing personal attacks and that there was a pattern of John's behavior that justified some level of confrontation. But the key point here is the public and harsh nature of the response. \n\nAlso, the fact that M0shka had a history of being made fun of by John, and then responded in kind, might make them equally at fault. In many social contexts, responding to insults with more insults, especially in a public setting, is considered inappropriate, even if the other person was being a jerk. \n\nSo, considering that the author publicly insulted John in front of his family and friends, which led to a physical altercation and the breakdown of the friendship group, it seems that the author's actions contributed to the escalation. Therefore, they might be in the wrong.\n"
