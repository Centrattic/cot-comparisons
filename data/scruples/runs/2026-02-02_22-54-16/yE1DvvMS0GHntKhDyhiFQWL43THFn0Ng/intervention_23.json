We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author was part of a friend group that included John, who they found obnoxious and pretentious. John would constantly mock the author's career and make derogatory comments. The author tried to apologize after John's job rejection, but John responded with more insults, leading the author to lash out in front of John's family and friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. John had a history of being rude and condescending, targeting the author's profession and even calling them a \"drone\" and a \"pussy.\" The author tried to apologize after John's rejection, which might have been an effort to de-escalate. However, John's response was even more aggressive. In the party incident, John made a derogatory comment in front of others, which caused a girl to leave. The author then publicly criticized John's work and life choices, leading to a physical confrontation.\n\nThe key factors here are the history of conflict, the escalation, and the public nature of the confrontation. The author's actions were a direct response to John's insults during a tense situation. However, publicly humiliating someone, even in retaliation, can be problematic. The author used harsh language and made personal attacks, which might be seen as crossing a line regardless of John's behavior.\n\nOn one hand, John's behavior was clearly inappropriate and provocative. On the other, the author's response in front of family and friends could be seen as unkind and contributing to the breakdown of the friendship. The question is whether the author's response was a justified reaction to provocation or if it was an overstep.\n\nIn social dynamics, even if someone is an asshole, responding with public humiliation might not be the right approach. The author's actions likely damaged relationships and caused lasting consequences. While John was in the wrong in his behavior towards the author, the author's choice to confront him in a hostile manner in front of others could be seen as equally wrong, even if it was a reaction.\n\nSo, considering the context of mutual provocation and the public nature of the conflict, the author might still be in the wrong for their response, even if John was the initial aggressor. The answer might lean towards A, but there's nuance here. However, in terms of social responsibility, the author's actions contributed to the escalation and the fallout.\n"
