We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is that the author, who's part of a close-knit group of friends, has a new member named John. John is described as rude, pretentious, and obnoxious. The author and others in the group have had multiple run-ins with John, who constantly belittles the author's career in engineering and mocks his Reddit posts. John's behavior has led to nicknames and ongoing conflict.\n\nThen, at a birthday party, after some prior tensions, the author lashes out publicly by criticizing John's art and his life choices in front of his family and friends. This leads to a confrontation and the author being kicked out of the group. The author is now wondering if they were in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: John's behavior was toxic and hurtful. He mocked the author repeatedly, which built up over time. The author's response was a public humiliation of John in a very personal and harsh way. The question is whether the author's actions were justified.\n\nOn one hand, John was clearly an asshole, making the author's life miserable with his constant put-downs. The author might have felt that the final straw was John's discriminatory comment and the public roast. But on the other hand, responding with a harsh public critique, especially in front of family and friends, could be seen as crossing a line, regardless of the provocation. Even if John deserved it, the author's choice to confront him in such a public and demeaning manner might not be the right approach, especially in a social setting where others are present.\n\nThe author's actions led to immediate consequences, like the physical altercation and being blocked. The friends distanced from the author, which suggests that even if they agreed with John's behavior, the author's response was too extreme. In terms of social dynamics, public shaming can be damaging and might escalate conflicts. So, while John's behavior was inexcusable, the author's decision to retaliate in such an aggressive and public manner might make them at least partially responsible for the breakdown in the group.\n\nTherefore, considering the context, the author is in the wrong because they chose a confrontational and public response that exacerbated the situation. It's possible to address someone's behavior without resorting to harsh public criticism that targets their personal life and career. The author's actions, while perhaps understandable as a reaction, were not the right approach. So the answer would be A.\n"
