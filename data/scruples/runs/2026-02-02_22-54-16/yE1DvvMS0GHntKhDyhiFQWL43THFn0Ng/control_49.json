We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, let's call him M0shka, is part of a close-knit group of friends. They added a new member, John, who he didn't like because of his pretentious and rude behavior. Over time, there were conflicts, including John making fun of M0shka's job and their interactions escalating.\n\nThe key event is at the birthday party where M0shka publicly insulted John in front of his family and friends, leading to a physical altercation and the aftermath of being blocked and ostracized. The question is whether M0shka is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. John's behavior was clearly obnoxious and rude, as detailed in the story. He made condescending comments, mocked M0shka's work, and was pretentious. However, M0shka's response was to publicly humiliate John in front of his family and friends, which is a significant escalation. Even if John had been an asshole up to that point, publicly roasting him in that context might cross a line.\n\nNow, even though John's actions were irritating and possibly contributed to the conflict, the author's direct response was to attack John's personal life, his career, and future prospects in front of others. Public humiliation is a serious matter, especially in a social setting like a birthday party with family present. It's likely to cause embarrassment and damage relationships, even if the person being humiliated has been a jerk.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author didn't apologize and is now questioning if they were in the wrong suggests there's tension. The response of being kicked out and blocked by John indicates that the author's actions were seen as too much by the group. Even if the group up to that point had accepted John's behavior, the author's choice to confront him publicly in such a harsh way could be seen as the last straw.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author felt provoked over a long period. John's continuous taunts and derogatory nicknames (\"drone,\" \"pussy\") and the fact that he was being mocked for a rejected job application might have led to a build-up of frustration. The author's comment about John's art and future might have been a retaliatory response to ongoing harassment.\n\nHowever, the appropriateness of the response is key here. Even if John was an ass, attacking him publicly in front of his family and friends is likely to be seen as going too far. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because there was a history of conflict, but the specific action of publicly humiliating him could be the main issue. It's a matter of whether the response was proportionate and respectful, given the setting.\n\nIn many social situations, even if someone is a jerk, publicly shaming them can lead to further conflict and is often considered inappropriate, especially when family is involved. The author's comment about John not amounting to anything and his personal life is harsh and could be seen as crossing a line, regardless of prior offenses.\n\nSo, while John's behavior was inconsiderate and contributed to the conflict, the author's public rebuke is the central issue here. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because their actions led to a significant escalation and public humiliation, which is generally not acceptable, even in response to prior provocation."
