We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for publicly criticizing John's art and future in front of his friends and family. \n\nFirst, the context: The author and John are part of a close-knit group. John's behavior has been pretty obnoxious\u2014correcting others condescendingly, making snide remarks, and giving the author a nickname they disliked. John also started a running joke about the author being a \"drone\" and a \"pussy,\" which is pretty harsh. The author was mocked when they apologized for John's job rejection, leading to a confrontation where the author called out John's photography abilities and his situation. This resulted in a physical altercation and social fallout.\n\nNow, the main issue is public humiliation and the appropriateness of the author's response. Even if John was an asshole, responding in a group setting with his family and friends present seems extreme. The author took the mic during a planned activity (the birthday party) to deliver a harsh critique, which could be seen as using the moment for personal retaliation rather than a genuine apology or resolution. Publicly saying someone's art is bad and they won't amount to much is pretty cutting, especially when the person already felt they were being attacked. \n\nThe author might have felt wronged and wanted to defend themselves, but the method of response\u2014during a birthday party where they were supposed to share positive memories\u2014might have crossed a line. Even if John's behavior was toxic, the author's approach could have been more constructive. The fact that John's dad physically reacted suggests the insult was taken very personally and publicly. \n\nOn the other hand, John's behavior was inconsiderate and possibly toxic. The author might have been on edge from previous interactions. However, the key question is whether the author's actions were justified. Publicly belittling someone, regardless of their past behavior, can be seen as inconsiderate and disrespectful, especially if it leads to conflict and social alienation.\n\nSo, while John wasn't perfect, the author's public insult and the way they responded might have made the situation worse. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the public nature of the insult and the escalation it caused. The author could have handled it privately or with more tact to avoid the fallout.\n"
