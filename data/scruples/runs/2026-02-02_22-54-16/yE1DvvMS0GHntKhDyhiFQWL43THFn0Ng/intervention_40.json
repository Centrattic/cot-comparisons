We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about someone, let's call him M0shka, who has been in a group with a new friend John. John has been rude and pretentious, and there's been a lot of back-and-forth teasing and insults between them. M0shka finally snaps at a party, publicly criticizes John's art and life choices, leading to a confrontation where he gets kicked out.\n\nSo, the main question is whether M0shka is at fault here. On one hand, John has been acting obnoxious and has a history of being mean. M0shka tried to apologize, but John was confrontational. The final straw was when John made a derogatory comment in front of others, which led to M0shka's outburst. \n\nBut the key issue is whether M0shka's response was justified. Publicly shaming someone, even if they've been a jerk, can be seen as crossing a line. It's one thing to stand up for yourself in private, but doing it in front of family and friends might escalate the situation more than necessary. Also, the specific words used\u2014calling John a failure, mooching off his parents, and predicting he won't amount to anything\u2014could be harsh and disrespectful, even if the feelings were provoked.\n\nM0shka's actions led to immediate conflict, physical confrontation, and the breakdown of the group. While John's behavior was definitely inconsiderate and rude, the way M0shka responded might have been an overreaction. There's a difference between defending oneself and attacking someone in a public, humiliating way. The social norms usually frown upon public shaming, regardless of the provocation. So, even if John deserved it, M0shka's approach might have been inappropriate. \n\nOn the other hand, the user's original thought is that the author isn't in the wrong. But the question is about whether they are. The user is leaning towards B, but the analysis here suggests that while the provocation was there, the method of response could be considered wrong. So, maybe the answer is A. The author is in the wrong for the way they handled it, even if the situation was escalating. Publicly humiliating someone, regardless of the reason, is typically seen as inappropriate. The correct answer might be A.\n"
