She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves tracking the wife's phone location without her knowledge. The author's reasoning is that he was worried when she didn't show up on time and thought it was a way to check on her safety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. Tracking someone's location without their consent is a privacy issue. Even if the intention was to check on her safety, the method used was invasive. The wife got a notification about her phone being located, which led to her finding out. She felt that this was a breach of trust and privacy, and it's causing conflict in their relationship.\n\nThe author argues that he was worried and had no other option. But is that a valid reason to invade her privacy? Trust in a relationship is crucial, and actions that undermine that trust can be problematic. Even with good intentions, the act of tracking without permission can be seen as disrespectful. The wife's reaction is understandable because she expected trust, not surveillance.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have realized the implications of his actions. He mentioned he had used the feature before without issues, so maybe he didn't think she'd notice. But the outcome shows that it did affect her negatively. The main issue here is the lack of communication. If he was concerned, he could have talked to her or asked where she was instead of using the tracking feature.\n\nIn relationships, privacy and trust go hand in hand. Assuming that tracking is necessary without discussing it first can lead to breaches of trust. The wife's feeling of being untrusting is valid because the action itself, regardless of intent, can be perceived as controlling or not respecting her autonomy.\n\nSo, considering all these points, even though the author's intention was to ensure her safety, the method he chose was invasive without her knowledge. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because respecting a partner's privacy is important, and there should be a mutual understanding about such matters.\n"
