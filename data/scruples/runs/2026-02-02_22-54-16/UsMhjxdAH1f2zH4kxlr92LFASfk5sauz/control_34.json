She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who tracked their wife's location via her phone is in the wrong. The situation is that the wife went out with a friend, didn't answer calls, and the husband used Android's Find My Device feature to check her location out of concern. The wife found out and is upset, feeling he doesn't trust her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The husband had a legitimate reason for concern when she didn't respond and her car wasn't home. He tried calling multiple times, sent texts, and eventually used tracking. The main issue is the invasion of privacy versus his concern for her safety.\n\nOn one hand, tracking someone's location without their knowledge is a privacy breach. Even if the intent is good, it's about consent. Trust is crucial in relationships, and actions like this can erode it. The wife felt mistrusted, which is a valid emotional response. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband was genuinely worried, especially since she didn't answer and they had to get up early. He might have felt it was a necessary step to ensure her safety in a big city. However, using tracking without her knowledge is a line that's crossed, regardless of intent. \n\nLegal aspects aside (since laws vary, but generally, tracking without consent can be a grey area), the ethical aspect is clear. Privacy is a mutual expectation in relationships. Even if the husband thought it was a one-time thing and she wouldn't find out, the fact remains that he accessed her personal information without permission. \n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. If he was worried, maybe he should have approached her in the morning or discussed his concerns instead of tracking her. The wife's reaction is understandable because sudden privacy invasions can lead to trust issues.\n\nIn summary, while his concern for her safety is valid, the method he used was a violation of her privacy. The right approach would have been to communicate his worries and perhaps check in differently. So, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
