She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for tracking his wife's location. The story is about tracking his wife's phone after she didn't show up when expected. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband used the Android Find My Device feature to check her location because he was worried when she didn't come home on time. He had a prior agreement about her returning by 8 PM, but she came back later. He tried calling her, but she didn't answer. After some time, he used the location tracking. She found out and is upset. Now the question is whether he was wrong.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are important. Tracking someone's phone without their knowledge can be seen as a violation of privacy. Even if the intention was to ensure safety, doing it without consent might be problematic. The husband didn't communicate his actions, which could lead to mistrust. However, the wife didn't inform him about her delay, which might have caused his worry.\n\nBut the act of tracking itself, especially if it's a one-time thing done out of concern, might be viewed differently. However, the main issue here is the lack of trust. The husband didn't trust her to be safe and communicate her whereabouts, leading to a breach of privacy. On the other hand, the wife didn't respond to his calls or messages, which could be a point of contention too.\n\nIn many cases, using location tracking without permission is considered an invasion of privacy, even if the motive is good. The husband should have discussed his concerns instead of taking it upon himself to track her. The wife's reaction indicates that she felt her privacy was violated. \n\nSo, even though his intentions were to ensure her safety, the method was a violation of trust and privacy. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
