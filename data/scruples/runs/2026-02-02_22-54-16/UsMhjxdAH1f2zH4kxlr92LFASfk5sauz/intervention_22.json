She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who tracked their wife's location via her phone is in the wrong. The scenario is that the wife went out with a friend, didn't answer calls, and the husband, worried, used the \"Find My Device\" feature to check her location. She found out and is upset, feeling that he didn't trust her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The husband had a valid reason for concern\u2014his wife was supposed to be home by 8 but came back at midnight. He tried calling her but got no response. He waited until 11 PM before using the tracking feature. He mentions he was worried, especially since they live in a big city and she's a strong woman, but still, the anxiety of not knowing her whereabouts might have driven his actions.\n\nNow, the issue is privacy. Tracking someone's phone without their knowledge is a breach of privacy. Even with good intentions, it's an invasion of personal space. The wife felt that her privacy was violated, leading to her anger. Trust is a big component in relationships, and actions like this can erode that trust. The husband's justification is concern for her safety, but there are other ways to handle that, like contacting the friend or the police if she was truly missing. \n\nHowever, the husband did use the tracking feature for a reason. He wasn't just doing it out of spite or suspicion; he was worried. He also didn't confront her directly but used a method he thought wouldn't be noticed. The problem is that using tracking without consent is a red flag. Even if it's for safety, it's still unauthorized. The husband might argue it was out of love and concern, but the wife's reaction shows she felt disrespected.\n\nAnother angle is whether there were other steps he could have taken. For example, contacting the friend she was with, checking in with them, or using other means. If he waited until 11 PM without any response, maybe he should have considered that she might just be late, especially if she's an adult and capable of handling herself. But in a big city, safety is a legitimate concern.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the husband might be at fault for not discussing tracking options beforehand. Maybe he should have had an open conversation about how to handle emergencies instead of acting unilaterally. The wife's anger is justified because her privacy was invaded without her consent. Even if he had her best interests at heart, the method was problematic.\n\nSo, considering all factors, even though the intent was good, the action of tracking without consent is a violation of privacy. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong. But there's a nuance here. If there was a prior agreement that he could track her in emergencies, it might be different. But since there's no mention of that, it's a breach. Hence, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
