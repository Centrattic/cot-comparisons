She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who tracked their wife's phone is in the wrong. The situation is that the wife went out with a friend, didn't answer the husband's calls, and he used Android Find to track her location because he was worried. She found out and is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband was worried because she didn't come home on time, especially since they had to wake up early. He tried calling her multiple times without response, which is understandable to be concerned. But then he used her phone's location tracking feature. \n\nNow, the key issue here is consent. Even if his intentions were good, tracking someone's phone without their knowledge is a breach of privacy. Most people would agree that privacy is important in relationships, and using such features without permission can feel like a violation. Even if he thought he was being responsible, the act of tracking without consent is problematic. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of trust. The wife feels that she wasn't trusted, which is a big deal in a relationship. The husband admitted he didn't think she'd find out, which shows he might not have considered her feelings or their agreed boundaries. \n\nBut the husband's concern for her safety is valid. He was worried she might be in danger. However, the right approach would have been to communicate, maybe contact her friend to check on her, or reach out to her in other ways rather than using tracking. \n\nSo, while his intentions were out of worry, the action itself was a privacy violation. Therefore, he's in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
