She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about tracking his wife's location via her phone because he was worried when she didn't come home as expected.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband tried calling and texting his wife but didn't get a response. He was worried because she's usually home by 8 PM but it's 10 PM and she's not there. He used the Android find feature to check her location. The problem is that he did this without her knowledge or consent, which is a privacy issue.\n\nOn one hand, his intention was concern for her safety, which is understandable. He mentions not trusting her, but that's part of the issue. Trust is important in a relationship, and invading someone's privacy, even with good intentions, can be a breach of that trust.\n\nOn the other hand, he didn't communicate his actions or his worries. If he was that concerned, maybe he should have talked to her after she came home instead of tracking her. Also, using the find feature without her knowledge is a violation of her privacy, regardless of the reason. Even if he thought it was necessary, it's a gray area because he should have discussed tracking her with her beforehand.\n\nThe wife being upset is a natural reaction. She might feel that he didn't trust her, which could lead to more issues in their relationship. The key point here is consent. If he had her permission to track her, maybe it's different, but he didn't. So, the answer would likely be that he's in the wrong (A) because of the privacy violation and lack of communication, even though his intentions were good.\n"
