She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author did something wrong by tracking his wife's location. Let me start by going through the situation again.\n\nThe author says his wife went out for dinner with a female friend and told him she'd be back by 8 PM. He called her when he finished work early, but she didn't pick up. He went home, noticed her car wasn't there, and tried calling again. He waited until 10 PM, sent a text, still no response. By 11 PM, he's worried because it's a big city and anything could happen. He uses his Android Find My Device to locate her phone. It turned out to be a familiar place, so he thought she was safe. But she found out and is upset. She came home at 12:30 and was grumpy because he tracked her.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The wife was out past the time she said she'd be home, and the husband was worried. But did he communicate his worry properly? He tried calling and texting, but maybe he should have considered other reasons she wasn't answering. Maybe she was in a different area with no signal, or just busy. But he didn't know that. \n\nUsing tracking without her knowledge is a privacy issue. Even if his intention was to check on her safety, it's a breach of trust. She might have felt violated that he accessed her phone's location without permission. Trust is important in a relationship, and this action could have undermined that. He thought she wouldn't find out because he didn't get a notification when people tracked him, but maybe that's because he wasn't set up to receive them. \n\nHe also mentions that they both have to get up early and usually go to bed by 10 PM. She came home at 12:30, which disrupted her sleep. He might have been more worried about her safety than her privacy in that moment. However, the method he used to check on her could have been a mistake. \n\nThe question is whether his action was wrong. Privacy is a big deal. Even with good intentions, tracking someone without their consent is generally seen as a violation of their privacy. The wife's reaction is understandable because she felt that her autonomy was invaded. The husband should have, perhaps, called her more or waited a bit longer before using the tracking. Maybe there's a better way to handle such situations, like discussing boundaries beforehand. \n\nBut on the other hand, the husband was genuinely worried about her safety, which is a valid concern. In a big city, things can go wrong. However, the approach he took might not have been the best. It's possible that he could have communicated his concerns to her later, instead of acting on them without her knowledge. \n\nSo, considering both sides: the husband had a valid reason for concern, but his method of addressing it was a breach of privacy. Therefore, he's in the wrong because he didn't respect her privacy, even if his intentions were good.\n"
