She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who tracked their wife's phone is in the wrong. The situation is that the wife went out with a friend and didn't answer her phone when the husband called. He got worried, didn't get a response, and used the Android Find My Device feature to check her location. She found out and is upset, feeling he didn't trust her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy. Using someone's phone without their consent is a clear privacy violation. Even if the husband had good intentions, accessing her phone without asking is a breach of trust. The wife might feel that her autonomy is being respected, and this action undermines that. The fact that she's upset about being tracked shows that it's a big deal for her.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband was worried because she didn't respond and her car wasn't home. He tried calling, messaging, and then used the tracking app. He might have thought he was doing the right thing out of concern for her safety. But the problem is that he didn't communicate his intentions or check with her first. Trust in a relationship is built on mutual respect and communication. Tracking someone without their knowledge can lead to bigger issues than the initial concern.\n\nAlso, the wife's reaction is important. She's upset not just about the tracking but about the lack of trust. The husband's action might have been a momentary solution to his worry but caused more harm by invading her privacy. There could be other ways to address his concern, like talking to her about setting up a better communication plan for when they're out.\n\nSo even though his intent was to check on her safety, the method he used without her consent is problematic. The right approach would have been to talk to her about his worries instead of using tracking. Therefore, he's in the wrong for violating her privacy without discussing it first.\n"
