She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for tracking his wife's location via her phone. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: The wife went out to dinner with a friend, said she'd be back by 8 PM, but didn't answer calls when the husband got home. He found her car wasn't there, tried again later, and when she still didn't respond, he used Android's Find My Device feature to locate her. She came home late, was grumpy, and is upset about the tracking. The author feels he was worried and didn't see another option.\n\nThe question is whether this is an asshole move or just a mistake. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know what I think.\n\nLet's consider the key points here. The husband's actions were driven by concern. He was worried because she didn't answer his calls, her car wasn't home, and she hadn't responded to his messages. In a big city, there are risks, so his anxiety is understandable. He used a tracking feature that he believed wouldn't alert her, but she found out and is upset.\n\nNow, the ethical angle: Privacy vs. safety. The wife might feel that her privacy was invaded. Even if he had good intentions, accessing her phone's location without her knowledge is a breach of trust. On the other hand, he was trying to ensure her safety, which is a valid concern. The problem is that he didn't communicate his intentions first or ask for her permission. If there was a previous agreement about using tracking features, that might change things, but from the story, it seems like there wasn't.\n\nAnother aspect is the wife's reaction. She's upset about not being trusted, and the author acknowledges that. The fact that she found out about the tracking through an alert suggests that the feature might have some kind of notification, which the author didn't know about. But even so, using tracking without consent is generally a privacy issue.\n\nIn many relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner feels they need to track the other's location without consent, it can lead to feelings of mistrust and violation. The husband might have believed he was acting in her best interest, but the method of doing so without her knowledge is problematic. There might be alternative steps he could have taken, like contacting her friend or the restaurant, instead of using tracking. \n\nHowever, the husband's actions were out of concern, which is a mitigating factor. But intention doesn't absolve the action. Even if done with good intentions, violating someone's privacy is still a wrong action. The key here is the lack of communication. If he had discussed his concerns with her first, maybe they could have found a solution together.\n\nSo, considering all these points, while the husband's intentions were to ensure her safety, the method he used without her consent breaches her privacy. Therefore, he is in the wrong because tracking someone's location without their knowledge is generally considered an invasion of privacy, regardless of the reason.\n"
