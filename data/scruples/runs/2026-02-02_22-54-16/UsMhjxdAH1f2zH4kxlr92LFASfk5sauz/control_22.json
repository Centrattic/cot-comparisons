She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for tracking his wife's phone. \n\nFirst, the context: The wife went out with a friend, said she'd be back by 8, but didn't answer calls. The husband got worried, especially since she didn't reply to a message about paperwork. He used Android's Find My Device to check her location and found her at a familiar place. However, she found out and is upset because he didn't trust her.\n\nSo, the key points here are privacy, trust, and communication. Tracking someone's phone without their knowledge is a big privacy issue. Even if the husband was worried, using a tracking feature without her consent violates her privacy. Trust in a relationship is built on mutual respect, and this action might have broken that trust. The wife felt untrusted, which is a valid reaction. \n\nEven though his intentions were to check on her safety, the method was intrusive. He should have communicated his concerns instead of secretly tracking her. There might have been other ways to handle the situation, like contacting her friends or calling the police if she didn't answer. \n\nSo, while his intentions might be understandable, the action itself is a breach of privacy. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
