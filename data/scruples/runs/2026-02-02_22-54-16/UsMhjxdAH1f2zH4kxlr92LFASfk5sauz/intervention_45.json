She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for tracking their wife's location via her phone. Let me break down the situation. The wife went out for dinner with a friend, said she'd be back by 8 PM, but the husband ended up home earlier because their dinner finished early. He didn't hear from her, called, then texts, but she didn't respond. He got worried and used the Android Find My Device feature, which is on her phone. She found out because her phone sent a notification, and now she's mad. The husband is wondering if he's an asshole or just being stupid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Tracking someone's location without their consent is a privacy issue. Even if his intention was out of concern, the act itself is a violation of privacy. The wife might feel that he didn't trust her, especially since she's a strong woman and the situation wasn't an emergency. The husband didn't ask for her permission to track her, so that's a problem. But he was worried because she didn't come home or respond, and it was late. He might have thought it was the only option, but there are other ways to handle it, like contacting her friends or calling the police if necessary.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but the question is whether others would see it that way. The key points here are consent and trust. Even if the husband had good intentions, tracking her without consent is a breach. The wife's reaction is about being blamed for lack of sleep and feeling untrusted. In many relationships, trust is crucial, and this might have made her feel violated. So, while he was worried, the method he used without her knowledge is likely the issue. The answer probably leans towards A (he is in the wrong) because it's about respecting privacy and trust, even if the motive was good. However, some might argue it's B (not in the wrong) due to concern for her safety. But in terms of right or wrong, the act of tracking without consent is generally considered wrong.\n"
