She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who tracked his wife's location via her phone is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband was worried because his wife didn't come home on time and didn't answer his calls. He used a tracking feature to find her, thinking it was necessary because he was concerned about her safety in a big city. However, he didn't get her permission before doing this. \n\nFrom a privacy perspective, even if his intentions were good, using someone's phone without their consent is a breach of trust. People generally expect their privacy to be respected, especially in personal relationships. The wife was upset because she felt her privacy was invaded, which makes sense. \n\nBut there's also the angle of his concern for her safety. He was worried and couldn't reach her, so he took action. However, there might have been other ways to handle the situation, like waiting a bit longer, calling others she was with, or just trusting her. \n\nThe key points here are consent and the violation of trust. Even if the action was driven by worry, the method was intrusive. The wife didn't agree to being tracked, so regardless of intent, it's a breach of her privacy. \n\nIn many relationships, trust is crucial. If he had discussed his concerns with her beforehand or had an agreement about tracking, it might be different. But since he acted without her knowledge, it's likely seen as wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because he violated his wife's privacy without her consent, even if his intentions were to ensure her safety.\n"
