She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for tracking his wife's location. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the wife went out to dinner with a friend. She told him she'd be back by 8 pm. He called her, she didn't answer. He went home, noticed her car wasn't there. Then she didn't respond to texts or calls. He got worried and used Android's Find My Device feature to check her location. She found out and is upset. The author says he was worried and didn't think she'd notice, but she got a notification and is mad now.\n\nNow, the main issue here is privacy. The author accessed his wife's phone's location without her consent. Even if it was out of concern, tracking someone's location without their knowledge can be seen as a violation of trust. The wife is upset because she feels he didn't trust her. Even though the intention was to check on her safety, the method might be problematic because it's an invasion of privacy.\n\nIn relationships, trust is important. If one partner feels that their privacy is being invaded without a prior agreement, they might feel violated. The author didn't discuss this tracking beforehand, so it's a breach of boundaries. Even if he had good intentions, the act itself is a no-go in many relationships. \n\nAlso, the author mentioned that he didn't think she'd notice, but he did receive a notification when someone tracked his phone. So maybe there's a misunderstanding about how the feature works. It's possible that he shouldn't have used the feature in the first place, regardless of the situation.\n\nAnother angle is that the wife came home late without informing him, which added to the tension. But that doesn't justify tracking her. The key here is the lack of communication and consent. The author acted out of worry, but the right approach would have been to talk to her first or maybe confront her about being late instead of tracking her phone.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the author's intentions were good, the action of tracking his wife's phone without her knowledge is a violation of her privacy. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
