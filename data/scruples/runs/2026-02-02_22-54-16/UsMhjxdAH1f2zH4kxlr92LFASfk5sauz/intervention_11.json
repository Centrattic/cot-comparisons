She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for tracking their wife's location via her phone. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The husband tracked his wife's location because she didn't answer her phone when he got home early. He was worried, especially since she didn't come home until midnight. He used Android's Find My Device feature through his own account, thinking she wouldn't notice. But she did, and she's upset because she feels he didn't trust her.\n\nHmm, the key points here are consent and trust. Even though he had a concern about her safety, tracking someone without their knowledge is a privacy issue. In a healthy relationship, partners should discuss such matters upfront. The husband didn't ask her if it was okay to track her phone. Even if he was worried, there might be other ways to handle it, like calling again, checking with her friend, or confronting her about why she wasn't answering. \n\nThe wife's reaction is important too. She's grumpy because she didn't get enough sleep and feels blamed. This suggests that the tracking might have added to her stress. Also, she mentioned she read his message about the paperwork but didn't respond, which could mean she was busy or chose not to reply. The husband's assumption that something was wrong might be based on incomplete information.\n\nNow, considering the broader context: Privacy is a big deal. Even if the intent was good (safety), the method was invasive. There's a difference between worrying and respecting boundaries. The husband didn't communicate his concerns, which could have led to a conversation about safety measures. Instead, he acted unilaterally, which undermines trust. \n\nSo, while his intentions might be understandable, the action itself is problematic. The right approach would have been to talk to her about his worries or maybe agree on a way to check in without violating privacy. Since he didn't do that, it's a breach of trust, even if he had good intentions. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
