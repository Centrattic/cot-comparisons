She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user is asking if it's their fault for tracking their wife's phone location without her knowledge.\n\nFirst, the context: The wife went out to dinner with a female friend and said she'd be back by 8 PM. The husband called her but she didn't pick up. He went home, but her car wasn't there. He tried calling again, but no answer. He got worried, especially since they had to get up early. Eventually, he used the Android Find My Device feature to check her location because he was worried about her safety in a big city. However, she found out and is upset. She came home late and is angry because she feels he didn't trust her.\n\nNow, the key points here are about trust and privacy. The husband's intention was to check on his wife's safety because she didn't answer the phone and didn't come home as expected. He thought he was being responsible, but he did it without her knowledge or consent, which is the main issue. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. Even if the husband's intentions were good, tracking her phone without her consent can be seen as a breach of privacy. People generally expect a certain level of privacy in their personal devices. Even if it was out of concern, doing it without discussing it first might undermine the trust in the relationship. \n\nThe wife's reaction is understandable because she wasn't told about this capability. If she had known, maybe she would have set boundaries or discussed it. Also, the fact that she was out with a friend and didn't respond could be due to various reasons, not necessarily something dangerous. The husband's assumption that he needed to track her might have been based on fear rather than actual evidence of a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband wasn't trying to spy on her or be malicious; he was worried. But the method he used is problematic. There's a difference between being concerned and respecting someone's privacy. The right approach might have been to talk to her, express his concerns, or maybe ask for her location through direct communication instead of using tracking features without her knowledge.\n\nIn terms of legal or rights aspects, depending on the jurisdiction, tracking someone's phone without their consent could be a violation of privacy laws. But in the context of a relationship, it's more about mutual respect and trust. \n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the husband had good intentions, using the tracking feature without her consent is a breach of trust and privacy. Therefore, he might be in the wrong from the perspective of respecting her autonomy and privacy, even if his motives were to ensure her safety.\n"
