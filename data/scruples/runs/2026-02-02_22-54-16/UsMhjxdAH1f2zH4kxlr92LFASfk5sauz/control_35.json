She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who tracked their wife's location is in the wrong. The situation is that the wife went out with a friend, didn't answer the phone, and the husband, worried, used her phone's location tracking feature. She found out and is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband's intention was out of concern for her safety. He tried calling and messaging but got no response. He used a feature that he thought wouldn't alert her. However, she did find out and is now upset about the invasion of privacy.\n\nOn one hand, his concern is understandable. It's natural to be worried if a loved one doesn't come home on time, especially in a big city. He tried multiple times to reach her before using the tracking feature, which shows he wasn't just jumping to conclusions.\n\nOn the other hand, tracking someone's location without their consent is a violation of privacy. Even with good intentions, it's an act that crosses a boundary. Privacy is important in relationships, and trust is key. By tracking her, he may have undermined that trust, even if his motives were good.\n\nThe wife's reaction is also a factor. She's upset because she feels her privacy was invaded. The husband didn't communicate his concerns or ask for her permission. Even if he thought there was no notice, the fact that she received a notification shows the method wasn't as stealthy as he believed.\n\nThere's a balance between concern and respecting boundaries. The husband could have taken other steps, like contacting her friends or local authorities if she didn't show up. Tracking her phone might have been an impulsive decision without considering her feelings.\n\nIn many relationships, trust and open communication are crucial. Instead of tracking, discussing his worries with her beforehand might have been better. Now that she's upset, he needs to address the breach of trust, not just the action itself.\n\nSo, while his intentions were good, the action was a mistake. The husband is in the wrong because he violated her privacy without consent, even if it was out of concern.\n"
