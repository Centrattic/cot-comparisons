She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author tracked his wife's phone location because she didn't answer his calls and came home late. He was worried, especially since he had asked her to help with some paperwork. He tried calling her multiple times, but she didn't respond. When she didn't come home by 10 PM and he still hadn't heard from her, he got nervous. He used a tracking feature on her phone, possibly through Android's Find My Device, which he had tried before without her knowing. However, she found out and is upset, feeling that he didn't trust her. The author is asking if he was in the wrong, either as an asshole or just being stupid.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key factors here. The main issue is the invasion of privacy. Even though the author had good intentions (he was worried about his wife's safety), using tracking without her consent is a privacy violation. Trust is a big part of any relationship, and doing something secretive like this can damage that trust. The wife is upset because she feels her privacy was invaded, and the author admits he thought she wouldn't find out. That suggests he didn't consider her feelings or her right to privacy. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was genuinely concerned for her safety, especially in a big city. He had reason to be worried when she didn't respond and came home late. However, there might have been other ways to handle the situation. Maybe he could have waited a bit longer, called again, or tried to reach out through other means. Instead of using the tracking feature, which is a private and non-consensual action, he could have discussed his concerns with her when she did come home, explaining his worry without the need to monitor her.\n\nAnother angle is the fact that the wife was grumpy because of lack of sleep and blamed him, which might indicate she felt disrespected. The fact that the author didn't consider that his action might cause her emotional distress is a point against him. Even if his intentions were good, the method was problematic.\n\nIn many relationships, trust and communication are key. The author's action, while coming from a place of concern, may have been a breach of trust. The wife's reaction is understandable because she didn't consent to being tracked. Even if she was just out with a friend, the act of tracking without her knowledge is a violation of her autonomy. \n\nI should also think about whether there's a cultural or societal expectation here. In some cultures, tracking a spouse's location might be more accepted, but generally, in relationships where trust is important, such actions can be seen as controlling or distrustful. The author's assumption that he could track her without her knowledge implies a lack of respect for her boundaries.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author had a valid concern but handled it in a way that invaded his wife's privacy. He didn't consider her feelings or her right to privacy, which is a significant issue. Even if he was worried, there are other ways to address that worry without crossing into privacy violations. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he acted without consent, which is a breach of trust and respect.\n"
