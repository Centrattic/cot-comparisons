She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for tracking his wife's location via her phone. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the wife went out for dinner with a female friend, said she'd be back by 8pm. The husband calls her, she doesn't pick up. He goes home, notices her car isn't there, calls again, no response. Then he texts. By 10pm, she hasn't returned, and he's worried. Since they have to get up early, he tries calling again. At 11pm, he uses a tracking app on her phone (Android Find) to locate her. She found out and is upset. He says he was worried, especially because she didn't respond to his messages, and he needed to know she was safe. But she felt he didn't trust her and was mad about the invasion of privacy.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the husband overstepped by tracking her without her consent. On one hand, he was worried and had valid concerns\u2014she didn't show up when she said, didn't answer calls, and they had to get up early. On the other hand, using her phone's tracking feature without her knowledge is a privacy violation. Even though his intention was to check her safety, the method he used lacked transparency and consent. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. The wife might feel that his action undermines her trust in her. Even if he thought he was being responsible, the lack of communication and the use of a tracking tool without her knowledge could be seen as a breach of privacy. She might have felt that if he had just asked her outright where she was, it would have been better. Instead, he used a method that she didn't agree to, which made her feel untrusted and disrespected.\n\nHowever, the husband's concern for her safety is understandable. She didn't respond, which in a big city could lead to worry. But perhaps there were other ways to handle it, like contacting friends or checking with her directly once she returned. The key point is that using tracking without her consent is a privacy issue, regardless of the motivation. So, even if his intentions were good, the action itself was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he violated her privacy without her knowledge or agreement.\n"
