She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who tracked their wife's location via her phone is in the wrong. So first, I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nThe husband says his wife told him she'd be back by 8 PM, but he got home earlier and found her car wasn't there. He tried calling, no answer. Then he waited until 10 PM, sent a message, no response. The next step was checking her phone's location through Android Find. He found her in a familiar place, but she got mad because she received a notice about being tracked. She's upset about a lack of trust.\n\nSo, the key points here are: he was worried, tried to reach her, and used a tracking feature he thought she wouldn't notice. She felt disrespected because her privacy was invaded. Now, the question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nI remember that in relationships, privacy and trust are crucial. Even if his intentions were good, tracking someone's phone without their consent is generally considered an invasion of privacy. It's a breach of trust because he didn't ask for her permission. Even if he was worried, there are other ways to address his concerns, like being more communicative or setting clear expectations beforehand.\n\nAlso, the fact that she didn't know he was tracking her adds to the issue. She might have felt it was a violation of her personal space. Even though he was concerned, the method he used was inappropriate. People have the right to their location privacy unless there's a legal or explicit agreement otherwise.\n\nHe mentioned he used his account, but tracking someone's phone without their knowledge typically violates their privacy, regardless of the method. So even if he thought he wouldn't get caught, the act itself is problematic.\n\nIn many cases, such actions can lead to trust issues in the relationship. The wife's reaction is understandable because she feels her autonomy was disrespected. So, the husband's actions, while coming from a place of worry, are ethically wrong because they breach her privacy without consent.\n"
