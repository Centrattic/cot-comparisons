She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who tracked their wife's location without her knowledge is in the wrong. The situation is presented in a detailed scenario, so I need to analyze the context carefully.\n\nFirst, the husband tracked his wife's phone because she didn't answer her calls and he got worried. He mentions that she was supposed to come back by 8 PM but her car wasn't there. He tried calling multiple times without success, then used Android's Find My Device feature. He was genuinely worried about her safety, especially because she's in a big city. However, he didn't inform her beforehand, and she found out through the notification, leading to her being upset. She felt he didn't trust her, and he's questioning if he was wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: tracking without consent, breach of privacy, trust issues. Even though his intention was to check on her safety, the method he used was without her knowledge. Privacy is a big factor in relationships. While concern for her safety is valid, the way he handled it could be seen as violating her privacy. There's a balance between concern and respecting boundaries.\n\nIn many relationships, tracking someone's phone without their consent is considered a privacy violation. Even if his intentions were good, the action itself could be seen as an asshole move because it's about respecting each other's space. The wife felt he didn't trust her, which adds to the tension. He should have perhaps asked her directly or considered other ways to ensure her safety without tracking. So, the answer is likely A (he's in the wrong) because the action, while motivated by concern, crossed a privacy boundary without consent.\n"
