She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who tracked their wife's location via her phone is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband used the Android Find My Device feature to track his wife after she didn't come home when expected and didn't respond to calls. He was worried because she was out late, and they had a big day the next morning. He thought he wouldn't get caught since he didn't get a notification when he used it on his own phone. But she found out and is upset.\n\nSo, the main issue here is consent. Did the wife know that her phone was being tracked? The husband didn't ask her permission, which is a problem. Even if his intentions were good\u2014like being worried about her safety\u2014without her consent, it's an invasion of privacy. \n\nNow, some might argue that he had a reason to be concerned, especially since she didn't respond and was out late. But using tracking without her knowledge crosses a line. Privacy is important in relationships, and trust should be mutual. Even if he thought he was being cautious, the action itself is a breach of trust. \n\nAlso, the aftermath shows that the wife felt untrusted, which is a valid feeling. The husband's actions made her feel like he didn't believe she could handle herself, which could strain their relationship. \n\nIn many places, tracking someone's phone without their consent can also be a legal issue, depending on the circumstances. While this might be a domestic situation, the ethical aspect is clear: respecting each other's privacy is crucial. \n\nSo, even though the husband's motives were to ensure her safety, the method he used was wrong because it violated her privacy without consent. Therefore, the answer is A\u2014yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
