She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for tracking their wife's location via her phone. The situation is that the wife went out for dinner and didn't answer her phone when the husband called. He got worried, especially since they both had to get up early, and used the Android Find My Device feature to check her location. The wife found out and is upset, feeling that her privacy was invaded.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband's intention was concern for his wife's safety. He tried calling her multiple times without success, which is understandable. In a big city, not hearing from someone for hours when they said they'd be home by 8 PM could be worrying. He used the tracking feature because he was nervous, thinking it was the only way to ensure she was safe.\n\nHowever, the key issue here is consent and privacy. Even though the husband had good intentions, accessing his wife's phone location without her knowledge or permission is a privacy violation. The wife didn't give him permission to track her, so regardless of the intention, this action breaches trust. The fact that the tracking app sent a notification to her indicating her phone was being located suggests there's a built-in alert system, which the husband might not have been aware of, but the fact remains that she was not okay with it.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. Even if the husband was worried, the best approach might have been to contact her more persistently or involve someone else, like a friend who was with her. Using tracking without permission, no matter the reason, can be seen as a breach of trust. The wife's reaction is valid because she felt that her privacy was invaded, which can lead to feelings of distrust. So while the husband's motives were good, the method he used was problematic. Therefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
