She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who tracked their wife's location without her knowledge is in the wrong. The scenario is that the wife went out with a friend, didn't answer calls, and the husband, worried, used her phone's location tracking. He found out she was safe, but she got mad because she received a notification.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The husband's intention was concern for his wife's safety. He tried to contact her multiple times, which is reasonable. However, accessing her phone's location without her consent is a privacy issue. Even if it was done with good intentions, privacy is a significant factor in relationships. \n\nThe wife might feel that her trust was violated because she wasn't asked if she needed help and instead was tracked. The husband didn't communicate his actions first, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if he thought it was necessary, using such methods without her permission is a gray area. \n\nIn many cases, people value their privacy in relationships. While the husband's concern is understandable, the method he used might not be the best approach. There might be better ways to handle the situation, like calling more persistently, informing friends, or checking in with her social media. \n\nAlso, the husband assumed that the tracking wouldn't be detected, which shows he might have known it was against her wishes. The fact that she got a notification and was upset indicates that the action was not acceptable to her. \n\nSo, weighing the concern for safety against the breach of privacy, the husband probably is in the wrong because he violated her privacy without consent, even if his intentions were good. The correct answer would be A.\n"
