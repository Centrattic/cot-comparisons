She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for tracking his wife's location. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the wife went out for dinner with a female friend and said she'd be back by 8 PM. The husband called her, but she didn't answer. He went home, noticed her car wasn't there, called again, no answer. Then he went to bed at 10 PM, but she didn't come back. He tried texting her about some paperwork she hadn't responded to. By 11 PM, he was getting worried and used the Android Find My Device feature to locate her phone. He found her at a familiar place, so he thought she was okay. But she found out and is upset because he didn't trust her.\n\nThe author argues that he was genuinely worried and didn't think she'd find out. He mentions that he used his account and didn't receive any notifications when his phone was tracked, so he assumed it was safe. The wife is upset because of the lack of trust and the late hour, leading to her being grumpy.\n\nNow, I need to consider privacy and trust issues here. Tracking someone's phone without their knowledge is a big privacy violation. Even if the husband had good intentions, using a tracking feature without consent is a breach of trust. The wife had a right to privacy, and the husband's actions, even if motivated by concern, undermined that. However, the husband was worried because she didn't respond to calls and came home late unexpectedly. The key point is whether the tracking was justified given the circumstances.\n\nOn one hand, the husband had a legitimate concern about his wife's safety. On the other hand, tracking her phone without her knowledge is a significant invasion of privacy. There might be alternative ways to address his worry, like calling again, contacting her friend, or waiting longer. Using a tracking feature without consent could be seen as overstepping, regardless of the intent.\n\nAlso, the wife's reaction is understandable. Feeling that her partner doesn't trust her can cause hurt feelings, even if the situation was out of concern. The husband's assumption that she wouldn't find out is problematic because privacy tools should be used with consent. The fact that she got a notification and was upset shows that the method was not discreet and violated her trust.\n\nSo, while the husband's intentions were probably to ensure her safety, the method he used was a privacy violation. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not respecting her privacy and trust. The answer could be A, but I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. Maybe if he had discussed it with her after, but since he did it without her knowledge, it's a breach. So, I think the answer is A.\n"
