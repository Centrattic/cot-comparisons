She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who tracked their wife's phone without her knowledge was wrong. The situation involves privacy and trust in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the husband tracked his wife's location because he was worried when she didn't answer his calls and didn't come home on time. He mentions they usually go to bed early and she's supposed to help with paperwork. He used the Android Find My Device feature, which is part of her account, but he probably accessed it through his phone or another device. The wife found out and is upset about the lack of trust.\n\nNow, in relationships, trust is crucial. Even if the husband had good intentions, accessing her phone's location without her consent is a breach of privacy. While he was worried, he didn't consider that she might have a valid reason for not answering or being late. Instead of tracking, he could have tried other communication methods or waited a bit longer. The key issue here is the lack of transparency and prior agreement. If they had discussed using such features in case of emergencies, maybe it would be different, but since he acted without her knowledge, it's a violation of her privacy. The wife's reaction is about feeling untrusted, which is a common concern in relationships. So, even though his intentions were to ensure her safety, the method he used without her consent makes him in the wrong.\n"
