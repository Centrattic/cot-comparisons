She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who tracked their wife's location via her phone is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the context: The wife went out with a friend, said she'd be back by 8 PM. The husband called her but she didn't answer. When he got home, her car wasn't there. He tried reaching her again, no response. He waited, did some stuff, then used the Android Find My Device feature to check her location. She found out and got mad. He was worried because she wasn't responding and had to get up early, so he thought tracking was the only option.\n\nSo, the main issue here is privacy. Even with good intentions, tracking someone's phone without their knowledge is a privacy violation. Both partners should have mutual trust. The husband's actions, while coming from a place of concern, overstepped boundaries. The wife's reaction is understandable because she values her privacy and felt her trust was betrayed. \n\nAlso, he mentioned he didn't think she'd notice, but he should have known better. Even if he was worried, there are other ways to handle the situation, like contacting the friend she was with. Using tracking without consent is a breach of trust. \n\nIn relationships, privacy and trust are crucial. While his concern is valid, the method he chose was wrong. The answer here is that he's in the wrong.\n"
