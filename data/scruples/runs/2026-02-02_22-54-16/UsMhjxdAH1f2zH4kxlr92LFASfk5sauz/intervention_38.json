She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for tracking their wife's location. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user's wife went out for dinner with a female friend and said she'd be back by 8 PM. The user called her when he got home earlier than expected, but she didn't answer. Her car wasn't there, so he got worried. After waiting until 11 PM with no response, he used the Android Find My Device feature to check her location. He found she was in a familiar place, which made him feel better. But his wife found out and is upset, feeling he didn't trust her.\n\nNow, the question is: is the author in the wrong? So, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, he was worried and tried to make contact, but when that failed, he used a tracking feature. On the other, tracking someone's phone without their knowledge is a privacy issue. Even if his intentions were good, did he overstep? \n\nIn many relationships, trust is key. If the wife didn't know he had access to her location, that could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if he was worried, using the tracking feature without her consent might be considered a violation of her privacy. His wife was upset because he didn't trust her, which is a valid feeling. She might feel that instead of respecting her autonomy, he resorted to tracking her.\n\nHowever, the user's intent was concern for her safety in a big city. He tried calling and texting first, which makes sense. The tracking was his last resort when all communication failed. He didn't know she'd get a notification, which implies he might not have been aware of the tracking's implications. But still, using someone's phone features without their knowledge is a gray area. \n\nIn some contexts, sharing a location is a mutual agreement or something discussed in the relationship. If the user had previously discussed this with his wife and she had consented, maybe it's different. But since he did it without her knowledge, it's a problem. Privacy is important, and even with good intentions, the act of tracking without consent can be seen as wrong. \n\nSo, while the user's actions were driven by concern, the method he used\u2014tracking her phone without her knowledge\u2014could be considered a breach of her privacy. The wife's reaction is understandable because it's about feeling respected and trusted. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her privacy, even if his intentions were good. So the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
