She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who tracked their wife's location is in the wrong. The situation is that the wife went out with a friend, didn't answer calls, and the husband, worried, used her phone's location tracking. The wife was upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband had a legitimate reason for concern\u2014his wife didn't come home when expected, didn't respond to calls, and it's a big city. But using location tracking without her knowledge is a privacy issue. Even if his intentions were good, the action might be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nNow, relationships often involve boundaries. Trust is crucial. Even if he was worried, not discussing the need for tracking beforehand could be problematic. She might feel disrespected that he didn't communicate his fears instead of taking action. On the other hand, he didn't take any physical action to find her, just used the location to check she was safe. \n\nAlso, the wife was upset about the lack of trust. That's a significant emotional aspect. Even if the husband thought he was being responsible, the method might not be appropriate. There's a difference between being concerned and respecting someone's autonomy. \n\nIn some contexts, tracking someone without their consent is a violation of privacy, regardless of intent. So even if the husband's motives were to ensure safety, the act itself is questionable. The wife's reaction is valid because her privacy was invaded. \n\nHowever, the husband might argue that he was in a state of worry and saw tracking as the only way to ensure her safety. But there's a better approach\u2014maybe he could have had an open conversation about his fears before resorting to tracking. Maybe he should have called the friend or waited longer. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband's action, while stemming from concern, crossed a privacy boundary. Therefore, he is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
