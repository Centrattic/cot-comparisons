She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about tracking his wife's phone without her knowledge. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the wife went out to dinner with a female friend and said she'd be back by 8 PM. The husband called her when he was coming home early, but she didn't answer. He went home, noticed her car wasn't there, tried calling again, but nothing. He did some chores, watched TV. By 10 PM, he texts her about some paperwork. Still no response. By 11 PM, he gets worried and uses the Android Find My Device feature to track her phone. He saw it was at a familiar place and thought she was okay. However, she got a notification that her phone was being located and is now mad at him. She came home at 12:30 AM and is upset about the lack of sleep and feels he didn't trust her.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nI need to consider privacy and trust in a relationship. Tracking someone's phone without their knowledge is a breach of privacy, even if done out of concern. While the husband had a reason to be worried (she was late, didn't respond), the method he used was invasive. There might be other ways to address his concern, like contacting her friends or authorities if it became a real emergency. However, using the tracking feature without her consent, even if it was on his own account, is a privacy issue. The fact that she was notified and felt betrayed suggests that this action hurt the trust between them. Even if he was worried, respecting her autonomy and privacy is important. The wife's reaction is valid because she felt her privacy was invaded and her trust was broken. So, the husband's action, while coming from a place of concern, was a mistake because it violated her privacy without her consent. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
