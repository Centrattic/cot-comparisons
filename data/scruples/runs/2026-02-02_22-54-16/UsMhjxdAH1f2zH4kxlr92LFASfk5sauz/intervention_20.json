She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who tracked their wife's phone location is in the wrong. The situation is that the wife went out with a friend, didn't answer her phone, and the husband got worried and used the Android Find feature to track her. Now she's upset because he didn't trust her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband was worried because his wife didn't come home on time and didn't respond to calls. He tried to locate her because he was concerned for her safety. But tracking someone's phone without their knowledge is a privacy issue. Even if done with good intentions, it's a violation of trust and privacy. \n\nIn many relationships, transparency is important. If the husband had discussed tracking with his wife beforehand and she had agreed, maybe it's different. But since he did it without her consent, that's where the problem lies. The wife felt her privacy was invaded, which is a valid reaction. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of mutual trust. The husband's actions might come off as controlling, even if he was worried. The wife's grumpiness the next day shows the emotional impact of this breach. \n\nBut the husband's intention was concern for her safety. However, intentions don't mitigate the action's consequences. The key issue here is the lack of consent. Even if it was out of worry, tracking someone's location without their knowledge is a breach of trust. \n\nSo, considering all that, the husband might be in the wrong because of the privacy violation, even though his intent was to ensure her safety. The answer would likely be A, yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
