She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for tracking his wife's location via her phone. The key points from the story are: the wife went out with a female friend, didn't answer calls or texts, and the husband, worried because she wasn't home by 10 PM, used the Android Find My Device feature. He found her location, but she found out and is upset. She came home late and is grumpy, blaming him for not trusting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband's main reason was concern for his wife's safety. He mentions she's a strong woman but in a big city where anything could happen. He tried calling, texting, but got no response. Then he used the tracking feature, which he thought she wouldn't notice. The problem is that he violated her privacy, even if with good intentions.\n\nNow, the question is whether this makes him the asshole. On one hand, tracking someone's phone without their knowledge is a privacy issue. Trust is a big part of relationships, and this action might be seen as a breach of trust, even if done out of worry. On the other hand, the husband was genuinely concerned, especially since his wife didn't return as expected and hadn't responded. He didn't have any other immediate way to check on her safety.\n\nBut in relationships, consent and open communication are important. If he had discussed his concerns with her beforehand, maybe she would have understood. Instead, doing it without her knowledge, even if with good intentions, might be seen as overstepping. The wife's reaction is understandable because she feels her privacy was invaded. She might also feel that his action implies distrust in her ability to handle herself, which can be hurtful.\n\nAnother angle: the husband used the tracking feature without her consent. Even if he thought it was necessary, the act itself is a violation of her privacy. Privacy is a fundamental right, and without explicit permission, tracking someone's location can be considered wrong. The husband's justification is concern, but that doesn't necessarily override the privacy aspect.\n\nHowever, the husband's intent wasn't malicious. He wasn't trying to spy on her but was worried. The outcome was that she found out and felt mistrusted. The key here is whether the action was justified given the circumstances. Since she didn't respond to calls and texts, and he had no other way to check, maybe he felt he had no choice. But perhaps there were other ways to handle it, like calling her work or the friend she was with. \n\nIn some cases, people might argue that the husband's actions were a reasonable expression of concern. Others might say that trust should be assumed unless there's a specific reason not to. Since the wife has a history of being reliable, the husband's action might be seen as unnecessary. \n\nConsidering all this, the consensus in AITA threads often leans towards respecting privacy unless there's a clear and present danger. Since the wife was with a friend and there's no indication of actual danger, the husband's action might be seen as overstepping, even if done out of concern. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong because he didn't respect her privacy without a compelling reason, leading to a breach of trust.\n"
