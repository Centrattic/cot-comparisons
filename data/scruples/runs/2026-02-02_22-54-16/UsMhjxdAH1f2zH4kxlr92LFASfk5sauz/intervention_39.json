She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves tracking his wife's location via her phone because she didn't come home as expected. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The wife went out with a female friend, said she'd be back by 8pm, but didn't return. The husband tried calling, got no response, and eventually used her phone's location tracking through Android Find. He found her at a familiar place, but she found out and is upset. She came home late, was grumpy, and blames him for not trusting her.\n\nNow, considering the husband's actions. He was worried because she didn't show up, didn't answer calls, and there was an important task that needed her attention. His motivation was concern for her safety. But tracking her phone without her consent is a privacy issue. Even if his intent was good, the method might be problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, he thought she wouldn't know because he used his account, which he had tried before without alerts. That shows he might not have realized the app could notify her. But the fact remains that he accessed her location without her permission. \n\nTrust in a relationship is important. The wife felt he didn't trust her, which is a valid reaction. Even if he was worried, the act of tracking her could be seen as a breach of privacy. However, he had a genuine concern for her safety. But maybe there were other steps he could have taken first, like contacting her friend to check on her, instead of using the tracking feature.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The intent was to protect, but the method invaded her privacy. Depending on cultural or personal views on privacy, some might say yes, he was wrong. Others might understand his worry. But generally, tracking someone without consent, even out of concern, is a violation of their privacy. Therefore, the answer would be A: Yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
