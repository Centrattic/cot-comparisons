She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who tracked their wife's location via her phone is in the wrong. The situation is that the wife went out for dinner with a friend, didn't answer her phone, and the husband, after getting worried, used the Android Find My Device feature to check her location. The wife found out and is upset, feeling that her privacy was invaded.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, tracking someone's phone without their consent is a privacy violation, even if the intent is to check on their safety. Legally, spouses don't have automatic rights to access each other's private information unless they have shared accounts or given permission. So, using the Find My Device feature without the wife's knowledge might be a breach of trust and privacy.\n\nEthically, trust is a cornerstone of a relationship. The husband's actions, even if well-intentioned, could be seen as a breach of that trust. The wife felt that her privacy was invaded, which is a valid feeling. Even though he was worried, the method he used to check on her was not transparent. Open communication would have been a better approach. Instead of secretly tracking her, he could have reached out more insistently or maybe even gone to her location to check on her, which might be a more respectful approach.\n\nAnother angle is the husband's assumption that using the feature wouldn't be noticed. This shows a lack of understanding of how such features work. The Android Find My Device might not always send notifications, but there's a possibility it could, which he didn't account for. However, even if it didn't, the act itself is still a privacy issue.\n\nThe wife's reaction is understandable. She was out with a friend, which is normal, and the husband's tracking might have made her feel like she wasn't trusted. The fact that she was grumpy the next day and blamed him for not trusting her indicates that the action hurt her emotionally. The husband's justification of being worried doesn't negate the violation of privacy; intentions don't always excuse the action in relationships, especially when trust is involved.\n\nHowever, there's a counterpoint: the husband was genuinely worried. The context is that they live in a big city, and things can happen. Maybe he felt that checking her location was the only way to ensure her safety. But the key here is that he should have had an open conversation about it first. If he was worried, he could have asked her to share her location temporarily, which most phones allow with the other person's consent. That way, she would have agreed to it, and there wouldn't be a privacy issue.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband's action was a breach of privacy and trust, even if his intentions were good. The correct answer would be that he is in the wrong (A) because he didn't have consent to track her phone, and the method used undermined the trust in the relationship.\n"
