She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for tracking their wife's location via her phone. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The husband tracked his wife's location using her phone after she didn't come home on time and didn't answer his calls. He was worried because she didn't show up when expected, and they had an early morning. He used a tracking feature, which he thought wouldn't be noticed, but she found out and is upset. Now he's asking if he's an asshole for doing that.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, he was worried about her safety. If she didn't come home and there were no responses, someone might reasonably get concerned. On the other hand, tracking someone's phone without their knowledge is a privacy issue. Even if the intention was good, it's a violation of trust and privacy. \n\nThe wife's reaction is understandable. Even if she was just late, being tracked without consent can feel like a betrayal. Trust in a relationship is built on mutual respect, and this action might have undermined that. The husband didn't communicate his concerns directly; instead, he took a private action that could be seen as controlling or not respecting her boundaries.\n\nAlso, the husband mentions that he used a feature he thought wouldn't notify her. That shows he was aware there might be a privacy aspect but proceeded anyway, thinking he wouldn't get caught. That's a key point because it suggests he knew there was a risk but took it, which is a sign of poor judgment.\n\nIn many relationships, transparency is important. If there were legitimate safety concerns, the better approach would have been to talk about it beforehand and perhaps set up an emergency plan rather than secretly tracking her. The fact that he did it without discussing it shows a lack of communication and consideration for her autonomy.\n\nSo, even though his intentions were worried and protective, the action itself is problematic. The wrong lies in the violation of privacy rather than the concern itself. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
