She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (who's tracking his wife's phone) is in the wrong. The options are A for yes and B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband tracked his wife's location because she didn't answer his calls or texts, and he was worried. She later got mad because she found out he did that. He argues it was out of concern, but she felt it was a breach of trust.\n\nSo, the key points here are: intention (he was worried), the method (using Android Find), and the aftermath (she's upset). From a legal standpoint, if both phones are on the same account or he had access, maybe there's some gray area. But ethically, tracking someone without their consent is usually considered a privacy violation. Even if done with good intentions, it's about respecting boundaries. \n\nThe wife had agreed to be home by 8, didn't respond when he called earlier, and he waited until 10:30 before tracking. Even if he was worried, the fact that he used tracking without her knowledge is a problem. Trust is important in relationships, and this action might have undermined that. So even if the motive was concern, the action itself is likely seen as wrong because it's a privacy issue. \n\nSo the answer is probably A. The husband is in the wrong because he violated her privacy, even with good intentions. The wife's reaction is valid because she didn't consent to being tracked. The husband should have communicated his worry differently, maybe by confronting her when she got home or discussing tracking access beforehand.\n"
