She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for tracking his wife's phone location. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband tracked his wife's phone because he was worried when she didn't respond to his calls and was late. He used the Android Find My Device feature without her knowledge. The wife found out and is upset, feeling that her privacy was invaded.\n\nSo, the main issue here is privacy versus concern. The husband's intention was to check on her safety because he was worried. However, the method he used was without her consent. Even if his intentions were good, accessing someone's location without their knowledge can be seen as a breach of trust and privacy. \n\nIn relationships, mutual trust is crucial. While the husband had a legitimate reason to be concerned, the act of secretly tracking her location without discussing it first might be viewed as overstepping boundaries. The wife's reaction is valid because she might feel that her autonomy was respected by not having to account for every move, especially if she's an adult and capable of managing her own safety.\n\nThe husband might argue that he was just being careful, but the fact that he didn't communicate his fears and instead took matters into his own hands could be problematic. There's a balance between concern and respecting personal space. The wife's anger stems from both the invasion of privacy and the implication that she isn't trusted.\n\nAdditionally, the husband should have considered other ways to handle the situation. For example, he could have waited a bit longer, left more messages, or called her friend to check on her. Using tracking without consent might be seen as a violation, regardless of the reason. \n\nIn many relationships, such actions can lead to bigger trust issues. Even if the outcome was positive (her being safe), the means used were questionable. The wife's right to privacy is important, and the husband's actions, while well-meaning, did not respect that. \n\nTherefore, even though the husband's intentions were to ensure her safety, the method lacked transparency and respect for her autonomy. The answer is likely that he is in the wrong.\n"
