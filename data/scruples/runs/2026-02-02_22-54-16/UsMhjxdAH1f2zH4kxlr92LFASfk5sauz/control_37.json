She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for tracking his wife's location without her knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband was worried because his wife didn't return home when she said she would, and she didn't answer her calls. He used a feature on his phone to track her location, which he thought she wouldn't notice. However, she found out and is upset because he didn't trust her. \n\nOn one hand, the husband had a legitimate reason to be concerned. His wife didn't come home on time, and he couldn't reach her. He used the tracking feature out of worry for her safety. That seems like a reasonable reaction if he thought something might be wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, tracking someone's location without their consent is a privacy issue. Even if the intention was good, it's a breach of trust. The wife felt that her privacy was invaded, and she's upset about not being trusted. In relationships, mutual trust is important. Using a tracking method without discussing it first could be seen as overstepping, regardless of the reason.\n\nI should also think about whether there were other options. Maybe he could have contacted her through other means, like messaging her friend, or waited a bit longer before taking action. But he might not have considered those options under the stress of the situation.\n\nThe key points here are consent and trust. Even with good intentions, acting without consent can damage a relationship. The husband's actions, while coming from a place of concern, might have been a mistake because they undermined his wife's trust in him. So, the answer might be that he is in the wrong because of the breach of privacy, despite his intentions.\n"
