She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves tracking his wife's phone location without her knowledge because he became worried when she didn't respond to his calls and messages.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The husband used a tracking feature on her Android phone, which he had set up. He accessed her location because he was worried after she didn't come home by 8 PM as she had promised. He was concerned about her safety in a big city and couldn't reach her. He thought she wouldn't know he was tracking her, but she found out and is upset. She returned home late, was grumpy, and blamed him for not trusting her. Now he's asking if he was wrong (AITA) or just stupid (TIFU).\n\nSo, the main ethical question is about privacy and trust in a relationship. Tracking someone's phone without their consent is generally a violation of their privacy, even if done with good intentions. The husband had access to her phone's location, perhaps through shared devices or accounts, but using it without her knowledge crosses a line. While his concern for her safety is understandable, the method he used undermines trust. Privacy is a crucial aspect of any relationship, and actions that breach that trust, even out of concern, can cause significant harm. The wife's reaction is valid as she felt her privacy was invaded, and the lack of communication about such tracking is a problem. Even if he had good intentions, the means were inappropriate. The husband should have discussed his concerns with her instead of taking unilateral action. Therefore, the answer would be that he is in the wrong (A).\n"
