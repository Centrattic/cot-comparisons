She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the husband tracked his wife's location using her phone without her knowledge. He was worried when she didn't come home on time and tried to contact her multiple times without success. He mentions that he used the Android Find feature, which he had tried before without her knowing, but she found out this time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy. Even if the husband had good intentions, tracking someone's location without their consent is a privacy violation. Most people value their privacy, especially in relationships. The wife was upset because he didn't trust her, which is a valid reaction. Trust is important in a relationship, and this action might have broken that trust.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he was worried. He tried to contact her, but she didn't respond. However, there are other steps he could have taken, like contacting her friend or using other means to check on her well-being without tracking her phone. Using the tracking feature, even if it was to find her location, is a breach of her privacy regardless of intent.\n\nAlso, the fact that he thought she wouldn't find out suggests he knew it was something she wouldn't agree to. Now that she's mad, the issue isn't just the act itself but also the lack of communication. He should have discussed his concerns with her instead of making a unilateral decision. Even if his actions were out of concern, the method was inappropriate.\n\nSo, while the husband's intentions were to ensure her safety, the means he used without consent is a significant problem. Privacy violations are generally considered wrong, and in a relationship, trust and open communication are key. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
