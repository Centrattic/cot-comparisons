She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about tracking his wife's phone location because she was late coming home. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the husband called her when he got home early, but she didn't answer. Then he checked her phone's location through the Android Find My Device feature. He found out she was somewhere, but she got a notification and is upset. Now he's worried if he was in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and privacy. The wife didn't know he was tracking her phone. Even though he was worried, using a tracking feature without her knowledge might be a breach of her privacy. Many people might see that as invasive, regardless of his intentions. \n\nAlso, he mentioned that he didn't think she would find out because he hadn't received notifications when his phone was tracked. But just because he didn't experience it doesn't mean it's okay to do to someone else. Trust is important in relationships, and actions like this can undermine it. \n\nShe came home late and was already stressed, and now he's tracking her without her knowledge. She's upset because she feels he doesn't trust her. Even if he was worried, there are other ways to handle the situation, like calling more frequently or checking in, but not using a tracking feature without her consent.\n\nIn most cases, privacy is a big deal. People might argue that the husband's actions were a breach of trust, making him the asshole. However, some might say he was just worried and didn't have a bad intent. But the main issue here is the lack of consent. \n\nI think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. Tracking someone's location without their knowledge is a privacy violation, even if done out of concern. The wife's reaction is understandable because her privacy was invaded.\n"
