She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for tracking their wife's location via her phone. I need to decide between A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, the situation: The husband tracked his wife's location using her phone after she didn't answer his calls and he got worried. He used the Android Find My Device feature. She found out and is upset. The key points here are consent and privacy. \n\nDid the husband have the wife's permission to track her phone? The story says he thought she wouldn't find out because he didn't receive a notice when he used it on his own phone. But she did get a notification, which led to her being upset. Without explicit consent, tracking someone's phone is a privacy violation, even if the motive is concern. \n\nThe husband was worried because she didn't come home and didn't respond. But there are other ways to handle it, like checking with mutual friends or contacting her workplace. Using the tracking app without her knowledge is a breach of trust. The wife feels disrespected and that her privacy was invaded. \n\nEven if the husband had good intentions, the act of secretly tracking someone is problematic. Privacy is important in relationships, and respecting boundaries is key. The wife's being upset is a valid reaction. So the husband's actions are wrong because they were done without consent, regardless of the reason. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
