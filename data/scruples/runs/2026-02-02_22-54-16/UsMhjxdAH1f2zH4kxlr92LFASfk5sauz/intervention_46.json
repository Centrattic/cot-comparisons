She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who tracked their wife's phone is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband tracking her location after she didn't respond to calls and was late. He was worried, especially since they had to get up early, and he felt he had no other option.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband had a legitimate concern because his wife didn't show up as expected and wasn't answering. He tried multiple times to contact her, and when that failed, he used the tracking feature. But tracking someone's location without their consent is typically a privacy issue. Even if the intent was to check on her safety, the method might be questionable. \n\nIn many relationships, trust is a big part. If the wife didn't know about the tracking, then the husband violated her privacy. Even if he was worried, the fact that he didn't ask and just did it could be seen as a breach of trust. The wife's reaction shows she felt disrespected, which is a valid response. \n\nBut on the other hand, the husband was genuinely concerned. He didn't have other means to find her and thought it was a way to ensure her safety. The problem is that without prior agreement or her knowledge, using tracking can be seen as an overreach. \n\nI should also think about the fact that he didn't inform her about the tracking feature before. Maybe if they had a discussion about emergencies, this wouldn't be an issue. But since he did it without her knowledge, it's a privacy violation. \n\nSo, even though the intention was good, the action itself was a breach of privacy. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the lack of consent and the resulting breach of trust. However, the situation is complex because of the concern for safety. But in terms of right or wrong, the key factor is the unauthorized tracking, which is usually considered wrong regardless of intent.\n"
