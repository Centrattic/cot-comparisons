She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the husband tracked his wife's location via her phone because he got worried when she didn't answer his calls and came home late. The wife found out and is upset. The possible answers are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no, he's not). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The husband had a reason to be worried\u2014he tried to reach her multiple times with no response, and she was late. He used a tracking feature, which he thought she wouldn't notice. But the key issue here is privacy. Even if his intentions were good (concern for her safety), tracking someone without their consent can be a breach of trust.\n\nThe wife was upset because she felt mistrusted. Trust and communication are crucial in relationships. Even if he was worried, the right approach might have been to talk to her about his concerns rather than secretly tracking her. The fact that he didn't ask for permission and used a method that she found out about suggests that he overstepped personal boundaries. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of how he handled the situation. Instead of contacting her more persistently or maybe informing others, he resorted to tracking. It might have been a split-second decision out of anxiety, but it's still a privacy violation. The wife's reaction is valid because it's about respecting each other's autonomy and privacy.\n\nOn the other hand, one could argue that he was just trying to ensure her safety. But respecting privacy is a two-way street. The husband's actions, regardless of intent, led to a breach of trust. So even if he was worried, the method he used was inappropriate. The answer here is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
