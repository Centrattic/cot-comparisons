She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for tracking his wife's location via her phone without her knowledge. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points of the situation. The husband tracked his wife's location after she didn't return home by the expected time and didn't answer his calls. He mentions that he was worried because she was out late in a big city. He used a feature on her Android phone (Find My Device) through his account, assuming she wouldn't notice. However, she did find out and was upset about the lack of trust.\n\nNow, the main ethical issues here are privacy and trust. Even if the husband had good intentions (like being concerned for her safety), tracking someone's phone without their consent is a violation of their privacy. The wife felt that her trust was broken, which is a significant factor in relationships. The husband's actions, though driven by worry, were done without her knowledge or permission. \n\nIn many relationships, transparency and communication are crucial. If the husband was genuinely worried, he could have addressed his concerns directly with her once she arrived home. Using technology to track her without her knowledge sets a problematic precedent. It's possible that the wife values her privacy highly, and this action could lead to lasting resentment.\n\nAlso, the husband's assumption that she wouldn't find out shows a lack of awareness. The fact that the tracking feature sent a notification to her indicates that the system is designed to alert users when their location is accessed, which the husband didn't consider. This might be seen as negligence on his part, as he didn't check if the action would notify her.\n\nMoreover, the wife was upset about being blamed for not getting enough sleep, which adds to the tension. The husband's actions might have been well-intentioned, but the method he used was invasive. Relationships often require mutual respect, and respecting each other's boundaries is essential. \n\nIt's also worth noting that the husband could have handled the situation differently. For example, contacting her friends to check on her safety or waiting a bit longer before taking such drastic measures. Tracking her location without her consent, even in a moment of worry, crosses a line that many would consider a breach of trust.\n\nIn conclusion, while the husband's intentions were rooted in concern, the method he used was a breach of privacy and trust. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
