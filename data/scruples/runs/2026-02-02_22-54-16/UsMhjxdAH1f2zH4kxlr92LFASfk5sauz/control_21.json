She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the husband tracked his wife's location via her phone because he got worried when she didn't come home on time. He thought she might be in trouble since it's a big city and they have to get up early. But she found out and is upset because she feels he didn't trust her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the husband had a genuine concern for his wife's safety. He tried calling and texting her, and when she didn't respond, he used the tracking feature. That seems like a natural reaction if you're worried about someone's safety. But on the other hand, tracking someone's phone without their consent is a privacy issue. Even if the intention was good, it's a violation of personal boundaries. \n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The husband didn't ask for permission to track her, which is a big no-no. Trust is a fundamental part of a relationship, and if she felt that he didn't trust her, that could cause more issues. Also, the fact that she found out about it through an app notification shows that maybe she wasn't aware of this feature, so he didn't even discuss it with her beforehand. \n\nBut then again, he wasn't malicious. He was worried and thought it was the only option. However, there are other ways to handle such situations. Maybe he could have called the friend she was with to check on her, instead of using the tracking feature. That might have been a better approach without invading her privacy.\n\nIn many relationships, mutual respect for privacy is important. Even though he had good intentions, the method he used was invasive. The wife's reaction about not being trusted is valid because tracking someone's location can be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nSo, putting it all together, while his concern was understandable, the action of tracking without consent crosses a line. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
