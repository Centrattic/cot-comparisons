She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for tracking their wife's location. The story goes that the wife went out to dinner with a friend and didn't respond to calls. The husband got worried, used the Android 'Find My Device' feature to check her location, which he found out later she discovered, and she's upset. The user thinks the husband isn't in the wrong, but wants an opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband was worried when his wife didn't answer her phone and her car wasn't home. He tried multiple ways to contact her, and when he got concerned, he used a tracking feature. But tracking someone's location without their consent can be a privacy issue. Even if he had good intentions, the act of tracking without permission might be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The husband didn't ask for her permission before tracking her. Even though he was worried, the method he used could be viewed as invasive. In a trusting relationship, open communication is essential. Instead of tracking her, he might have waited a bit longer or considered other ways to reach out. Also, he mentioned that he didn't think she'd find out, which might indicate a lack of awareness about the implications of his actions.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband had a legitimate reason for concern\u2014his wife was out past the usual time, didn't respond, and they had important tasks to do the next day. His actions were driven by worry rather than malicious intent. However, privacy is a big factor here. Using a tracking feature without her knowledge, even with good intentions, can be seen as violating her privacy.\n\nSo, the question is whether the means (tracking) justified the ends (his worry). In relationships, trust and respect for each other's boundaries are crucial. Even if the husband was worried, tracking her without consent might have been a mistake. The wife's upset reaction is understandable because it's a privacy invasion. Therefore, the husband might be in the wrong for not respecting her privacy, even if his intentions were good. But there's also the argument that he acted out of concern, so it's a gray area. But given the emphasis on consent and privacy, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong).\n"
