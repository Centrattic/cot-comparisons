She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The situation is that the author tracked his wife's phone location when she didn't come home on time. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the wife went out for dinner with a friend and said she'd be back by 8 PM. The husband called her when he got home early, but she didn't pick up. Her car wasn't there, so he worried. He sent a text about some paperwork, which she read but didn't respond to. Then, when she didn't come home by 10 PM, he used the Android Find My Device feature to track her phone. He found her at a familiar place and thought she was safe. But she got a notification about the tracking and was upset. She came home late and blamed him for not trusting her.\n\nNow, the main issue here is whether using the tracking feature was wrong. Let's consider privacy vs. concern. The husband was worried, which is understandable, especially in a big city. However, tracking someone's phone without their knowledge is a privacy invasion. Even if the intention was good, the action was without consent. The wife might feel that her privacy was breached, leading to a lack of trust. Trust in a relationship is crucial, and actions like this can damage that, even if done out of concern.\n\nThe husband might argue that his intent was to ensure her safety, but the method used was problematic. There could have been other ways to check in, like waiting a bit longer or asking mutual friends. Also, the wife might have felt that her autonomy was respected if she had been asked first. The fact that the feature sent a notification shows that the system is meant to alert users when someone else tracks them, reinforcing that it's a breach of privacy.\n\nSo, while the husband's intentions were good, the action itself was a violation of privacy. The answer would likely be that he's in the wrong (A) because the method used, despite good intentions, was not consensual and undermined trust. Even if the situation was concerning, there are more respectful ways to handle it.\n"
