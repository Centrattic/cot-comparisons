She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for tracking his wife's phone location. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that his wife went out with a female friend and told him she'd be back by 8 PM. He tried calling her but she didn't pick up. He went home, noticed her car wasn't there, and tried contacting her again with no response. As time passed and she didn't come home by 10 PM, he got worried. He used the Android Find My Device feature to locate her. She found out and is upset, feeling he didn't trust her. The author is torn between his concern and her reaction.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Trust in relationships is a big factor. Even though he had genuine concerns, using tracking without her consent could be seen as a breach of privacy. While he was worried, there might have been other ways to handle it, like continuing to call or messaging, or maybe checking with mutual friends. The key points here are consent and communication. Tracking someone's phone without their knowledge typically infringes on their privacy, regardless of the reason. Even if the intention was to ensure her safety, the method used might not be appropriate. The wife felt distrusted, which can harm the relationship. So, even if the action came from a place of concern, the lack of transparency is problematic. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her privacy without a clear reason to do so.\n"
