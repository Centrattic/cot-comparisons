She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for tracking their wife's location. Let me start by breaking down the details.\n\nThe wife went out to dinner with a friend and was supposed to be back by 8 PM. The husband was worried when she didn't answer his call and her car wasn't home. He tried calling again, but she didn't respond. It's 10 PM, and he's still waiting. He texts her about paperwork, but she doesn't reply. By 11 PM, he's really worried and uses the Android Find My Device feature to track her. She comes home later and is upset about it, feeling he doesn't trust her. The husband is now wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. He was worried because she was late and unresponsive. He had a legitimate reason to be concerned, especially since she's in a big city. However, using her phone's location tracking without her consent is a privacy issue. Trust in a relationship is crucial, and this action might have breached that trust.\n\nBut then again, his intention was out of concern. He didn't know she would find out, so he didn't have malicious intent. However, privacy is a big deal. Even if the intent was good, the action itself is a violation of her privacy. There's a difference between being worried and taking steps that invade someone else's privacy without their knowledge or consent.\n\nAnother angle: maybe he should have considered other ways to reach her first. Like leaving a message with her friend or contacting the restaurant. Instead, he resorted to tracking her. That could be seen as overstepping. Even if he's worried, there might be more respectful ways to handle it.\n\nAlso, communication is key. If he was worried, he could have asked her friend if she was okay instead of tracking her. Or maybe discussed the situation with her when she got home, explaining his concerns. Instead, he acted without discussing it first, which led to her being upset.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, trust is two-way. If he's tracking her without her knowing, it might make her feel that he doesn't trust her, even if he has good intentions. The aftermath shows she was grumpy and blamed him for not trusting her. That's a sign that his actions hurt her feelings, which is important to consider.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The husband had a genuine concern, but his method of addressing it (tracking her phone without consent) is a privacy violation. Even if the motive was good, the action itself is problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
