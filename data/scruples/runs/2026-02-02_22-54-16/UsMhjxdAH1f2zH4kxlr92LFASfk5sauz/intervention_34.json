She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for tracking their wife's location via her phone. The situation involves the wife going out with a friend, not replying to calls, and the husband checking her location out of worry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband was worried when his wife didn't show up and didn't answer her phone. He used a feature to find her phone's location because he was genuinely concerned. However, this led to his wife finding out and being upset about the lack of trust.\n\nOn one hand, the husband's action was motivated by concern for her safety, especially since they live in a big city. He thought he wasn't being tracked, which might mean he didn't realize the app would notify her. But on the other hand, tracking someone's phone without their consent is a privacy issue. Even if the intention was good, respecting boundaries is important in a relationship. The wife felt her privacy was invaded, leading to trust issues.\n\nI should also think about the fact that the wife was grumpy and blamed him for not trusting her. This suggests that the husband's action hurt her feelings, even if his intent was to ensure her safety. There might have been alternative ways to handle the situation, like contacting her friend or reaching out to the restaurant. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. The husband's action, while well-meaning, might have undermined that trust. It's possible that he didn't consider how she would feel if she found out. So even if the intention was good, the action itself could be seen as a breach of privacy and trust.\n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because of the privacy violation, despite the concern for her safety.\n"
