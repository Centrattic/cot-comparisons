She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who tracked his wife's location via her phone is in the wrong. The situation involves him using a feature to find her phone because he was worried when she didn't show up home as expected. She found out and is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue here is privacy. The husband used a tracking feature without her consent. Even if his intentions were to check on her safety, doing so without her knowledge could be seen as a violation of trust and privacy. \n\nHe mentions that he was worried when she didn't come home and had tried to contact her. But the method he used\u2014tracking her phone without asking\u2014might be problematic. In a relationship, trust is crucial. If one partner feels the need to track the other without permission, it can lead to feelings of mistrust and disrespect.\n\nOn the other hand, he was genuinely concerned. She didn't respond to calls or texts, which could have valid reasons (like being busy, no signal, etc.), but he didn't know. However, the right approach might have been to communicate his worries and ask if she was okay, rather than using a tracking feature. \n\nThe wife is upset because she feels her privacy was invaded, and he didn't trust her. Even if she was just late, the act of tracking without consent can be hurtful. The husband's justification that he thought she wouldn't find out doesn't mitigate the fact that he acted without her permission.\n\nIn many relationships, partners might have discussions about boundaries and privacy. If he had a legitimate concern, maybe he should have approached her about it instead of secretly tracking. The key here is the lack of communication and consent. \n\nSo, while his intentions were to ensure her safety, the method was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he violated his wife's privacy without her consent, leading to mistrust. The answer should be A.\n"
