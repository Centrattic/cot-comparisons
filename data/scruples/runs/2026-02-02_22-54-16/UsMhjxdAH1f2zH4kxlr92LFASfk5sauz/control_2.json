She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who tracked his wife's location via her phone is in the wrong. The story says he did this because he was worried when she didn't answer her calls and came home late. He used the Android Find feature, which he thought wouldn't notify her, but it did, and she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy issues. Even with good intentions, tracking someone's phone without their consent is a breach of privacy. Trust is a big part of a relationship, and this action might have undermined that trust. He might have thought he was being responsible, but the method he used was invasive. \n\nAlso, there's the fact that he didn't communicate his concerns with her. Instead of checking in directly or expressing his worry, he chose to track her. That could be seen as a lack of trust. Even if he was worried, there might have been other ways to handle it, like waiting a bit longer or talking to her when she got home. \n\nOn the other hand, he was genuinely worried. The wife didn't respond to calls or messages, and it was late. He might have felt it was necessary to ensure her safety. But the problem is that he assumed the right to track her without asking. \n\nThe key points are consent and trust. Even if the action was out of concern, doing it without her knowledge crosses a line. The wife's reaction is understandable because she feels her privacy was invaded. The answer probably leans towards the author being in the wrong (A) because of the privacy violation, even though his intentions were good.\n"
