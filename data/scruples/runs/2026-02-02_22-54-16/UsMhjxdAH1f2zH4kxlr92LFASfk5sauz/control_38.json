She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for tracking his wife's location via her phone. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband was worried when his wife didn't return home on time. He used her phone's tracking feature because he was concerned about her safety in a big city. He thought she wouldn't find out since he didn't get any notifications before. However, she did find out and is upset.\n\nSo, the main issue here is consent and privacy. Even if the husband had good intentions, tracking someone's location without their permission is a violation of their privacy. Trust is a big part of a relationship, and using such methods can erode that trust. The wife felt untrusting, which is a valid reaction. Even though he was worried, there might have been other ways to handle the situation, like contacting her friends or using other communication methods instead of secretly tracking her.\n\nAlso, the fact that he used her phone's tracking feature without her knowledge is a key point. Most people would consider that a breach of privacy, regardless of the reason. The husband might have thought he was doing the right thing out of concern, but the method he used without her consent is problematic. \n\nAnother angle is the aftermath. The wife was upset because of the lack of sleep and felt blamed. The husband's action might have caused unnecessary stress for her. Even if his intentions were good, the outcome was negative. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. Instead of tracking her, he could have asked her again where she was or contacted her friends. His choice to track her without her knowledge might have been impulsive and not the best solution. \n\nSo, putting it all together, while his concern was genuine, the method he used was a violation of her privacy. Therefore, he is likely in the wrong.\n"
