She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for tracking his wife's location. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe husband tracked his wife's phone because she didn't come home when she said she would. He was worried since she didn't answer his calls or texts. He used the Android Find My Device feature, which he thought wouldn't alert her. But she found out and is upset, feeling he doesn't trust her.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The wife went out with a female friend, which isn't unusual. The husband was at a table, which I assume is a regular social place. She mentioned she'd be back by 8 PM, but he got home early and her car wasn't there. He tried calling, but she didn't pick up. After 10 PM, he texts her, but she read it. Then he goes to bed at 10, which they usually do. At 11, he calls her again, which is late for her. He uses the tracking feature because he's worried. She comes home at midnight and is upset.\n\nNow, the key points here are: tracking without her knowledge, the husband's concern versus the invasion of privacy, and the wife's reaction. \n\nTracking someone's phone without their consent is generally considered a privacy violation. Even if done with good intentions, it's a breach of trust. The husband might have been worried, but he should have considered other options first. Maybe he could have contacted her friend to check if she's okay, or asked her directly when she comes home instead of tracking her phone. \n\nHe thought she wouldn't find out, but she did. The wife feels untrusted, which is a valid feeling. The husband's actions, while motivated by concern, crossed a boundary. Even if he had good reasons, the method he used was intrusive. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he was worried, he should have discussed it with her instead of using tracking. It's important to respect each other's privacy. So, yes, the author is in the wrong for using her phone's tracking feature without her knowledge. The answer should be A.\n"
