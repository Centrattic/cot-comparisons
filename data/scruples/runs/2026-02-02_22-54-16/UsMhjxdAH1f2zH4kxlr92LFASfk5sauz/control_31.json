She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for tracking his wife's location via her phone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband was worried when his wife didn't come home on time and didn't answer her phone. He used the \"Find My Device\" feature on her phone. He was genuinely concerned because she came home late, which is unusual, and they had to wake up early. However, he didn't tell her beforehand about using this feature, and she found out later, which made her upset.\n\nNow, from a privacy standpoint, accessing someone's phone without their consent is a breach of trust. Even if the intention was good, like worrying about her safety, the method he used was invasive. The wife felt that her privacy was invaded, which is a valid feeling. Trust in a relationship is important, and doing something like this without discussing it first can damage that trust.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of his concern for her safety. He had a legitimate reason to be worried since she didn't respond and was out later than expected. However, there might have been other ways to handle the situation, like contacting her friends or checking in more directly instead of tracking her phone. The key here is whether there was a better approach that respected her privacy.\n\nThe husband didn't consider that his wife might not want to be tracked, even if it's for safety. Privacy issues can be sensitive, and even though his intentions were good, the action itself was inappropriate. The wife's reaction is understandable because she felt her privacy was violated, leading to her feeling untrusted.\n\nSo, balancing the concern for safety and respecting privacy, the husband did something wrong by not discussing this with his wife beforehand and using a tracking method without her consent. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
