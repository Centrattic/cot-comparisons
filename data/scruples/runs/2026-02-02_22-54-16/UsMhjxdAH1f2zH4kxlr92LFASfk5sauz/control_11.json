She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for tracking their wife's phone location.\n\nFirst, the situation: The husband tracked his wife's phone because she didn't answer his calls and wasn't home by 10 PM. He was worried, called her, no response, then used Android's find my device feature. She found out and is upset, feeling he doesn't trust her. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Well, tracking someone's phone without their consent is a privacy issue. Even if the intention was to check on her safety, it's a breach of trust. The wife might feel that her privacy was invaded, especially if he didn't consider that she might have a reason for not answering. Maybe she was in a situation where she couldn't take calls, like in a meeting or with friends. \n\nThe husband's actions, while coming from concern, could be seen as overstepping. Trust is important in a relationship, and assuming he needed to track her without discussing it first might have been unnecessary. Also, the fact that he didn't think she'd notice the tracking feature shows he might not have considered her feelings in the first place. \n\nHe should have maybe considered other options first, like calling again, texting, or contacting the friend she was with. Using tracking without her knowledge could damage the trust in the relationship. Even if the outcome was good (she was safe), the act itself was a privacy violation. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A, yes, he's in the wrong. The action was a privacy breach regardless of intent. Even if worried, respecting her autonomy and privacy is important. He should have communicated better or found other ways to check on her without tracking.\n"
