She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for tracking his wife's location. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author used his account to track his wife's phone through Android's Find My Device feature. He did this because she didn't answer his calls, her car wasn't home, and he was worried. He mentions that he thought she wouldn't know he did this because he didn't get notifications when his phone was tracked. But she did get a notification, and she's upset about it. She came home late, was grumpy, and blamed him for not trusting her.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want my opinion. The options are A for yes (in the wrong) or B for no (not in the wrong).\n\nSo, let's break it down. From a privacy perspective, tracking someone's phone without their knowledge is a big invasion of privacy. Even if the motive is concern, it's still a breach of trust. The author didn't ask his wife if it was okay to track her, which is a key point. Consent is important in any relationship, and tracking without it can be seen as a violation. \n\nThe wife's reaction is understandable. She might feel that her privacy was invaded, especially if she wasn't aware of the tracking. Even though the author had good intentions, the action itself could be seen as crossing a boundary. The fact that she got a notification and was upset suggests that she values her privacy and felt disrespected.\n\nHowever, the author was worried and felt like he had no other options. He tried calling multiple times and was concerned about her safety. But in a healthy relationship, communication is key. Instead of tracking her, maybe he should have discussed his concerns with her or asked if she was okay. Tracking without her knowledge undermines trust, which is essential in a partnership.\n\nAlso, the fact that he didn't consider her reaction or the implications of his actions shows a lack of consideration. Even if he thought she wouldn't notice, the act of secretly tracking her is a breach of trust. The wife's feeling of being untrusted is valid, as she might feel that her autonomy is being questioned.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern for her safety is genuine. He didn't act out of malice but out of worry. But the method he chose was problematic. There might have been other ways to address his concerns without invading her privacy.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: the author's intentions were good, but the action was a privacy violation. In many relationships, trust and communication are more important than immediate solutions. Therefore, even with good intentions, the action was wrong because it lacked consent and damaged trust.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
