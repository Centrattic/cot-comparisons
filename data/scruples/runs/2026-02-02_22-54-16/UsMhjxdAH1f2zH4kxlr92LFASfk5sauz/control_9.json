She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who tracked his wife's location via her phone is in the wrong. The key points here are consent and privacy. \n\nFirst, the husband used a tracking feature without his wife's knowledge. Even though he had a legitimate concern about her not being home on time and being worried, the act of tracking without her permission is a privacy issue. Trust and communication are crucial in a relationship. By not discussing his concerns and instead using the tracking app, he might have violated her trust. \n\nHe mentions that he didn't think she would find out because he had used it on his own account before. However, the fact that he used her phone's tracking feature without her consent is a problem. People generally expect their privacy to be respected, even if someone's intentions are good. \n\nHis wife came home upset, feeling untrusted and blaming him for her lack of sleep. The husband's actions, while stemming from worry, didn't take into account her feelings and autonomy. Even if he was worried, the right approach would have been to communicate his concerns and check in with her directly, rather than resorting to tracking without her knowledge.\n\nSo, even though there's understandable anxiety, the method he used was a breach of privacy. That makes him at least partially at fault. Therefore, the answer is A (yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
