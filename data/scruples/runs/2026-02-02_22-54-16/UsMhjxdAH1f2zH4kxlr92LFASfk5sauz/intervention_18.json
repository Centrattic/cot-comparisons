She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for tracking his wife's location via her phone. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: The husband tracked his wife's location after she didn't answer his calls and he got worried. He mentions they live in a big city and he's concerned about her safety. He used the Android Find My Device feature, which he had tested before without her knowing. She found out and is upset, feeling that he didn't trust her. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nNow, to analyze this, I need to consider several factors. Privacy is a big one. Even in a marriage, individuals have a right to privacy. Using a tracking feature without her consent might be a breach of that privacy, even if the intention was to ensure her safety. Consent is key here. Did he have her permission to use her phone's location tracking? The story says he never told her he had done it before, so it's likely he didn't have her consent.\n\nAnother angle is the reason for the tracking. He was worried because she was out later than expected. However, there are other ways to check in, like calling again, sending texts, or maybe even contacting the friend. Tracking might have been a quick fix, but it's an invasive one. His wife's reaction about not being trusted is valid because tracking someone's location secretly can feel like a violation of trust, even if the intention was good.\n\nAlso, communication is important in relationships. If he was concerned about her safety, maybe having an open conversation about the situation would have been better. Instead of resorting to tracking, he could have discussed his worries and maybe set some boundaries together.\n\nThere's also the aspect of trust. By tracking her, he might have undermined the trust in their relationship. She felt grumpy the next day because of the lack of sleep and blamed him for not trusting her. That suggests that his actions, while well-intentioned, had negative consequences on their relationship.\n\nHowever, he was genuinely worried, and in a big city, safety is a valid concern. The line between concern and overstepping is thin here. It's possible that he didn't realize how serious tracking someone without consent is, which might make it more of a mistake than an asshole move, but the act itself is problematic.\n\nIn some contexts, people might argue that he's not in the wrong because he was trying to protect her. But from a privacy standpoint, the method he used was inappropriate. There's a difference between being worried and acting on it in a way that invades someone's privacy.\n\nSo, considering all these points: lack of consent, invasion of privacy, undermining trust, and the available alternative actions, it seems like he did cross a line, even if his intentions were good. Therefore, the answer would be that he is in the wrong.\n"
