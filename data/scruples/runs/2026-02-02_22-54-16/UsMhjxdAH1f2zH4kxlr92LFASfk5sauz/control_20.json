She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for tracking his wife's location via her phone. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the husband tracked his wife's location because she didn't answer his calls and he got worried. He mentioned they both had to get up early, and she was supposed to be home by 8 PM. He waited until 11 PM, then used the Android Find My Device feature. The wife found out and is upset because she feels he doesn't trust her.\n\nNow, I need to determine if this is an asshole move or not. The key points here are consent and privacy. Tracking someone's location without their knowledge is a privacy invasion. Even if the husband had good intentions, he didn't ask her if that was okay. Trust is important in a relationship, and this action might undermine that. \n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he was worried, but there are other ways to handle the situation, like contacting her friends or local police if he was really concerned. Using tracking without permission breaches privacy, which is a big deal. The fact that he didn't think she'd find out also suggests he didn't consider the implications of his actions.\n\nOn the other hand, he was worried about her safety, which is understandable. However, respecting her privacy is equally important. The wife's reaction is valid because it feels like a lack of trust. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he had concerns about her safety, discussing it openly instead of tracking her would be better. So, even if his intentions were good, the action itself is problematic without consent. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
