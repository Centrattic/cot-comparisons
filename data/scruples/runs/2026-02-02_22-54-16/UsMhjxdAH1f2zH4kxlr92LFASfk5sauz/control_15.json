She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for tracking his wife's location via her phone.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's wife went out for dinner with a friend and was supposed to be back by 8 PM. He called her but she didn't answer. When he got home, her car wasn't there, and she didn't respond to his calls or texts. He got worried, especially since they both had to wake up early. At around 11 PM, he used the Android Find My Device feature to track her phone. He found her at a familiar location and thought she was safe. However, she found out and was upset because she received a notification about her phone being located. She felt he didn't trust her and was grumpy the next day.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the possible angles.\n\nPrivacy vs. Safety: Tracking someone's phone without their knowledge is a privacy issue. Even if done with good intentions, it's an invasion of privacy. On the other hand, the author was worried about his wife's safety in a big city. He mentions she's a strong woman but anything can happen. The key here is whether the action was justified by the concern for her safety.\n\nTrust in the Relationship: The wife felt that her husband didn't trust her. Even if there was a legitimate reason, the act of tracking without consent can erode trust. The author might have thought it was an emergency, but the wife's reaction shows that she felt her autonomy was violated.\n\nLegal and Ethical Considerations: Legally, tracking someone's phone without their permission might be a gray area. Ethically, it's a breach of privacy. Even if the intent was to ensure her safety, the method used was invasive.\n\nAlternatives: The author could have tried other means first, like asking mutual friends if they knew her whereabouts, or contacting the restaurant where she was supposed to be. Using the tracking feature was a last resort, but it's possible he didn't consider other options.\n\nCommunication: The author didn't communicate his concerns or actions with his wife until after the fact. If he had been more transparent about his worries and discussed his need to track her location, maybe the issue could have been resolved differently.\n\nThe wife's reaction is understandable. She was out with a friend, didn't expect her phone to be tracked, and felt her privacy was invaded. The author's justification of being worried doesn't negate the violation of privacy. While his intentions were good, the action itself was problematic.\n\nIn many relationships, trust is crucial. The wife might have felt that instead of tracking her, he should have trusted her to handle the situation. Even if she was late, she might have had a valid reason that wasn't immediately apparent.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's action was a breach of privacy, even if done out of concern. The wife's right to privacy and autonomy in the relationship is important. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
