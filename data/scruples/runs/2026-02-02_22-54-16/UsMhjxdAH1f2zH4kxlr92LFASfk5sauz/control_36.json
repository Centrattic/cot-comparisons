She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about tracking his wife's location through her phone without her knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband tracked his wife's phone using Android's Find My Device feature after she didn't answer his calls and he was worried. He mentions he was concerned because she was out late, they needed to wake up early, and he had a task that required her help. However, he did this without her consent, which his wife found out and is upset about, feeling he didn't trust her.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the invasion of privacy. Even if his intentions were out of concern, tracking someone without their permission is a breach of trust. Privacy is a big deal in relationships. Even if he had good intentions, the method he used was secretive and could be seen as controlling. The wife's reaction is valid because she feels her privacy was violated. The husband should have discussed his concerns with her instead of taking matters into his own hands. While his worry is understandable, there are better ways to handle it, like asking her for her location directly or expressing his concerns rather than tracking her secretly. \n\nAlso, the fact that he didn't consider that she might be in a safe place or that she might not want to be tracked is a problem. The wife's autonomy is important, and the husband's actions undermine that. Even if the outcome was positive (he found her safe), the action itself is questionable. \n\nIn many cases, using technology to track someone without their consent is considered a breach of privacy, regardless of the reason. So, the author is in the wrong here. The answer should be A.\n"
