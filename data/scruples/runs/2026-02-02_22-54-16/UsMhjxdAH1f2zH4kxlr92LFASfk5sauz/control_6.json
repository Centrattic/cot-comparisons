She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who tracked their wife's location is in the wrong. The scenario is that the wife went out with a friend, didn't answer calls, and the husband, getting worried after she didn't come home on time, used her phone's location tracking. He found her at a familiar place but she found out and is upset because he didn't trust her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The husband's intention was out of concern for his wife's safety. He tried calling and texting but got no response. Since they have to wake up early, he's worried about her being late. He used the location tracking because he thought it was a way to check on her without her knowing, to ensure her safety. But she found out and is upset because she feels he didn't respect her privacy.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, his actions were motivated by worry and a desire to ensure her safety. On the other, tracking someone's location without their consent can be seen as a violation of privacy. Even if his intentions were good, the act itself is a breach of trust. Trust is crucial in a relationship, and secretly tracking someone's location might undermine that trust, even if done with good intentions.\n\nAlso, the wife might feel that her autonomy is being questioned. Even if he was worried, there might have been other ways to approach the situation, like contacting her friend to check in, instead of tracking her phone. The husband's action might come off as controlling, especially if it's not discussed beforehand. The fact that he didn't consider that she might not want to be tracked, or that she might have had a reason for not answering (like being in a situation where she couldn't), is another angle. \n\nBut then again, the husband didn't have any prior incidents where she was in danger, so his action was a reaction to an unusual situation. However, the problem is that he didn't communicate his concerns to her before taking such steps. The wife's reaction shows that the action hurt her feelings and made her feel untrusted. \n\nIn relationships, privacy is important. While safety concerns are valid, the method used here might not be the best approach. There's a balance between concern and respect for each other's privacy. The husband might have overstepped by not discussing the possibility of tracking in advance or seeking a mutual agreement on how to handle such situations. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, even though his intentions were good, the action itself was a breach of privacy without consent. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
