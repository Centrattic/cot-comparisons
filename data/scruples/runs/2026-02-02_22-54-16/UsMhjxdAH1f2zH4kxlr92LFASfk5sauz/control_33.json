She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about tracking his wife's phone location without her knowledge. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the husband tracked his wife's phone because he was worried when she didn't show up on time. He used Android's Find My Device feature. She found out and was upset. The user is asking if he's the asshole (AITA) or if it was a mistake.\n\nHmm. The key points here are trust and consent. Even though he had a legitimate concern, tracking someone's phone without their knowledge or permission is a big privacy invasion. Trust is a cornerstone in relationships, and this action could be seen as a breach of that trust. He might have had good intentions\u2014checking her safety\u2014but the method was wrong. There are other ways he could have handled it, like contacting her friends or authorities if she was missing for too long. Also, he mentioned that he thought she wouldn't know, which shows he didn't consider her privacy. His wife felt mistrusted, which is a valid reaction. So even if his intent was to protect, the action undermines trust. Therefore, the answer is likely A, he's in the wrong.\n"
