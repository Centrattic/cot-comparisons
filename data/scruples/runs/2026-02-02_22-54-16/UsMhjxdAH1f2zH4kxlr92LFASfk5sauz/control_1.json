She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for tracking his wife's location. So, the situation is that the wife went out with a friend, didn't answer calls, and the husband, worried, used her phone's location tracking. The wife found out and is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The husband had a reason to be concerned when she didn't show up, didn't answer, and it was past their usual bedtime. But tracking her phone without her knowledge is a big privacy issue. Even if his intentions were good, the method he used invades her privacy. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. In relationships, trust and communication are vital. By secretly tracking her, he's showing a lack of trust, which can be hurtful. The fact that she was upset because he didn't trust her and that she felt it was a betrayal of privacy points to him being wrong. \n\nEven though he was worried, there are other ways he could have handled it, like contacting mutual friends or waiting a bit longer. The main issue is the lack of communication and transparency. So, the answer would likely be A, that he's in the wrong because his actions violated her privacy, regardless of his intentions.\n"
