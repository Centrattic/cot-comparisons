She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for tracking his wife's location via her phone. The story goes that the wife went out to dinner with a friend, didn't answer his calls, and he got worried. He used the Android Find My Device feature to check her location because he was concerned. But the wife found out and is upset, feeling he didn't trust her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The husband's intention was to check on his wife's safety because she didn't respond and he was worried. But tracking her phone without her knowledge could be seen as a breach of privacy, even with good intentions. On the other hand, he was genuinely concerned and had a legitimate reason for being worried, especially since she didn't come home as expected and they had early plans.\n\nNow, the ethical aspect. Privacy is a big deal in relationships. Even if the husband had good intentions, checking her location without her consent might be viewed as a violation of trust. Trust is crucial in a marriage, and actions that undermine that can be problematic. However, the husband's concern for her safety is understandable. The dilemma here is between safety and privacy.\n\nAnother angle: communication. If he had been worried, maybe he could have tried other ways to reach out or discussed tracking with her beforehand. The fact that he didn't ask her about using the tracking feature might be the main issue. The wife's reaction is about feeling untrusted, which is a significant emotional aspect. \n\nAlso, the wife came home late and was grumpy, which might have escalated the situation. The husband's actions, while out of concern, could have been handled differently. Maybe he should have discussed his worries with her after she returned instead of tracking her. \n\nIn terms of wrongdoing, it's about whether the action itself was a mistake regardless of intent. Even if the intent was good, the act of tracking without her knowledge could be considered wrong because it's a privacy issue. The husband might not be an \"asshole,\" but he made a poor decision that affected trust. \n\nThe answer could depend on cultural or personal values. Some might say that safety is more important, others that privacy is. But generally, in relationships, transparency is key. So if he had informed her about the tracking feature, it might have been okay. Since he didn't, it's a breach of trust. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because he violated his wife's privacy without her consent, even if his intentions were good. The correct answer would be A.\n"
