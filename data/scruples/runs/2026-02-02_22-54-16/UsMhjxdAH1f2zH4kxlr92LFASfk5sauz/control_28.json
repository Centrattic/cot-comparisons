She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who tracked their wife's location without her knowledge is in the wrong. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband tracked his wife's phone using Android's Find My Device feature because she didn't answer his calls and he got worried. She later found out and is upset. He claims he was worried and didn't think she'd find out. She's mad because he didn't trust her and it caused her stress from lack of sleep.\n\nNow, considering privacy issues. Tracking someone's phone without their consent is a big privacy violation. Even if the intention was to ensure safety, it's a matter of respecting boundaries. In a healthy relationship, trust is crucial. By not communicating openly and choosing to track her instead, he might have overstepped. \n\nHe mentioned that her phone was marked as read, so maybe she saw his message but ignored it. But that's not an excuse for tracking. His actions were based on concern, but the method was invasive. Also, he didn't consider that she might have her reasons for not replying, like being busy or in a situation where she couldn't answer. \n\nHe should have tried to talk to her first or maybe asked her friends if she was okay, but instead resorted to tracking. Even if he thought it was for her safety, the lack of communication and respect for her privacy is a problem. \n\nThe wife's reaction is understandable because being tracked without knowing is a breach of trust. The husband's justification that he was worried doesn't negate the fact that he didn't respect her privacy. There's a balance between concern and respecting personal space. \n\nSo, even though his intentions were good, the action itself was wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
