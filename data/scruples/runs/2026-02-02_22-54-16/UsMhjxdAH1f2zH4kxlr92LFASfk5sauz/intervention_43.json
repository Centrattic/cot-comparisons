She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong for tracking his wife's location via her phone. I need to figure out if it's A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, the situation: The husband tracked his wife's location through her phone because she was late coming home. He was worried, had tried calling and texting without response. He used a feature on his own laptop to find her phone, which ended up alerting her. She was upset and felt he didn't trust her.\n\nSo, what are the key points here? The husband's intention was out of concern. He was worried about her safety, especially since she didn't respond to his calls and texts. He had a legitimate reason to be concerned, given the time and that she usually comes home by 8. But he did it without her knowledge or consent, which is a big factor. \n\nIn terms of privacy, even in a relationship, there's an expectation of some level of privacy. Using tracking apps without permission can be seen as a violation of that. Even if the motive is concern, the method might be considered intrusive. Trust is a big part of relationships, and actions that undermine that trust can cause issues, even if the intent is good.\n\nBut there's also the argument that he was worried about her safety. If she was in danger, tracking her could be a responsible action. However, the line between concern and overstepping can be thin. Maybe there were other ways to handle it, like contacting her friend or the restaurant to check on her, instead of using the tracking feature.\n\nAnother angle: Did he have prior discussions about tracking? If they had agreed on some form of check-ins or emergency measures, maybe it's different. But in this case, he didn't inform her, and she found out through the notification. That's probably why she's upset\u2014it's the lack of communication and transparency.\n\nSo, the dilemma is between his concern for her safety and her right to privacy. The husband might not be malicious, but the act itself is a breach of privacy. In many cases, even with good intentions, violating someone's privacy can be seen as wrong. However, the context of genuine concern complicates it.\n\nIn AITA threads, the community often considers both the action and the intention. If the action was a one-time thing done out of worry, and there's no history of such behavior, the judgment might be more lenient. But the wife's perspective is also important\u2014feeling untrusted and violated can lead to justified anger.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The husband's actions, while motivated by concern, were a privacy violation. Whether it's \"in the wrong\" depends on the balance between safety and privacy. In many cases, people might say it's a mistake but not necessarily an asshole move. However, the fact that he didn't trust her enough to check in through other means (like calling her friend) might tip the scales towards him being in the wrong. \n\nBut I also need to remember that in relationships, trust and communication are key. Even if the husband was worried, the method of tracking without consent is problematic. So, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, he's in the wrong), but some might argue B (No). However, given the standard in such situations, tracking without consent is usually seen as a breach, so A might be the more common answer here.\n"
