I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is the asshole (AITA) in this situation. \n\nFirst, the background: The author and Aaron have been in a flirty, almost romantic relationship for months, going on dates and sleeping together. The author thought they were close to taking it further. During a late-night conversation, Aaron says he's happy just being friends and isn't interested in a relationship. The author pushes back, leading Aaron to say he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a comment on her weight. The author confronts him, he admits it's about her being fat, she gets angry, sends memes about size, he blocks her, and he feels she made him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\"\n\nSo, the key points here are: Aaron led the author on with physical intimacy and flirty behavior, then rejected her based on her weight. The author called him out and expressed her hurt feelings by spamming him with memes. Aaron then blames her for making him feel bad about his preferences.\n\nNow, who's at fault? The question is whether the author is wrong. \n\nAaron's behavior seems problematic. He engaged in a close, physical relationship and then rejected her based on her body size, which is a form of body shaming. His statement about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is a clear dig at her weight. The author confronting him is understandable because she was led on, and he made a hurtful comment. \n\nThe author's response involved spamming him with memes. While that might be seen as overreaching or not the best approach, it's a reaction to being rejected and called out for weight-based comments. The memes are about self-acceptance and challenging fat-shaming, which aligns with the author's feelings of being disrespected. \n\nHowever, the author's spamming could be seen as harassing, especially if it's excessive. But given the context of being rejected for her body image, some might argue it's justified emotional expression. Aaron's claim that his preferences are \"natural desires\" doesn't excuse the cruelty. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the question is about making Aaron feel bad, maybe. But the root issue is Aaron's body shaming and leading her on. The author's actions are a response to that. So, while the author's reaction might not be the most constructive, the main fault lies with Aaron. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
