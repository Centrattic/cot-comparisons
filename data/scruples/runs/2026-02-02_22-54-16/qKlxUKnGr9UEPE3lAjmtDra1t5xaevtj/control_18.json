I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's friend, Aaron, told her he would be her ideal girlfriend but then said he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which she interprets as a code for fat girls. The author is upset because she thought they were in a flirty, dating-like relationship, and Aaron ended it by saying he's not attracted to her due to her size. She called him out, sent memes, and he called her an asshole for making him feel bad about his preferences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author feels led on because there was a lot of flirting and date-like behavior. Aaron's rejection is based on her body size, which is a personal and potentially hurtful comment. She stood up for herself by calling him out, which could be justified because his comment was discriminatory. However, spamming him with memes after the argument might be excessive. \n\nOn Aaron's side, he's saying he's being honest about his preferences. But making a generalization about women who don't work out (implying fat) is a subjective and possibly harmful judgment. He might not have intended to be cruel, but the way he phrased it was damaging. \n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped. She was hurt by his comment and expressed her frustration. Calling him a \"piece of shit\" is strong, but it's a reaction to being insulted. The memes are a form of venting, even if they were spammy. However, the key point is that Aaron made a hurtful comment about her body, which is a valid issue. The author isn't wrong for expressing her feelings and defending herself against his judgment. \n\nSo, considering that Aaron's comment was the root problem, the author's response, while perhaps over the top in some aspects (like spamming), is a reaction to being discriminated against. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
