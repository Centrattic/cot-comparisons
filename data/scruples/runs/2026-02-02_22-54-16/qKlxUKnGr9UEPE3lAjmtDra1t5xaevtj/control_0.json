I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author had a flirty friendship with Aaron. They went on dates, slept together, and the author felt like they were more than friends. Then, when the author wanted to take things further, Aaron said he's not into relationships and specifically mentioned not being attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interpreted as a code for fat girls. The author confronted him, and after some back and forth, the author called him out and then spammed him with memes. Aaron got angry and said the author made him feel like a bad person for his natural desires.\n\nHmm. First, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The author feels led on because there was a lot of flirting and date-like behavior, which might have given the impression of a romantic interest. Then, when the author expresses wanting to take things further, Aaron's response is dismissive and possibly using a body-shaming comment. The author then reacts by confronting him and spamming him with memes that mock his comment. Aaron responds by saying the author is an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nThe key points here are: Did the author have a right to be upset about being led on? Was Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out a fair response? And was the author justified in their reaction, including the memes?\n\nFirst, leading someone on is generally considered wrong, especially if there's a clear expectation of a romantic relationship. If Aaron was engaging in flirty behavior and dates, that could be seen as leading the author on, which would be on him. But when the author wanted to take things further, Aaron's response was to say he's not into girls who don't work out. That's problematic because it's a form of body shaming and makes a judgment based on appearance. The author's interpretation of \"not work out\" as a code for fat is reasonable, given that not working out can be associated with weight, though it's not always the case. However, making a comment about someone's attractiveness based on their fitness could be seen as superficial and hurtful.\n\nThen the author confronts him and says he's a piece of shit, which might be harsh, but the author was clearly hurt. The memes sent were mocking, but given the context, the author felt wronged. Aaron's response is that the author is making him feel bad about his \"natural desires,\" which is a bit of a defense of his own bias. It's important to consider whether it's okay for someone to express attraction based on physical attributes. While people can have preferences, using them to dismiss someone after leading them on is questionable.\n\nThe author's actions of spamming with memes are a bit much, but they are a reaction to the hurt. However, the core issue is Aaron's body-shaming comment and leading the author on. The author is not in the wrong for calling out Aaron's behavior. The real problem is Aaron's actions, not the author's reaction. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
