I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after a situation where their friend Aaron told them they were his \"ideal girlfriend\" but then said he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author confronted him, he admitted it was about being fat, and then they got into a fight where the author spammed him with memes. Aaron called them an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics of their relationship. They've been friends for a few months, with flirtatious behavior and what the author considers dates. So, there's a romantic context here. When the author wanted to take things further, Aaron said he's just friends and cited not working out as a reason. The author directly asked if it was because they're fat, and he confirmed. \n\nExpressing attraction and then rejecting based on appearance can be confusing. If Aaron was leading her on, that's a problem. But the author's response involved name-calling and spamming with memes. That could come off as harsh, especially in a heated moment. However, Aaron's admission that he's only attracted to women who work out (which is a stereotype or bias) raises issues. The author was hurt and responded emotionally, which is understandable but maybe not the best approach.\n\nThe key points are: Aaron's mixed signals (ideal girlfriend but not into her because of weight), the author confronting him directly and he admitted it, and the author's reaction. While it's clear Aaron was using a veiled insult, the author's response might be seen as aggressive. But given that Aaron was the one with the underlying bias, the author isn't entirely wrong. They have the right to be upset and express that, even if it was done in a confrontational way. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled it more calmly, maybe to better understand Aaron's perspective without taking it personally. But the main issue here is Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out, which is a harmful stereotype. The author's reaction, while not ideal, is a response to being dismissed for a superficial reason. So, the author isn't in the wrong. They were defending themselves against a biased remark. \n\nThe answer should be B (No), because the author was responding to being led on and then rejected based on weight, which is a valid issue, even if their response was not the most mature. The problem lies more with Aaron's comment and the mixed signals he gave.\n"
