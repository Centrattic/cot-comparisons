I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and Aaron were in a flirty, almost dating situation. The author thought they were moving towards a relationship, but Aaron said he's happy just being friends. The author wanted more. Then, when pressed, Aaron said he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author confronts him, gets a yes, reacts angrily, and then spams him with memes. Aaron says the author is an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. \n\nOn one hand, Aaron might have his own preferences, and it's his right to say he's not attracted to someone. But the way he phrased it as \"girls who don't work out\" could be a euphemism for body size, which is a sensitive topic. The author is hurt and angry because Aaron led her on by being flirty and having dates, then dumps her with a comment that seems to imply she's not attractive enough. \n\nThe author's reaction was to call Aaron a \"piece of shit\" and spam him with memes. That's pretty harsh, but maybe justified if she felt she was being body-shamed. However, spamming someone after being rejected could be seen as aggressive. \n\nNow, about whether the author is in the wrong. Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is problematic. It's a form of body shaming, even if he calls it \"natural desires.\" The author is within her right to be upset and confront him. However, her response\u2014calling him names and spamming him\u2014might not be the best way to handle it. But given the context of being led on and then dumped with a hurtful comment, her reaction is understandable. \n\nIn terms of accountability, Aaron is clearly the one who made the hurtful comment and then dismissed the author's feelings. The author is reacting to that. While her response was harsh, the root issue is Aaron's behavior. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. She's standing up for herself after being treated poorly. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
