I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario involves a friend, Aaron, who's been leading the author on with flirtatious behavior and dates. Then, when the author wants to take things further, Aaron says he's only interested in women who work out, implying the author is fat. The author confronts him and then proceeds to spam his social media with memes related to body size.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The author felt Aaron was leading her on, and Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is a clear slight. The author's reaction is to call him out and then send memes. Aaron responds by saying she made him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, Aaron's behavior\u2014leading her on and then making a comment about her weight\u2014is problematic. The author was justified in feeling hurt and confronting him. However, spamming social media with memes might be seen as harsh or unprofessional. But given the context, it's a reaction to being insulted. On the other hand, Aaron's excuse that it's his \"natural desires\" is a bit of a cop-out and possibly justifies his prejudice.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respect. Aaron didn't respect the author's feelings and made a discriminatory remark. The author's response, while perhaps excessive, is a reaction to being disrespected. The question is whether her actions cross the line. Spamming memes could be seen as public shaming, which is not ideal, but if the content is about body positivity, maybe it's a form of standing up for herself. However, the user is asking if she's in the wrong. Since she was the one on the receiving end of the insult, and Aaron's behavior was inappropriate, her reaction might be understandable, but maybe not the best approach. But considering the context, she's not entirely in the wrong. So the answer would likely be B (No), as she's not in the wrong, though her response could be improved.\n"
