I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend named Aaron who told the author that she would be his ideal girlfriend but then said he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the details. The author and Aaron have been in a flirty, almost dating situation. The author wanted to take their relationship to the next level, but Aaron said he was happy just being friends. When pressed, he admitted it's because he's not into girls who don't work out, which the author sees as a way of saying she's fat. The author responded angrily, called him a piece of shit, and then proceeded to spam him with memes related to body positivity. Aaron then blocked her but accused her of making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\"\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know my take. So, I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nFirst, Aaron's actions: he led the author on by being flirty and going on dates, which could be seen as leading her on. When she wanted to commit, he rejected her, and gave a reason that seems like a backhanded compliment or a veiled insult. His comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is problematic. If he meant that the author is fat, that's a direct insult, even if it's wrapped in a euphemism. It's a common tactic to mask weight-based judgments, which are often considered socially unacceptable. \n\nThen the author's reaction: she was hurt and angry, which is understandable. Calling him a piece of shit and then spamming him with memes might be seen as harsh, but given the context of being rejected and insulted, her anger is justified. However, spamming his Facebook could be seen as overreacting, even if it's a form of venting. \n\nBut the key point here is whether the author is in the wrong. The question is about her actions. She didn't do anything to deserve the insult. She was honest about wanting a relationship, and when rejected, she expressed her hurt. Her actions (cursing, spamming) are a response to being insulted. Arguably, Aaron is the one who initiated the conflict by making a derogatory comment. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author overreacted by spamming him, but the initial insult from Aaron is more serious. In AITA scenarios, the focus is on whose actions were more in the wrong. The author's actions, while potentially harsh, were a reaction to being insulted. Aaron's comment was offensive and hypocritical given their prior flirty interactions. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because she was responding to an insult. Her actions, while perhaps aggressive, stem from being hurt and trying to defend herself. Aaron's behavior was the root cause, so the answer should be B.\n"
