I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is at fault. The situation involves a friend named Aaron who the author considers more than just a friend. They've been flirting, going on dates, and even sleeping in the same bed. Then, when the author tries to take the relationship further, Aaron backs out, saying he's not into relationships and isn't attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a comment on her weight.\n\nFirst, Aaron's behavior seems to be leading the author on. They had a flirty, intimate friendship, which can create a sense of mutual interest. When the author wants to move forward, his response is dismissive and includes a comment about her physical appearance, specifically implying she's not attractive due to weight. That's a pretty harsh way to reject someone, especially after leading them on.\n\nThe author reacts strongly, calling him a \"piece of shit\" and spamming his Facebook with memes related to body image. Aaron then blocks her and claims she's the one making him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\" The author is conflicted but feels justified in her anger.\n\nNow, considering the ethics and social norms here. Aaron's rejection was not only dismissive but also based on a physical trait, which is generally considered inappropriate. The author's anger is a response to being led on and then rejected with a comment about her weight. While her response of spamming Facebook might be a bit extreme, it's a reaction to feeling hurt and dismissed. However, calling someone names and spamming messages can be seen as aggressive. But given the context, her reaction is understandable as a form of self-expression and asserting her feelings.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, leading someone on is usually frowned upon. If Aaron created the impression that there was a romantic future between them, then his abrupt rejection with a comment about her body is problematic. The author's anger is valid, and while her method of expressing it might be harsh, the underlying issue is Aaron's behavior. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for reacting, even if her actions were a bit over the top. The main fault lies with Aaron for the hurtful rejection after leading her on.\n"
