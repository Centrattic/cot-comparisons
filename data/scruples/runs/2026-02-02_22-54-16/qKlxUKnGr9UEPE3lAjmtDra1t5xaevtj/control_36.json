I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy named Aaron who was in a flirty, quasi-relationship with the author. They had what she considered dates and slept in the same bed. Then, when she wanted to take things further, he said he wasn't into relationships and made a comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out, which she interpreted as a code for fat girls.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author felt led on by Aaron, which is a key point. If Aaron was engaging in flirtatious behavior and dates, creating the impression of a potential romantic relationship, and then suddenly pulls back by making a derogatory comment, that's a problem. His comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is clearly a veiled insult about her weight. That's not just a personal preference; it's a disrespectful way to reject someone, especially after leading them on.\n\nThe author's reaction was to lash out by spamming him with memes about body size. That's hurtful and could be seen as aggressive. However, his initial comment was the root cause. The question is whether his comment was so offensive that her response was justified. While spamming someone with memes isn't ideal, it's a reaction to a hurtful rejection. \n\nOn the other hand, Aaron apologized but then accused her of making him feel bad for his \"natural desires,\" which is problematic. If someone is making harmful comments about body image, it's not about their natural desires but their lack of respect. The author's anger is understandable given that he led her on and then insulted her. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were disproportionate. While her response was harsh, it's in reaction to being insulted and led on. The initial comment from Aaron is the core issue. So, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because she was reacting to a disrespectful rejection. However, her method of responding (spamming) is unprofessional. But considering the context, it's a justified reaction to being mistreated. \n\nIn AITA terms, the decision often hinges on who started the conflict. Since Aaron made the offensive remark first, the author's response, while not perfect, is a reaction to his behavior. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (Not the Asshole) because the responsibility lies more with Aaron's actions.\n"
