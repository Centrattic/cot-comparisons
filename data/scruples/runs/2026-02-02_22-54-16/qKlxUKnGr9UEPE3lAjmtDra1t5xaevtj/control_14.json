I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a guy named Aaron and the author's relationship. They've been friends for a few months, and their interactions have been flirty with dates and sleeping together. The author thought they were more than friends but Aaron said he just wanted to stay friends. Then, when the author pushes for more, Aaron says he's not into girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as being about weight. The author confronts him, and Aaron confirms it's about weight. The author gets angry, calls him names, and spams him with memes. Aaron responds by saying the author made him feel bad for his \"natural desires,\" and the author is conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author felt Aaron led them on by being flirty and having a physical relationship, making the author believe there was potential for a romantic relationship. When confronted, Aaron gives a reason that's clearly a way to avoid hurting feelings but is actually about weight, which is a sensitive and potentially discriminatory issue. The author's reaction is to lash out and spam him with memes that mock his weight-based comment. Then Aaron calls the author an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. On one hand, Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is problematic. It's a coded way of saying he doesn't like fat girls, which is a form of weight-based discrimination. The author is right to call him out on that, as it's a harmful attitude. However, the author's method of responding\u2014spamming him with memes and name-calling\u2014might be seen as excessive. But given the context of being led on and then faced with a discriminatory comment, the author's anger is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, Aaron's reaction is to frame his preferences as \"natural desires,\" which is a way to justify discriminatory behavior. The author is defending against that by asserting their worth and challenging his prejudices. The author's actions, while maybe harsh, are a reaction to being made to feel bad about their body and being rejected for reasons beyond their control.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't in the wrong because they're standing up for themselves against a discriminatory comment. Aaron's behavior is the issue here, not the author's response. While the author could have handled it differently, the core issue is Aaron's prejudice, not the author's reaction. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole in this situation.\n"
