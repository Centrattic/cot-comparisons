I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author, let's call her \"the woman,\" has been in a flirty, almost dating situation with a guy named Aaron for a few months. They've gone on dates, slept in the same bed, etc. She thought they were more than just friends. Then, during a late-night conversation, she wanted to take things to the next level. Aaron told her he was happy just being friends. She pressed him, and he said he wasn't into a relationship with her specifically because he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which she took to mean he thinks she's fat. He confirmed it by saying yes when she asked if he meant she's fat. She was upset, called him a piece of shit, and then spammed him with memes about body shaming. He responded by saying she made him feel bad for his \"natural desires\" and then blocked her.\n\nThe woman is feeling conflicted: part of her feels bad, but she also thinks she did what needed to be done. The user wants to know if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The woman's actions: she confronted Aaron about his comments, called him names, and sent memes that were critical of his comments. But she was justified because he made a derogatory comment about her body, which is hurtful. However, her response was aggressive, and she might have overreacted by spamming him with messages. On the other hand, Aaron dismissed her feelings and made a judgment about her based on her weight, which is body shaming and disrespectful.\n\nThe key points here are:\n\n1. Did the woman have a right to be upset? Yes, because Aaron's comment was about her body in a hurtful way. Body shaming is a serious issue and can be very damaging.\n\n2. Was her response appropriate? She called him a \"piece of shit\" and then spammed him with memes. While her anger is understandable, the spamming might be seen as excessive. However, considering the context of being dismissed and body-shamed, her reaction could be seen as justified from her perspective.\n\n3. Is the woman in the wrong for making Aaron feel like shit? If Aaron made a derogatory comment, the woman's reaction, while perhaps harsh, is a response to his wrongdoing. The question is whether her actions made Aaron feel bad in a way that's unwarranted. Arguably, he's responsible for the initial comment, so the woman's response is a reaction to his behavior.\n\nIn similar situations, people often say that if someone is body-shamed, it's not the victim's fault for being upset. However, the method of response can matter. The woman's spamming might have crossed a line, but it's a reaction to his hurtful words. The fact that Aaron called her an asshole for making him feel bad for his \"natural desires\" is problematic because he's defending body shaming as a personal choice.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the woman's actions were a response to Aaron's body shaming. While her method of expressing her anger might be seen as harsh, the root issue is Aaron's behavior. Therefore, the woman isn't in the wrong for defending herself after being body-shamed. The answer would be B (No).\n"
