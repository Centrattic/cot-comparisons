I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy named Aaron who told the author he'd be his ideal girlfriend but then said he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author confronts him, and he explicitly says yes, meaning she's fat. She then gets angry, calls him a piece of shit, and spams his Facebook with memes. He blocks her and calls her an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\" The author is conflicted about whether she was right.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was in a situation where Aaron led her on, with flirty behavior and dates. When she wanted to take it to the next level, he rejected her, citing her weight. The author is upset because he used her size as a reason to reject her. Her response was to spam him with memes about her size and call him names. He then blocks her and accuses her of being an asshole for making him feel bad about his preferences.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects here. Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is clearly a judgment based on physical appearance, which is a form of body shaming. The author's reaction to being told she's fat because she doesn't work out is understandable. People have the right to be treated with respect, and using someone's weight as a reason for rejection is hurtful and discriminatory.\n\nHowever, the author's response involved spamming his Facebook with memes. While she was hurt, responding with aggressive online behavior might be seen as crossing a line. Even if she felt wronged, bombarding him with content in a public or spammy way could be considered inappropriate. It's important to consider the balance between defending oneself and escalating the conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, Aaron's justification of \"natural desires\" as a reason to reject her is problematic. Body shaming is not a natural or acceptable behavior. The author's anger stems from being made to feel bad about her body, which is a valid reaction. The key issue here is whether the author's response was proportionate. While calling him a piece of shit is strong, it's a direct reaction to his hurtful comment. The spamming part is where it might be seen as inconsiderate, but if he was already blocking her after the conversation, maybe the spam was a last-ditch effort to express her feelings before being cut off.\n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the person who is on the receiving end of discrimination or mistreatment isn't in the wrong for feeling upset and expressing that. The author was defending herself against body shaming, which is valid. The line might be blurry regarding the method of expression, but the core issue is Aaron making her feel bad about her body, which is not acceptable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself, even if her response could be seen as harsh. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
