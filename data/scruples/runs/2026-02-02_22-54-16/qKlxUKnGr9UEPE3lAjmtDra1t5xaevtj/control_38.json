I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend, Aaron, who told the author he considered her his \"ideal girlfriend\" but then said he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interpreted as a codeword for fat girls. They had a flirty, almost dating relationship, but when she wanted to take it further, he pulled back and made that comment about not working out. The author then expressed anger, called him a piece of shit, and spammed him with memes. He clocked her for being an ass.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down. First, Aaron led her on by being flirty and going on dates, which could be seen as leading her to believe there was a romantic possibility. But when she wanted to take it further, he rejected her and made a comment about her weight indirectly. That's where the conflict starts.\n\nThe author's response was to call him a \"piece of shit\" and spam him with memes. The key points here are whether she overreacted or if Aaron's comments were the issue. The phrase \"girls who don't work out\" can be a subtle way of expressing weight bias, which is a form of discrimination. So, the author's anger is understandable because Aaron rejected her based on her body, which is a sensitive issue.\n\nHowever, the author's reaction included name-calling and spamming, which could be seen as harsh. But considering that she felt led on and then rejected based on a negative trait, her emotional response is justified. The question is whether her actions were in the wrong. While yelling at someone is never nice, the context of being disrespected after a perceived lead might mitigate that. \n\nOn the other hand, Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is problematic, but he might not have intended to be cruel. The author's immediate reaction was to confront him, which is a valid emotional response. The follow-up spamming might be excessive, but it's a common way people express anger now. \n\nSo, the balance here is between both parties' actions. Aaron made a comment that can be seen as discriminatory, leading to the author feeling disrespected. The author's response was emotional, but not entirely out of line given the context. The key is whether the author was in the wrong for reacting that way. Since the initial issue was Aaron's rejection based on weight, the author's anger is justified. Therefore, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
