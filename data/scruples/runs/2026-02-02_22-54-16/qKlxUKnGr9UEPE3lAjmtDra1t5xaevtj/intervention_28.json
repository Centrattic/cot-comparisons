I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after their interaction with their friend Aaron. The situation involves Aaron leading the author on with flirtatious behavior and then ultimately rejecting them by saying he's not into girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as being about weight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that they've been in a flirty, date-like relationship with Aaron, which suggests that Aaron might have given them mixed signals. When the author pushes for a real relationship, Aaron backs out and makes a comment about physical attraction related to working out. That's pretty hurtful and could be seen as a way to avoid the emotional part of the rejection.\n\nThen, the author responds by calling Aaron a \"piece of shit\" and spamming him with memes. Aaron then blocks them and accuses the author of making him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\" The author is conflicted but feels they said what needed to be said.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is problematic. It's a form of body shaming and dismissive of the author's feelings. The author's reaction, while perhaps harsh (spamming with memes), is a response to being led on and then rejected with a hurtful remark. \n\nHowever, the author's response might be seen as aggressive. While the content of the memes could be justified as a reaction to body-shaming, the method (spamming) could be considered excessive. But given the context of being emotionally manipulated and then shamed, it's understandable. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were in line with their right to express their hurt and anger. Since Aaron was the one who made the hurtful comment, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for responding, even if the response was a bit over the top. The line between defending oneself and being overly aggressive can be blurry, but in this case, the author's main transgression is reacting to being mistreated. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
