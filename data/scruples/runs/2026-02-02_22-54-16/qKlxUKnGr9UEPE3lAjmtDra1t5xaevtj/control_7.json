I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's read through the situation again. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is the asshole (AITA) after their friend Aaron made a comment about them being his \"ideal girlfriend\" but then also said he isn't attracted to girls who don't work out, which they take as a code for fat girls.\n\nFirst, the background: They've been friends for a few months, it's very flirty, they go on dates, sleep in the same bed. The user thought they were more than friends. Then, after a conversation where the user wanted to take things further, Aaron said he just wanted to stay friends. The user pushed for more, and Aaron said he's not into a relationship with her and that he's not attracted to girls who don't work out. The user interpreted this as fat-shaming. They called him a piece of shit and started spamming him with memes about body size. Aaron blocked them but said they made him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\"\n\nNow, the user is conflicted: they feel like they said what needed to be said but also a bit bad. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. Aaron made a comment that was hurtful and possibly fat-shaming. The user confronted him, which makes sense because being told you're unattractive in a way that's offensive is not okay. However, after that, the user started spamming him with memes. That part might be crossing a line. Even if Aaron was wrong, responding with spam could be seen as aggressive and not healthy. The user had the right to be upset, but maybe the way they responded was excessive. Also, the user was in a situation where Aaron was leading them on, which is manipulative. So the user's frustration is valid. But when it comes to the spamming, that's probably not appropriate. So maybe the user is partly in the wrong, but not entirely. However, the original comment from Aaron was the main issue. The user had the right to express their feelings, but the spamming might be the asshole move here. So the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they took it too far with the spam, even if the initial confrontation was justified. Alternatively, maybe not, because Aaron's comment was hurtful. It's a bit tricky. Some might say that the user had the right to defend themselves from fat-shaming, but the spamming was uncalled for. So the author's actions after the initial confrontation might be the issue. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
