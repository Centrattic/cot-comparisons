I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author had a friend, Aaron, who was leading her on with flirtatious behavior and dates. Then, when she tried to take it further, he said he wasn't into a relationship and specifically mentioned not being attracted to girls who don't work out, which she took as a comment on her size.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The user is upset because Aaron basically said he isn't interested in women who don't work out, which she interpreted as a fat-shaming comment. She called him out, and he then accused her of making him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\" The question is whether she was wrong in her response.\n\nFrom the scenario, Aaron's actions seem to be leading her on. They had a flirty, dating-like relationship, and then he suddenly backs out and gives a reason that can be seen as derogatory. The author's response was to confront him and send memes that criticize his comment. He then defends himself by saying his preferences are natural, and she feels justified in her anger.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's important to consider if she crossed a line. When he was dismissive and made a comment about her weight, her reaction was to express her hurt and anger. Sending memes might be seen as a bit harsh, but given the context, it's a reaction to being insulted. She wasn't attacking his character beyond calling him out for the fat-shaming comment. \n\nOn the other hand, Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is problematic. Weight-based discrimination is generally frowned upon, and his dismissal of her feelings as \"natural desires\" is insensitive. The author's actions were a response to being hurt and belittled. While her approach might have been confrontational, it's understandable given the situation. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She was standing up for herself after being led on and then insulted. The key here is that she's defending herself against a derogatory remark, even if her method was a bit aggressive. The answer would be B, meaning she's not in the wrong.\n"
