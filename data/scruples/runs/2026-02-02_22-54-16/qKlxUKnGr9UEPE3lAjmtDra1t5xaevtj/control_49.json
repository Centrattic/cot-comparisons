I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy named Aaron who told the author he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a comment on her weight. Then she called him out and responded with some memes, leading Aaron to say she made him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and Aaron had a flirty, almost relationship-like dynamic. She wanted to take it further, but he rejected her, giving a comment about not liking girls who don't work out. She confronts him directly about implying she's fat, and then sends memes that are clearly about body size. Aaron then blocks her and accuses her of making him feel bad for his preferences.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From the description, Aaron's comment seems to be a double standard. He was leading her on with flirty behavior and dates but then rejected her based on her body size. The author's response was to call him out and send memes that highlight the issue. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, if Aaron made a derogatory comment about her weight, the author is justified in being upset. However, responding with spamming him with memes might be excessive. But considering the context of being led on, maybe her reaction is a reasonable expression of her hurt feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is problematic. It's a form of body shaming, and the author is pointing out the hypocrisy if he was previously engaging in a close, flirty relationship with her. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for reacting to the hurtful comment. While her method of responding with memes might be seen as harsh, it's a reaction to being body-shamed. The key issue here is Aaron's initial comment and his leading her on. The author's actions are a response to being mistreated. Therefore, the answer would be B, meaning she's not in the wrong.\n"
