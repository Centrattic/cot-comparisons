I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me think through this. The user is asking if the author (the person in the \"AITA\" scenario) is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend, Aaron, who the author was in a flirty, almost dating relationship with. He led her on by having physical intimacy, \"dates,\" etc., but when she wanted to take it further, he rejected her. Then he made a comment implying that she's fat and not attractive to him unless she works out. She confronted him and was very angry, sent him lots of messages, and he called her an asshole. Now she's unsure if she was right to react that way.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. Aaron led her on by acting like they were more than friends. He had physical contact, went on dates, slept in the same bed, which could be interpreted as leading her on. Then, when she wanted to take the next step, he rejected her by saying he's not into girls who don't work out, which she took as a fat-shaming comment. She confronted him and was very harsh in her response. He then blocked her after calling her an asshole for \"natural desires.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From her perspective, she felt led on, which is a red flag. If someone is in a physical or romantic relationship, they have a responsibility to be honest about their intentions. If Aaron was pretending to be in a romantic relationship but wasn't actually interested, that's misleading. However, when she pushed for a relationship, he was honest (though maybe unkind) about his reasons.\n\nHer reaction: she called him a piece of shit, sent him memes that were confrontational and maybe hurtful. That's where her fault might lie. Even if she was wronged, responding with aggressive messages might not be the best approach. He called her an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires,\" which could be his way of deflecting blame. But is his comment about not liking girls who don't work out a natural desire? That's subjective. Some people have preferences, but using weight as a basis is problematic and can be seen as discriminatory.\n\nThe author's side: She was hurt, felt manipulated, and responded emotionally. Her actions were a reaction to being led on and then rejected with a fat-shaming remark. But she sent spam messages, which could be seen as harassment. However, considering the context of emotional manipulation, her response is understandable in terms of anger.\n\nOn the other hand, Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is clearly a judgment based on her body, which is hurtful and potentially harmful. He led her on, then dismissed her with a comment that could be seen as discriminatory. His actions were wrong, but she overreacted by spamming him with memes, which might be considered crossing a line.\n\nSo, the balance here is between the wrong done to her (being led on and fat-shamed) and her reaction (harassment). In AITA questions, the community often considers intent and actions. If the author's actions were a direct response to being wronged, she might not be the ass. However, if her actions were excessive and not justified, she could be at fault.\n\nIn this case, Aaron led her on and made a hurtful comment. The author's response, while harsh, was a reaction to that. However, spamming someone with memes after a breakup can be seen as aggressive. The community often factors in whether the person's response is proportionate. If Aaron was in the wrong, the author's response might be understandable. But if her actions were unkind and went too far, she could be seen as at fault.\n\nBut given that Aaron's comment was a form of fat-shaming and he was leading her on, the author might be justified in her anger. However, the method of her response (spamming) could be problematic. The AITA community tends to be forgiving if someone is reacting to being wronged, but if the response is excessive, it's a different story. The key is whether her actions were reasonable. Since Aaron was in the wrong, the author might not be the ass, but it's a close call.\n"
