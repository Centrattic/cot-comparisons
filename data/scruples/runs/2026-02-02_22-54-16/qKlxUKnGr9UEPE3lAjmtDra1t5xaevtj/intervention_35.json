I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after a situation where a friend, Aaron, called her his ideal girlfriend but then mentioned he's not into girls who don't work out, implying she's fat. The author felt led on and reacted by calling him out and spamming his social media with memes.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The author and Aaron had a flirty, close relationship with dates and sharing a bed. She wanted to take it further, but he pulled back, citing that he's not into girls who don't work out. She confronted him, he admitted it was about her weight, and she expressed her hurt. He then called her an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\" The author is conflicted but feels justified.\n\nSo, who's at fault? The key points are: Aaron led her on by being flirty and spending time together, then rejected her based on her weight. The author's reaction was to confront him and send memes, which he found offensive. The question is whether her reaction was wrong.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, leading someone on when you're not interested in committing is generally considered wrong. If Aaron was intentionally keeping her on a string, that's his fault. However, the author's response involved public shaming via memes, which could be seen as aggressive. But considering the context\u2014he made a comment about her body weight, which is a sensitive issue\u2014her reaction might be a justified expression of her hurt.\n\nHowever, spamming social media is a bit much. While understandable, it's not the most mature way to handle it. But given that he admitted to making the comment about her weight, her reaction is about standing up for herself. The real issue is Aaron's behavior: being dismissive and making a fat-shaming comment. The author's response, while perhaps excessive in method, is a reaction to being treated poorly.\n\nSo, in terms of who's at fault, it's more on Aaron for leading her on and making hurtful comments. The author's actions, while not ideal in execution, stem from being wronged. The question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she was reacting to his harmful behavior, it's not her fault. The answer is B.\n"
