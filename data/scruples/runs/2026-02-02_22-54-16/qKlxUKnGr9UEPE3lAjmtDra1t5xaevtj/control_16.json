I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nThe author and their friend Aaron have been in a flirty, almost romantic relationship for a few months. They go on dates, sleep in the same bed, which the author considers more than just friends. Then, after watching a show, the author wants to take things further, but Aaron says he's only interested in being friends. The author pushes, and Aaron says he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, implying the author might be fat. The author confronts him directly, and he confirms. The author then calls him a \"piece of shit\" and spams him with memes about body size. Aaron blocks the author and calls them an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\" The author is conflicted, feeling half bad but also justified.\n\nSo, the key points here are about consent and leading someone on. If Aaron led the author on by being flirty and going on dates but then later rejected them based on their body size, that's a problem. The author was hurt and responded emotionally, which is understandable. However, spamming someone with memes after a breakup might be seen as crossing a line, even if the other person was rude.\n\nBut Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is problematic. It's hurtful and objectifying. The author was right to confront him. However, the response of calling him a \"piece of shit\" and spamming him could be seen as aggressive. The question is whether the author overreacted or if they were within their rights to express their hurt and anger.\n\nIn terms of the AITA framework, the person who made a hurtful comment (Aaron) is the one who's wrong. The author's reaction is a response to being rejected in a hurtful way. But does the author's method of expressing their feelings make them the asshole? Maybe partially, but the root issue is Aaron's behavior. The author was wronged, so their reaction is understandable, but maybe they should have handled it differently. However, in the context of the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the answer is based on who is more at fault, the author isn't in the wrong because they were responding to being rejected based on their body image, which is a valid issue. But their method of response might be seen as overly aggressive. However, given the context of being hurt and the prior actions of Aaron leading them on, the author's actions are a justified reaction to being mistreated. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
