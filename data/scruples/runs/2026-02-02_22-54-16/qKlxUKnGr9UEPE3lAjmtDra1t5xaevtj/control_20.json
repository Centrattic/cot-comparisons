I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation where their friend Aaron told them they were his \"ideal girlfriend\" but then followed up by saying he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as code for fat girls. The author confronted him, and Aaron admitted he meant that. The author then called him a piece of shit and started spamming him with memes, leading to Aaron blocking them and calling the author an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author and Aaron had a relationship that was more than friends, with flirting and dates. The author wanted to take it further, but Aaron said he wasn't into a relationship. The key issue here is whether the author was wrong for calling Aaron out on what he said. \n\nOn one hand, Aaron made a comment that the author found offensive. The author directly asked if he meant they were fat, and he confirmed it. That's pretty harsh. The author's reaction was to confront him and then spam him with memes. While confronting someone in person might be okay, spamming them afterward with potentially hurtful content could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was in a situation where they felt led on. If Aaron wasn't genuinely interested in a relationship but was giving mixed signals, the author might feel wronged. However, when the author wanted to escalate the relationship, Aaron was honest about his lack of attraction, which is his right. The author's response of calling him names and spamming might be seen as inappropriate, even if Aaron made a hurtful comment. \n\nThe question is whether the author's reaction was justified. While it's valid to be upset and express that, the method of doing so (spamming with memes and insults) could be considered the asshole behavior. The author's half feeling bad suggests some awareness that their actions might be excessive. \n\nAlso, Aaron's statement about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is problematic because it's a fatphobic comment. The author was right to call him out on the admission, but the way they followed up might be what's causing the conflict. \n\nSo, the author isn't entirely in the wrong for confronting Aaron, but the spamming part is probably where they went wrong. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because while the comment from Aaron was hurtful, the author's response of spamming and aggressive messages is also inappropriate. Both parties have some responsibility here, but the question is specifically about the author's actions. The author's own behavior, regardless of Aaron's comment, could be seen as the asshole move.\n"
