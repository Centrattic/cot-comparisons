I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is that Aaron, a guy the author has been seeing in a flirty, date-like way, told her he's happy just being friends, but then made a comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author confronted him, he confirmed it, and then she called him a piece of shit and spammed him with memes. He responded by calling her an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author felt led on because of the flirty behavior and dates. When she wanted to take it further, he rejected her and gave a reason that seems like a body-shaming comment. She confronted him and he admitted it. Her reaction was anger and sending memes, which he took as her attacking his natural desires. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, Aaron gave a hurtful and potentially discriminatory reason for not wanting a relationship. The author was right to express her hurt and anger because that comment is clearly targeting her body, which is not acceptable. However, the way she handled it by spamming him with memes might be seen as harsh or overreacting, but given the context, it's understandable. The key point is that Aaron's comment was the problem, not her reaction. People have the right to express their feelings when they're disrespected. Even if her approach was a bit confrontational, the root issue is his discriminatory remark. So the author isn't in the wrong; the fault lies with Aaron for making that comment. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
