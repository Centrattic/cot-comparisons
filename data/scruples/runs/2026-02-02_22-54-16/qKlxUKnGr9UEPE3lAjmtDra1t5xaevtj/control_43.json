I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy named Aaron who told the author he's his ideal girlfriend but then said he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which is code for fat girls. The author confronted him, and Aaron admitted it was about her being fat. The author then called Aaron a piece of shit and spammed him with memes. Aaron said she made him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\" The author feels conflicted but is unsure if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author and Aaron were in a flirty, almost dating situation. Aaron led her on, and when she wanted to take it further, he rejected her by making a comment about her weight. That's clearly hurtful and using body-shaming as an excuse. The author's response was to call him out and spam him with memes. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. On one hand, Aaron made a derogatory comment about her body, which is unacceptable. The author had the right to be upset and confront him. But is her response appropriate? Spamming him with memes might be seen as aggressive, even if justified by his actions. However, considering he admitted it was about her being fat, she's not in the wrong for being angry. \n\nThe user is asking for a judgment. The key factors here are Aaron's body-shaming and the author's reaction. While the author's response might be a bit harsh, the root cause is Aaron's inconsiderate and hurtful comment. So the author isn't the asshole here. She's standing up for herself after being treated poorly. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
