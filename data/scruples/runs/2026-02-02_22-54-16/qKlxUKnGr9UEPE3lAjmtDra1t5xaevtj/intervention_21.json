I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The key points here are the friend's comments about wanting the author to be his \"ideal girlfriend\" but then also saying he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author felt led on because they had a flirty, date-like relationship. When the author pushed for a relationship, the friend declined, citing attraction issues related to working out, which the author took as fat-shaming.\n\nFirst, does the author have a valid reaction? The friend's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is clearly a negative judgment based on body type. The author is upset because they felt the friend was leading them on with a flirty dynamic but then rejected them based on appearance. The author's response was to call the friend out and send memes that criticize him for his attitude. The friend then blocked the author and accused them of making him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\"\n\nNow, considering social norms and respect. The author was in a situation where they felt they were being rejected for a superficial reason. They expressed their feelings, which is reasonable when you're hurt. However, the method they used\u2014spamming with memes and being confrontational\u2014might be seen as harsh. But given the friend's fat-shaming comment, the author's reaction could be seen as a justified stand against being devalued.\n\nThe friend's justification of his \"natural desires\" is problematic because it's using personal preferences as an excuse for discriminatory behavior. The author is defending their right to be respected, even if they were in a situation where they might have been vulnerable. \n\nSo, the author's actions are a response to being disrespected and led on. While the method might be aggressive, the underlying issue is about being treated badly. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
