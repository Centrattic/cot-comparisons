I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a guy named Aaron and the author, who had a flirty, almost romantic relationship. The key points here are that Aaron told the author he was her \"ideal girlfriend\" but then said he's not into girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author then reacts strongly, calling Aaron a piece of shit and spamming him with memes. Aaron responds by saying she's an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's reactions are justified. The author was led on by Aaron, who had a flirty relationship and even went on dates. When she wanted to take it further, he rejected her and gave a reason that seems to be about her weight. That's pretty hurtful. The author's response was to express her anger through messages and memes, which might be seen as aggressive. But considering Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out (which is a veiled way of saying fat girls), the author's anger is understandable. She was rejected based on her body, which is a form of body shaming.\n\nNow, Aaron's defense is that it's his \"natural desires.\" But making a comment like that in a situation where you've been leading someone on is problematic. The author had every right to call him out for the double standard. However, the way she communicated it\u2014spamming him with memes\u2014might be seen as harsh. But given the context, her hurt and anger are valid. The question is whether her actions were wrong. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. Aaron definitely made a hurtful comment, which the author rightly called out. The author's reaction, while maybe aggressive, is a response to being body-shamed and led on. So, the author isn't entirely wrong. The answer would likely be B (No), because she's standing up for herself against a hurtful and hypocritical comment from someone who was leading her on. However, some might argue that her reaction was too harsh. But given the circumstances, her feelings are justified, so she's not the asshole here.\n"
