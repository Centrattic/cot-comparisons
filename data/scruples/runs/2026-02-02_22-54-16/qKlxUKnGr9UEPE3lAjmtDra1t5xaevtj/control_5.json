I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a person who's been in a flirty, almost dating relationship with a guy named Aaron. They've gone on dates, slept in the same bed, etc. Now, when the author wants to take things further, Aaron says he's only happy being friends and isn't into a relationship. He explains that he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author confronts him, and he confirms it's because she's fat. She gets upset and calls him a piece of shit, then starts spamming his Facebook with memes about body size. He blocks her after, and she feels half-bad but also justified.\n\nSo the question is whether she's the asshole. Let's break down both sides. \n\nFirst, Aaron's actions: He led her on by being flirty and engaging in date-like activities, which could be seen as leading her to believe there's a romantic future. Then, when she wants to take it further, he rejects her, using a comment that's clearly body-shaming. That's definitely on him. He's not handling the rejection well by being honest but in a hurtful way. Body-shaming is a problem here because it's a cruel way to end things, especially when you've been in a close relationship.\n\nNow the author's reaction: She's upset and angry, which is understandable. She confronts him, which is a valid response. Then she starts spamming his Facebook with memes that are critical of his comment. This could be seen as aggressive or hostile. However, she's reacting to a hurtful comment that made her feel devalued. Her response is emotional, but is it justified? Spamming someone with messages after they've blocked you might be crossing a line, but in this case, it's after he left and then came back to tell her she's the asshole.\n\nIs her retaliation excessive? Maybe. But considering Aaron's body-shaming comment, which is a serious issue, her reaction might be seen as a justified expression of anger towards someone who's hurt her. However, spamming with memes on social media could be seen as public shaming, which isn't great. But given the context, the main wrong here seems to be Aaron's initial rejection and body-shaming.\n\nThe key points: Aaron led her on and then used a cruel reason for rejecting her. The author's response is emotional but perhaps not the healthiest. However, the main issue is Aaron's behavior. So, is she the asshole? Probably not. He was the one who made the hurtful comment and led her on. She's standing up for herself, even if her method isn't ideal. So the answer would be B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
