I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and a guy named Aaron have been in a flirty, almost dating relationship for a few months. They've gone on dates, slept in the same bed, etc. The author thought they were moving towards a real relationship, but Aaron said he's happy just being friends. The author wanted more, and Aaron ended up saying he's not into girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author confronted him, and he admitted it was about her weight. She then called him out, sent him memes about body size, and he blocked her, calling her an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. Aaron led the author on by engaging in flirty behavior and doing things that typically suggest a more serious relationship (dates, sleeping together). That could be seen as leading someone on, which is a problem. The author felt betrayed when Aaron said he wasn't attracted to her because she's fat. The author's reaction was to confront him and send memes, which might be seen as aggressive or hurtful. Aaron then blocked her and accused her of making him feel bad about his desires.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if Aaron was leading her on, the author might not be wrong for feeling hurt and wanting to express that. However, responding with spamming and memes could be seen as excessive. On the other hand, Aaron's initial behavior of leading her on and then using her body size as an excuse for not wanting to pursue a relationship is questionable. He's making a judgment based on her appearance, which is a problem. The author's response was to call him out for that, which is understandable. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for making Aaron feel like shit. If Aaron's comment was hurtful and the author was defending herself, maybe she's not in the wrong. However, if her retaliation was too harsh, that could be where she's at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are: leading on, making a judgment about her body, and the author's response. If Aaron was leading her on, then the author isn't entirely at fault for being upset. But if her response was overly harsh (spamming, harsh memes), that's where she might be wrong. Alternatively, if Aaron's comment was a deal-breaker and the author was justified in confronting him, then she's not in the wrong. The question is whether her reaction was appropriate. Making someone feel like shit for their bias could be justified, but the method might be questionable. \n\nI think the main issue is Aaron leading her on and then being honest with a hurtful comment. The author's response, while perhaps harsh, was a reaction to being led on and then insulted. So, the author might not be in the wrong. But if the memes and spamming were excessive, maybe she is. It's a bit of a balance. The answer might be B (No), because Aaron's actions were problematic, and the author was defending herself against his bias. However, the aggression in her response could be seen as wrong. Hmm. It's a tough call. In AITA situations, the community often looks at whether the person's actions were reasonable given the context. If the author was being led on and then confronted Aaron for his comment, that's understandable. But the way she handled it (spaming with memes) might be seen as over the top. So maybe the author is partially at fault. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. The answer might be A (Yes) if her actions were too harsh, or B (No) if she's justified. Given that, I think the answer is B (No), because Aaron led her on and made a hurtful comment, so the author's reaction, while perhaps a bit confrontational, is a valid response to being treated poorly.\n"
