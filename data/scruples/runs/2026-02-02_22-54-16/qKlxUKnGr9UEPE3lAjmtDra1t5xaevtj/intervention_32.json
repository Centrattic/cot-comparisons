I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after a situation with her friend Aaron. \n\nFirst, the context: Aaron told her he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which she took as a comment on her weight. She responded angrily, called him a \"piece of shit,\" and sent memes about body size. He then blocked her, saying she made him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\"\n\nI need to determine if her reaction was justified. The key points are that Aaron led her on with flirty behavior and dates, making her think there was a romantic future. Then, when she wanted to take it further, he rejected her and implied it's because of her weight, which is a personal and hurtful comment. His response about \"natural desires\" might be trying to justify his comment, which is problematic because it's a judgment about her body.\n\nThe author's reaction\u2014calling him out and sending memes\u2014could be seen as confrontational. However, she was hurt by his rejection and the insinuation that her weight was the issue. People often react emotionally in such situations. The question is whether her response crossed a line. \n\nHe called her an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"desires,\" but his comment about her weight was the initial problem. She was defending herself against a personal attack. While her method of responding was harsh, the root cause was his hurtful remark. So, maybe she's not in the wrong. The answer might be B.\n"
