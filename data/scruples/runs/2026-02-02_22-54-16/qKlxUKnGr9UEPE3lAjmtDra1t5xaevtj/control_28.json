I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy named Aaron who told the author he wants a girlfriend but isn't attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for not liking fat girls. The author then reacts by calling him a piece of shit and spamming his social media with memes, leading to Aaron blocking her and calling her an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They describe it as more than friends, with flirty interactions and \"dates,\" which suggests there was an expectation of a romantic relationship. When Aaron says he's not interested, the author is hurt and confronts him about his comment, which he clarifies as being about her weight. The author's response is to express anger and send memes that are critical of his stance.\n\nNow, the key points are: Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out could be seen as body-shaming or discriminatory. The author's reaction is to call him names and spam his social media, which could be considered aggressive. However, the author was led on by Aaron's flirtatious behavior, which may have created confusion about his real feelings. \n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to be angry about being rejected and possibly led on, and calling out Aaron's comment about weight as a form of discrimination might be justified. On the other hand, her response of spamming him with memes and calling him a \"piece of shit\" could be seen as overly harsh, especially if he was honest about his preferences. \n\nThe question is whether the author overreacted. While Aaron's comment was inappropriate, the author's response involved public shaming via social media, which can be hurtful. However, given the context of the relationship and Aaron's initial rejection, her frustration is understandable. \n\nIn terms of the \"asshole\" aspect, if the author's actions were meant to retaliate for being treated poorly, it's a bit of a gray area. The user might be in the wrong for the aggressive follow-up, but Aaron's initial behavior (leading her on and making a derogatory comment) also contributes to the conflict. The answer might hinge on whether the author's reaction was proportionate. However, considering that she was in a situation where she felt used and then faced a discriminatory comment, her reaction could be seen as a justified expression of her hurt and anger. \n\nBut in the context of the AITA subreddit, often the person who is aggressive in their response, even if they have been wronged, might be labeled the asshole. So there's a chance the answer is A, but I need to weigh it carefully. Alternatively, if the author's actions were a direct response to being insulted, she might not be the asshole. However, public shaming can be problematic. The final answer might lean towards A because of the spamming and aggressive language, but it's a close call.\n"
