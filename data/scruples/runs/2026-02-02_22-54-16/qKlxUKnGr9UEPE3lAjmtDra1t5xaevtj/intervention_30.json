I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author had a close relationship with Aaron, which was very flirty and they did things that seem like dating. Then, when the author wanted to take it further, Aaron said he wasn't interested and hinted that it's because she's not into working out, which the author interprets as a code for being fat. The author got angry, called him a piece of shit, and then sent memes that were critical of his comment. Aaron said she made him feel like a shit for his \"natural desires,\" and the author is now unsure if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Aaron led her on with flirty behavior and dates, making her think they could be more. When she wanted a relationship, he rejected her by making a comment that could be seen as body-shaming. The author called him out and sent memes to express her feelings. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, Aaron expressed his attraction based on her not working out, which the author feels is a way to avoid saying he's not attracted to her because of her size. Body-shaming is generally considered hurtful and inappropriate. The author's reaction was to confront him and express her anger, which is a common response when someone feels rejected due to body issues. \n\nHowever, sending spam memes might be seen as aggressive or excessive, but it's a form of emotional expression. The key point is whether the author's actions were justified given Aaron's comment. Since Aaron made a personal and potentially hurtful remark, the author's response, while perhaps harsh, is a valid reaction to being made to feel bad about her body. \n\nOn the other hand, Aaron claims that his comment was about his \"natural desires,\" which some might argue is about personal preference. But using \"not working out\" as a euphemism for weight can be hurtful. The author's actions were in response to being led on and then rejected with a comment that could be seen as discriminatory. \n\nSo, considering that Aaron's comment was the trigger and the author was defending herself, the answer might be B (No). But I need to check if her response was unprovoked or if she overstepped. Since she was reacting to hurtful words, even if her response was harsh, she's in the right to express her feelings. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
