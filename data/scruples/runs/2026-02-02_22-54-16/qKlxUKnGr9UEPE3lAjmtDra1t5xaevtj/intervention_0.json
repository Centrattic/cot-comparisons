I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after a situation where a guy, Aaron, told her she's his ideal girlfriend but then said he isn't attracted to girls who don't work out, which she interprets as a code for fat girls. She confronted him, he admitted it was about her weight, she called him out, and then she spammed him with memes. He called her an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires,\" and she's wondering if she's the one in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Aaron led her on by being flirty and having a relationship that felt romantic, going on dates, sleeping in the same bed, etc. Then, when she wanted to take it further, he backed out and gave a reason that's clearly about her body size. That's pretty hurtful and could be seen as leading her on. His comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is a problematic way to express attraction based on weight, which can be discriminatory. \n\nThe author's reaction was to express her frustration and call him out, which is understandable given the situation. Spamming him with memes might be seen as aggressive, but it's a response to being hurt. However, when he retaliated and called her an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires,\" that's where it gets tricky. Is it the author's fault for calling him out on his harmful comment?\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, Aaron's behavior was leading her on and making a derogatory comment about her body. The author's reaction was in response to being hurt and feeling misled. While spamming him might not be the best approach, the core issue is Aaron's behavior. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself after being treated poorly. The answer is likely B (No), because Aaron's actions were more harmful, and the author had the right to express her feelings, even if the method was a bit harsh. The main issue is Aaron's insensitivity and leading her on.\n"
