I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after a situation where their friend, Aaron, led them on and then made a derogatory comment about their body. The user says they told Aaron they were his ideal girlfriend, but then he said he wasn't attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author took as a code for fat girls. The author confronted him, leading to a conflict where they both insulted each other.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics of the relationship. The author describes it as more than friends with flirty behavior and dates, which suggests Aaron might have been giving mixed signals. When the author wanted to take it further, Aaron said he was happy just being friends, which could be leading her on. Then he makes a comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as fat-shaming. She confronts him, he doesn't back down, and they both end up insulting each other.\n\nThe key points here are: leading someone on, making a body-shaming comment, and the subsequent conflict. The author's response was to call him a piece of shit and spam him with memes. Aaron then blocks her after calling her an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\" \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, making derogatory comments about someone's body is clearly wrong. Body-shaming is harmful and disrespectful. The author was within her rights to feel hurt and to confront Aaron. However, the author's response was to spam him with offensive memes. While she had every right to be upset, the aggressive follow-up might be seen as escalating the conflict unnecessarily. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, she was a victim of being led on and then body-shamed. On the other hand, her response was to\u8fb1\u9a82 and spam, which isn't ideal. The user is torn between feeling her actions were justified and feeling bad about her behavior.\n\nAccording to the standard of \"Am I the Asshole,\" the focus is on who is at fault. The main issue here is Aaron's behavior: leading her on and making a derogatory comment. The author's response, while not perfect, was a reaction to being mistreated. The initial harm came from Aaron. The author's actions might be impulsive but not necessarily morally wrong given the context. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the primary fault lies with Aaron's actions of leading her on and body-shaming. The author's response, while perhaps heated, is a reaction to being wronged.\n"
