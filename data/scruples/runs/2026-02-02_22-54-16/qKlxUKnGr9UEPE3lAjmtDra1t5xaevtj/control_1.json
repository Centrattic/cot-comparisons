I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy named Aaron who has been leading the author on with flirtatious behavior and casual dates. When the author wants to take it to the next level, Aaron says he's happy just being friends. The author pushes further and Aaron then reveals he's not into girls who don't work out, implying that the author is fat. The author confronts this, calls Aaron a \"piece of shit,\" and spams him with memes. Aaron then blocks her, calling her an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\" The author is conflicted but feels she did what needed to be done.\n\nFirst, I need to assess who is at fault here. The user wants to know if the author is wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nLooking at Aaron's actions: He engaged in a flirtatious, almost romantic relationship with the author, including dates and sleeping in the same bed. When the author wants to move forward, he rejects her but in a way that's hurtful and discriminatory. He uses a vague comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author correctly interprets as a fat-shaming remark. His response is dismissive and harmful, and he later blocks her after she confronts him.\n\nThe author's response: She's hurt and angry. She confronts Aaron directly about his comment, which he confirms. She expresses her feelings by calling him names and sending memes, which might be seen as aggressive. However, her reaction is a direct response to being insulted and dismissed. The memes she sends are about body positivity, which is a valid response to fat-shaming.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. Aaron's behavior is definitely problematic. He led her on, then rejected her with a discriminatory remark. The author had every right to be upset. However, her response of spamming him with memes and calling him names could be seen as hostile. But given that he was the one who made a derogatory comment about her body, her reaction is a justified expression of her hurt and anger. The key point is that Aaron's comment was the catalyst. If the author had responded calmly, maybe, but in this context, her emotional response is understandable. The line between being assertive and being an asshole is blurry here. Since Aaron's actions were the root of the problem, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. She had the right to defend herself against his fat-shaming. Her reaction, while perhaps a bit over the top, is a response to being treated poorly. The fact that Aaron called her an asshole for making him feel bad for his \"natural desires\" highlights his defensiveness and refusal to take responsibility. So, the author's actions stem from being hurt and wanting to confront the issue, which is reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
