I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend, Aaron, who the author was in a flirty, dating-like relationship with. The author wanted to take things further, but Aaron declined, saying he's not into girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a comment on her weight. The author then confronts him, calls him a piece of shit, and spams his social media with memes related to body positivity. Aaron responds by saying she made him feel like a shit for his \"natural desires,\" and the author is conflicted about whether she was right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral aspects here. Aaron led the author on with flirty behavior and dates, which could be seen as leading someone on, making the author believe there was a chance for a relationship. When he finally breaks it off, he uses a comment that the author takes as derogatory about her weight. That's a clear issue. Using \"code\" for fat shaming is problematic, regardless of his intent. The author's reaction is emotional\u2014calling him names, spamming social media with memes. While that's not the healthiest way to handle a breakup, it's a reaction to being hurt and feeling disrespected.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, responding with aggressive messages and memes could be seen as over the top. People often say things in anger that they regret, and it's possible that Aaron was just expressing his preferences, even if it was hurtful. However, the key points are that Aaron led the author on, then made a comment that she felt was about her weight. The author's response, while perhaps not the best approach, was a reaction to being hurt and potentially fat-shamed. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the wrong is more on Aaron for leading her on and making a potentially hurtful comment. The author's actions are a reaction to that. While the author's response might be impulsive, it's important to consider the context of feeling disrespected and the emotional state. So, the author might not be in the wrong, but she could have handled it differently. The main issue is Aaron's behavior, not necessarily the author's response. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
