I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (AITA). The situation involves a friend, Aaron, who leads the author on with flirtatious behavior and dates, then when the author wants a serious relationship, he backs out and makes a comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a reference to her weight.\n\nFirst, Aaron's actions: he's been in a flirty, date-like relationship with the author for months. When she wants to take it further, he says he's happy being friends and gives a vague reason. The author presses him, and he says he's not into girls who don't work out, which she takes as a comment on her size. That's a clear instance of leading someone on and then making a hurtful comment based on her body. That's not just a \"natural desire\" but a form of body shaming, which is inappropriate and disrespectful.\n\nThe author's response: she calls him out, tells him he's a piece of crap, and spams him with memes. Then, when he blocks her, he claims she made him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\" The author feels conflicted but believes she did what needed to be done. \n\nNow, the key points here. Aaron led her on, so he's at fault for creating expectations and then pulling back with a discriminatory comment. The author's reaction, while maybe harsh in the spamming part, is a response to being hurt and dismissed. She called him out on his behavior, which is valid. However, spamming him with memes might be considered over the top, even if it's in response to hurt. But the initial issue is Aaron's inconsiderate and discriminatory remarks. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself after being mistreated. The main wrongdoer here is Aaron. The author's actions, while possibly excessive in the follow-up, are a reaction to being led on and body-shamed. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
