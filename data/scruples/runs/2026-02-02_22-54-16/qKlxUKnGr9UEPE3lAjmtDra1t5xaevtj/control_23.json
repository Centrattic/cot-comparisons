I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend (Aaron) who made a pass at the author, called them his \"ideal girlfriend,\" but then said he's not into girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as code for fat girls. The author was led on, felt used, and then after Aaron rejected her and gave that reason, she confronted him and sent memes that were critical of him. Now Aaron says he felt like she made him feel like a bad person for his preferences.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and Aaron were in a flirty, almost romantic situation. The author wanted to take it further, but Aaron didn't. He gave a reason that seems to target the author's body size, which is hurtful. The author, feeling hurt and used, responded by calling him out and sending memes that mocked his statement. Aaron then said she made him feel like an asshole for his \"natural desires.\"\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out (implying fat girls) is clearly discriminatory. The author had every right to be upset and to call him out for his insensitivity. Sending memes might be seen as harsh, but it's a form of self-expression in response to being hurt. On the other hand, if the author's response escalated the situation and made Aaron feel targeted for his personal preferences, even if they were offensive, there's a question of whether she overstepped. However, given that Aaron made a derogatory comment, the author's reaction is a valid emotional response.\n\nAlso, Aaron admitted to leading her on by saying they're \"more than friends\" and then rejecting her. That's a form of emotional manipulation. The author's actions are a reaction to being mistreated. The key here is that the initial offense was Aaron's, and the author's response, while maybe harsh, is a reaction to his behavior. People do have a right to express their hurt and to call out offensive comments, even if it makes the other person uncomfortable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
