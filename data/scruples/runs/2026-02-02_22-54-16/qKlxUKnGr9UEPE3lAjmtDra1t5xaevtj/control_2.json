I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA question) is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a close, flirty relationship with Aaron, which they consider more than friends. They tried to take things further, but Aaron said he was only into friendship. Then, he mentioned that he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author confronts him, he admits it's about her weight, and she gets angry, calls him a piece of shit, and spams him with memes. He blocks her, saying she's an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nSo, the key points here. The author felt led on because Aaron was being flirty and they had a close relationship. When pushed for a commitment, Aaron dismissed her feelings and made a comment about her weight. The author's response was to express anger, confront him, and then spam him with memes. \n\nNow, evaluating if the author is wrong. Let's consider both sides. \n\nFrom the author's perspective: They had a relationship they considered more than friends, and Aaron led them on. When they tried to clarify, he gave a hurtful response that was a backhanded rejection. The author's reaction was to confront him and then express their anger publicly. This might be seen as justified because Aaron's comment was hurtful and dismissive. The author is standing up for themselves after being rejected on a personal attack.\n\nFrom Aaron's perspective: He ended the relationship, stating that he's not interested in a romantic relationship. He might feel that the author is being aggressive in their public shaming, especially if he felt his right to his personal preferences (even if they're problematic) was being attacked. He says the author made him feel bad for his \"natural desires,\" which could imply he feels his preferences are being judged.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. Was the author wrong? Let's think about the dynamics. First, Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is problematic. It's a harmful stereotype and a way of rejecting someone based on their body, which is not acceptable. The author is correct in pointing out that it's about weight.\n\nHowever, the author's response\u2014publicly shaming him with memes and calling him a piece of shit\u2014might be seen as aggressive. While it's understandable to be upset, using public shaming could be considered an overreaction, especially if Aaron had already stated his position and was trying to be honest (albeit in a hurtful way). The author's spamming of his Facebook could be seen as harassment, which is inconsiderate.\n\nBut then again, Aaron led the author on with flirtatious behavior, creating the expectation of a romantic relationship. When the author tried to move forward, he dismissed them and used a body-shaming comment. This led to the author feeling rejected and hurt. In that context, their anger is a natural response to being treated disrespectfully.\n\nThe key question here is whether the author's reaction is proportionate. Publicly shaming someone for a hurtful rejection might not be the best approach, but the root issue is Aaron's problematic comment. The author is standing up for themselves against a personal attack, which is not wrong. The problem is Aaron's initial behavior, but the author's response, while maybe harsh, is a reaction to being hurt.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on who is more in the wrong. Here, the main issue is Aaron's comment about the author's weight. The author's reaction is a defense against that, so they are not the asshole. The author is justified in being upset and expressing their anger, even if the method was aggressive. The public shaming is a separate issue, but the primary wrong was on Aaron's side. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
