I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a friend, Aaron, who led the author on with flirty behavior and dates, then rejected her after she wanted to take things further. He mentioned he's not into girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a dig at her weight. She reacts by calling him a piece of shit and spamming his Facebook with memes. He then calls her an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nFirst, Aaron led her on by giving mixed signals. They were in a situation that felt romantic, so his rejection after building that up is a problem. He was the one who caused hurt by making a comment about her body, which is a sensitive topic. The author's reaction is emotional, but he did make a derogatory remark about her weight. She called him out on it, which is understandable. The question is whether her response was wrong. She sent memes that were related to body acceptance, which could be seen as a reasonable way to express her hurt, especially since he was the one who brought up the issue. However, spamming him with memes might be considered aggressive. But considering the context, she was responding to a hurtful comment. He then accused her of making him feel bad, which is a bit of a flip since he was the one who made the negative remark. The author does feel some guilt, which might indicate she's being fair. So, while her response could be seen as harsh, the root issue is Aaron's comment about her weight. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
