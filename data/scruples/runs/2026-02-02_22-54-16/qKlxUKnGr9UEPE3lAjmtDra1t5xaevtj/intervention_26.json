I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a person (the author) who had a complicated relationship with their friend Aaron. They were flirting, going on dates, sleeping in the same bed, so it seems like they were in a close, possibly romantic relationship. Then Aaron ends things, saying he's not into relationships and not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a comment on weight. The author confronts him, gets angry, and starts spamming him with memes. Aaron then blocks the author and accuses them of making him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\" The author is conflicted, feeling partly bad but also justified.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, Aaron's actions: He was in a situation where he was leading the author on by being flirty, going on dates, etc., which could be seen as giving mixed signals. When the author wants to take it further, he says he's not interested, then makes a comment about the author's weight. That's pretty hurtful. Making a comment about someone's size in a context where they're trying to end things could be seen as a harsh or insensitivity.\n\nThen the author's response: They get angry, call Aaron a \"piece of shit,\" and start spamming him with memes. The author is clearly hurt and wants to express their frustration. The memes are about body shaming, which is a valid issue. However, spamming someone with messages, even if they're memes, can come off as aggressive or harassing. The author's response might be justified in feeling wronged, but the method of response might be questionable.\n\nNow, Aaron blocking the author and calling them an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires\" is another point. It's important to consider that Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is essentially body shaming. If Aaron is making a judgment based on the author's weight, that's on him. However, the author's reaction of calling him out and spamming could escalate the situation.\n\nThe key factors here are consent and communication. If Aaron was leading the author on, that's his fault. If he made a derogatory comment about the author's body, that's also his fault. The author's reaction, while perhaps impulsive, is a response to being hurt and feeling used. However, the method of response (spamming) might cross a line, even if the initial comment was wrong.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling hurt and wanting to express that. The problem is more with Aaron's actions in leading on and making a judgmental comment. The author's response, while maybe not the most mature, is a reaction to being wronged. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for reacting that way. If the author was justified in their anger, then their actions (even if harsh) might not make them the asshole. However, if the author's response was excessive, that could be a point against them.\n\nBut considering the context\u2014being in a situation where someone is being led on and then insulted for their body weight, the author's anger seems justified. The spamming could be seen as a form of retaliation, which isn't great, but given the context, it's a reaction to a harmful comment. So, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The main fault lies with Aaron for the body shaming and leading on. The author's actions are a reaction to that, so the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong)."
