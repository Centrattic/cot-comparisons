I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after a situation where their friend Aaron ended things because he wasn't attracted to girls who don't work out, implying the author is fat. The author then called Aaron a \"piece of shit\" and spammed him with memes, leading to Aaron saying the author made him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\"\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The author and Aaron had a flirty, almost romantic relationship. Aaron led them on with dates and sleeping in the same bed but then rejected them, giving a reason that's clearly about the author's weight. That's pretty harsh and could be considered body-shaming. The author was hurt and expressed anger appropriately. Then, Aaron criticized the author for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires,\" which might be an attempt to deflect or justify his own behavior.\n\nThe key points here are: Aaron ended the relationship by using a hurtful comment about the author's weight, which is a form of discrimination. The author responded with frustration and anger, which is understandable given the situation. However, the author continued to spam Aaron with memes, which might be seen as crossing a line. But given the initial hurt and the context of being led on, the author's reaction is more about standing up for themselves after being disrespected.\n\nSo, while the author's response might have been harsh, the root cause was Aaron's disrespectful comment. The author felt led on and then criticized for their size, which is not acceptable. Therefore, it's not clear-cut that the author is in the wrong. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but there's a bit of nuance. However, the author's actions in spamming might be seen as overreacting, but given the context, it's a justified response to being mistreated.\n"
