I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about a friend, Aaron, who told the author he considers her his \"ideal girlfriend\" but then says he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author feels led on because their interactions have been flirty and date-like. When the author pushes for a relationship, Aaron backs out, says he's not into girls who don't work out, and the author confronts him, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author is upset because Aaron gave mixed signals. He had a flirty friendship with dates and sleeping together, which the author saw as moving towards a relationship. When the author wanted to take it further, Aaron pulled back and gave a comment that the author took as fat-shaming. The author then called him out and sent memes about body size, leading to the argument where Aaron says the author made him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\"\n\nThe key points here are about leading someone on versus being honest. If Aaron's actions (dates, sleeping together) led the author to believe they were in a relationship, then Aaron might be at fault for not being clear. However, the author's response was to call Aaron out and send memes, which could be seen as aggressive or hurtful. The author's main grievance is that Aaron used a fat-shaming comment to end things, which is definitely problematic.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, fat-shaming is a serious issue and should not be justified as a \"natural desire.\" If Aaron made a derogatory comment about the author's body, he's in the wrong. The author's reaction, while perhaps harsh in method, stems from being hurt and feeling disrespected. However, the author could have handled it differently, but the core issue is Aaron's comment about body size.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself against fat-shaming. The problem lies with Aaron's discriminatory remark. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
