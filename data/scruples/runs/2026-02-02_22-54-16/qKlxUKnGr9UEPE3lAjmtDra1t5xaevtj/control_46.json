I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author had a close, flirty relationship with this guy named Aaron. They went on dates and slept together, which the author thought might lead to a more formal relationship. But Aaron said he's not interested in a relationship and then made a comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author took as a veiled insult about her weight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. From Aaron's perspective, he might have been trying to be honest about his preferences. However, the way he phrased it could be seen as offensive or insensitive, especially if it's a backhanded way of saying the author is fat. The author then responded with anger and sent a lot of memes that were clearly about body shaming, which might be seen as retaliating. \n\nThe key points here are whether Aaron's comment was a legitimate preference or a hurtful way to reject someone. If he was being honest but in a way that was cruel, then the author's reaction might be justified. But if the author's response was overly harsh, like spamming social media with memes that mock his stance, that could be problematic. \n\nAlso, the author felt led on by Aaron's behavior, which suggests that Aaron's actions might have contributed to the confusion. The author was hurt and wanted clarity, which is understandable. However, responding with aggressive messages after being rejected might not be the best approach. \n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped by making Aaron feel bad for his \"natural desires.\" If Aaron was just being honest about his preferences, even if it's not politically correct, the author's reaction could be seen as harsh. But if Aaron was being rude or using a coded insult, then the author has a right to be upset. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally considered offensive to comment on someone's weight in a rejection. So Aaron might have been in the wrong for making that comment. However, the author's response of spamming him with memes and then calling him a \"piece of shit\" could be seen as aggressive. \n\nSo balancing both sides, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but their response could have been more constructive. The key is whether the author's actions were proportionate to the hurt they felt. If Aaron was cruel in his rejection, the author's reaction is understandable. But if Aaron was just being honest, the author might have overreacted. \n\nIn conclusion, considering that Aaron used a coded insult about body image, which is a sensitive issue, the author's frustration is valid. However, the way they responded (spamming, insults) might not be the healthiest approach. But given that Aaron's comment was inappropriate, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. So the answer is B (No).\n"
