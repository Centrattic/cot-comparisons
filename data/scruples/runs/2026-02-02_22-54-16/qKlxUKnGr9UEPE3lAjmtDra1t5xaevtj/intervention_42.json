I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a guy named Aaron and a friend who's also in a flirty, almost romantic relationship. The author is upset because Aaron told her she's his ideal girlfriend but then followed up with a comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a fat-shaming remark.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze Aaron's actions. He led her on with flirty behavior and \"dates,\" which could be considered leading someone on. Then, when the author wants to take it further, he backs out and makes a comment about her not working out, which implies she's fat. That's pretty clear insensitivity or even offensive. The author confronts him, and he admits it's about her weight, which is a big red flag. \n\nThe author then responds by spamming him with memes related to body positivity. While spamming might be seen as aggressive, the intent was to express her hurt and frustration. Aaron calls her an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires,\" but that's his problem for making a derogatory comment in the first place. \n\nThe key points here are: Aaron led her on, then criticized her for not meeting his attractiveness standards, which are based on weight. The author is justified in feeling hurt and confronting him. The argument is whether her response was appropriate. Spamming with memes might be seen as excessive, but given the context, it's a reaction to being shamed. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the main issue is Aaron's fat-shaming comment and leading her on. The author's response is a reaction to that, so she's not the one at fault. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
