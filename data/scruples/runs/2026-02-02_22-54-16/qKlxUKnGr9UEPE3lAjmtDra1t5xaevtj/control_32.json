I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend who led the author on, being flirty and having a close relationship, then suddenly rejecting her because she's not into working out, which the author interprets as a code for fat shaming. The author then confronts him, gets angry, and starts spamming him with memes, leading the friend to block her and call her an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nHmm, first, I need to assess both sides. The author felt led on because there were signs of a romantic relationship, like going on dates and sleeping in the same bed. When she wanted to take it further, he rejected her by saying he's not into girls who don't work out, which she sees as fat-shaming. She confronted him, and her reactions included calling him a \"piece of shit,\" then spamming his Facebook with memes. He blocked her, saying she made him feel bad for his natural desires.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, she did get angry and retaliated with spamming, which is probably not the best approach. However, being called fat and rejected because of weight is a serious issue. He used a code phrase that targets her body image, which is hurtful. Her reaction might be over the top, but she was hurt. On the other hand, he might feel that his honest opinion about his preferences is valid, but he could have handled the rejection more sensitively. \n\nThe question is whether her actions (calling him names, spamming) make her the asshole. The key points are: was he leading her on? If he intended to be just friends but was being flirty, maybe he's partly at fault. But when she confronted him about being fat, he confirmed that's what he meant, which is problematic. The author's anger is justified given that he rejected her based on her body, which is a form of discrimination. However, her response of spamming and aggressive comments might be seen as disproportionate. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. He's in the wrong for rejecting her based on her weight and leading her on, but she could have handled the situation better instead of attacking him. However, the question is specifically about the author's actions. If she was justified in feeling hurt and her response was a reaction to being fat-shamed, then she's not entirely wrong. But her method of response (spamming with memes) might make her seem aggressive. \n\nThe Reddit-style AITA (Am I the Asshole) often looks at intentions and actions. The author's main issue was being fat-shamed, which is a valid reason to be upset. However, her response was harsh. So maybe the answer is B because she's not in the wrong for standing up for herself, even if her method was a bit extreme. Alternatively, maybe A because her actions were mean. But given that the core issue is him rejecting her based on her body, it's more about his wrongdoings. The author's actions are a reaction to that, so she's not the asshole. So the answer would be B.\n"
