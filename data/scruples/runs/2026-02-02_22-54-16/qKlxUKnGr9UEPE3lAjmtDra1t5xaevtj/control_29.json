I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author had a friend named Aaron, and their relationship was pretty flirty and included dates and sleeping in the same bed. Then Aaron said he wasn't into a relationship and mentioned he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author confronts him, they get into an argument, and the author sends memes that are critical of Aaron's comments. Aaron blocks the author and says they're an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\" The author is confused about whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author felt Aaron was leading them on by being flirty and suggesting a deeper relationship but then rejecting them based on their body size. The author's response was to call Aaron out and send memes that mock his stance, which led to being blocked. The key points here are about consent, respect, and the nature of the relationship.\n\nIf Aaron was leading the author on by giving mixed signals, then the author might have a valid point in feeling hurt and trying to address it. However, the author's response was to spam Aaron with memes that could be seen as attacking his personal views, even if those views are hurtful. The author might think it's justified because Aaron was rude about their body, but public shaming or harassment (even if it's memes) can be problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, if Aaron was honest about not being attracted to the author, maybe the author overreacted. But Aaron's comment about girls who don't work out implying fat girls is clearly body-shaming, which is not okay. The author has a right to be upset about that. However, the way the author handled it\u2014spamming and using memes\u2014might have crossed a line into making Aaron feel attacked, even if the content of the memes was about valid issues.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for being hurt and confronting Aaron about the body-shaming comment. But the method of response (spamming and public shaming) could be seen as the issue. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main problem here is Aaron's comment about body size, which is a valid reason for the author's reaction. The author's actions, while possibly not the most mature way to handle it, stem from being hurt by a friend who led them on and then made a derogatory comment. So, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they were responding to being mistreated. But there's a nuance that the author's response might not be appropriate either. However, given the context of being led on and then insulted, the author's anger is justified, so they aren't the asshole here.\n"
