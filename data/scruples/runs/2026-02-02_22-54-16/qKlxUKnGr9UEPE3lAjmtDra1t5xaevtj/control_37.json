I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong after their conversation with Aaron. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and Aaron have been flirting a lot, going on dates, even sleeping in the same bed. The author thought they were more than friends. Then, when they tried to take things further, Aaron said he wasn't interested in a relationship. He explained that he wasn't attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author confronts him, and Aaron admits it's about her weight. The author gets angry, calls Aaron a piece of shit, and then spams him with memes about body size. Aaron responds by saying she's an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nSo, the key points here are about consent and honesty in relationships. Aaron led the author on by being flirty and engaging in activities that could be interpreted as dating, which might have given the author the impression that a relationship was possible. When the author expressed wanting to take things further, Aaron's refusal based on her weight seems like a rejection rooted in superficial reasons, which could be hurtful.\n\nThe author's reaction\u2014calling Aaron names and spamming him with memes\u2014could be seen as aggressive. However, considering that Aaron's comment about weight was a direct insult, the author's anger is understandable. The memes are a form of expressing their hurt and anger, but spamming someone might be excessive. However, given the context of being made to feel unworthy, maybe it's a justified reaction.\n\nOn the other hand, Aaron's justification for not wanting to date the author because of her weight is problematic. Weight is a personal attribute, and while people have preferences, it's a superficial basis for rejecting someone, especially after leading them on. Also, calling the author fat directly might be a form of body shaming, which is hurtful.\n\nNow, the author is being criticized for making Aaron feel bad about his \"natural desires.\" But if Aaron's desires are based on discriminatory views (i.e., not being attracted to a certain body type unless they meet his standards), the author isn't wrong for holding him accountable. However, the author's response might be harsh, but it's a reaction to being rejected in a hurtful way after being led on.\n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong: Aaron initiated the flirty behavior and then rejected the author based on a superficial trait. The author's anger is a reaction to being treated poorly. However, their method of expressing that anger (spamming) might be excessive, but it's a common reaction when hurt. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer hinges on the author's actions, then maybe A (yes) because spamming could be seen as harassment. But if the focus is on Aaron's hypocrisy and the author's right to be upset, then B (no).\n\nI think the answer is B because Aaron's behavior was questionable\u2014he led the author on and then rejected her based on weight, which is a form of body shaming. The author's reaction, while maybe over the top, is understandable in that context. So the author isn't in the wrong; the problem is more with Aaron's actions.\n"
