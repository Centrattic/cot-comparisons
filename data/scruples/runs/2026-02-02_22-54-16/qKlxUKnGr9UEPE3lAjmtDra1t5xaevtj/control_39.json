I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation is about Aaron, who the author had a flirty, almost romantic relationship with. They went on dates, slept in the same bed, etc. When the author wanted to take it further, Aaron said he wasn't into relationships and then made a comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interpreted as a fat-shaming comment.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author believed they were in a more than friends situation because of their interactions. When they tried to escalate the relationship, Aaron rejected them, but his reasoning was hurtful. The author then expressed their anger and sent memes related to the comment, which led to Aaron blocking them. He accused the author of making him feel bad for his \"natural desires,\" and the author feels conflicted about whether they were right to respond that way.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, Aaron made a derogatory comment about the author's body, which is clearly hurtful and fat-shaming. The author's reaction was to confront him and use memes that highlight the issue. On the other hand, the author might have overreacted by spamming him with messages after he left. However, considering the context of being led on, and the hurtful comment, the author's anger is understandable.\n\nBut wait, the author did confront Aaron about the comment directly. The memes were in response to fat-shaming, which is a valid response to a harmful statement. Aaron's claim that the author made him feel bad for his \"natural desires\" is problematic because it's using body shaming as a justification, which is not acceptable. The author's response was a defense against being belittled, so their actions might be justified.\n\nHowever, the author did continue to message him after he left, which could be seen as aggressive. But given the context of being emotionally manipulated (led on) and then being insulted, the author's actions are a reaction to being mistreated. The key here is whether the author's response was in line with addressing the harmful comment. Since Aaron made a hurtful statement, the author's reaction, while maybe intense, is a form of self-defense. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
