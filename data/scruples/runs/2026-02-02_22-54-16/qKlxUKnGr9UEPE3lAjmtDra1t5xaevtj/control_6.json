I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend, Aaron, who the author is in a flirty, almost romantic relationship with. They've been on dates and slept in the same bed, which the author considers more than just friends.\n\nSo, Aaron tells the author he's not interested in a relationship and then says he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, implying he finds the author fat. The author confronts him, and he admits it's about her weight. The author then lashes out, calls him a \"piece of shit,\" and starts spamming him with memes about body size. Aaron responds by saying she's a huge asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author was led on by Aaron, with flirty behavior and dates. When confronted about his rejection, Aaron makes a comment that's clearly body-shaming. The author's reaction is to call him out and spam him with memes, which is aggressive but a response to being hurt. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, Aaron's comment is clearly discriminatory. Body-shaming is not okay. The author was justified in being hurt and expressing that. However, the author's method of responding\u2014spamming his Facebook\u2014could be seen as harsh. But given the context, it's a reaction to being insulted. \n\nOn the other hand, Aaron's defense that his comment was about \"natural desires\" is problematic. It's not a valid reason to devalue someone. The author's anger stems from being led on and then criticized for her body. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The key issue is Aaron's body-shaming, which is the root problem. The author's actions, while maybe impulsive, are a reaction to being mistreated. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
