I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a friend, Aaron, who told the author he wants to be friends but not in a relationship. The author felt led on because their interactions were very flirty and they considered them dates. Then, when the author pushed for more, Aaron mentioned not being attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author took as a veiled comment about her being fat. The author responded angrily, called him a piece of shit, and started spamming him with memes. Aaron said the author made him feel like shit for his \"natural desires\" before blocking her. The author feels conflicted about whether she was right to respond the way she did.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. Aaron's actions: he had a romantic and flirtatious relationship with the author, which could be seen as leading her on. Then, when asked about taking it further, he gave a vague reason that turned into a comment about her body. That's a problem because he didn't clearly state his reasons upfront. The author felt hurt and angry because he didn't respect her feelings and made a judgment about her body. Her response was to lash out, which might be understandable given the emotional situation, but perhaps not the healthiest way to handle it.\n\nThe key points here are about honesty and respect in relationships. If Aaron led her on by being flirty and having dates without being clear about his intentions, he shares some responsibility. The author's anger is justified if she felt manipulated. However, responding with spamming and harsh words could be seen as overreacting, even if she was hurt. The question is whether her reaction crossed the line.\n\nThe user is asking if she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering that Aaron gave a hurtful comment about her body and didn't communicate clearly, the author's anger is understandable. But her response of spamming and calling him names might be seen as unkind, even if she was wronged. However, the initial problem was Aaron's behavior. The author's actions were a reaction to being hurt, so while not ideal, it's debatable whether she's the one in the wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because Aaron's actions were the root issue, and the author's response, while poor, was a reaction to being mistreated.\n"
