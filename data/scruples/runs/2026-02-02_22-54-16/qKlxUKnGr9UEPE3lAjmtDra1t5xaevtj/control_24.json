I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and Aaron have been in a flirty, almost romantic relationship. They've gone on dates and slept together. Then, when the author wants to take it further, Aaron says he's not interested and comments that he's not into girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as being fat-shamed. The author gets angry, calls Aaron a jerk, and spams him with memes. Aaron responds by saying she's an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nSo, the main points here: Aaron led the author on with physical and emotional intimacy, then rejected her by making a comment about her weight. The author then publicly shamed him, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, determining fault. Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is clearly discriminatory and hurtful. He's being hypocritical because he's been in a close relationship with her. The author's reaction is understandable frustration. However, publicly shaming him with memes might be excessive, but the initial problem lies with Aaron's fat-shaming. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author did confront Aaron about the comment and expressed her feelings, which is valid. Her follow-up actions (spamming with memes) might be seen as over the top, but the root issue is Aaron's behavior. So, while the author might have overreacted in her response, Aaron's initial comment was the main issue. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she was defending herself against a hurtful comment, maybe she isn't the asshole here. But public shaming could be problematic. \n\nHmm. In AITA scenarios, often the person who makes the discriminatory comment is the one in the wrong. The author was defending herself against a personal attack. Her reaction is emotional but not entirely unjustified. However, the spamming might not be the best approach. But the main issue is Aaron's fat-shaming. So, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the fault lies with Aaron for making the discriminatory comment. The author had the right to feel hurt and respond, even if her method was harsh.\n"
