I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after a situation where a friend, Aaron, made a comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interpreted as a dig at her weight. They had a flirty, almost dating relationship, and when the author wanted to take it further, Aaron rejected her, citing this reason. The author then called him out, blocked him, and sent memes, leading Aaron to say she made him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author felt led on by Aaron's actions, which were flirtatious and included dates. Then, when she wanted a real relationship, he rejected her based on her body type. That's hurtful and could be seen as disrespectful. The author's reaction\u2014using memes and blocking him\u2014might be seen as justified given the emotional manipulation. But when Aaron felt criticized for his preferences, he accused her of making him feel bad about his \"natural desires,\" implying he's just being honest. \n\nHowever, making someone feel bad for having discriminatory preferences is not necessarily wrong. It's important to hold people accountable for hurtful comments, especially when they're based on body shaming. The author was defending herself against a derogatory remark. On the other hand, maybe the author overreacted, but given the context of being led on and then rejected for her size, her response seems reasonable. Aaron's comment was about his personal preferences, but that doesn't make it okay to belittle someone for their body. So the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
