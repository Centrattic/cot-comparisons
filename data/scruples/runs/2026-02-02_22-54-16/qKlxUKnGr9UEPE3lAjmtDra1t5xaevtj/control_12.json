I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person in the \"AITA\" scenario) is in the wrong after an argument with her friend Aaron. The situation involves Aaron leading her on by flirting and going on dates, then rejecting her romantically by saying he's not into girls who don't work out, which she interprets as a comment on her weight. She confronts him, he confirms it, and she yells at him, leading to her spamming his social media with memes. He then tells her she's an asshole for making him feel bad for his \"natural desires,\" and she's conflicted about whether she was right.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The key points are:\n\n1. **Aaron's actions**: He led her on by engaging in flirty behavior, going on dates, sleeping in the same bed, etc., which can be seen as emotionally manipulative. Then, when rejecting her, he used a fat-shaming comment disguised as a preference for working out. That's clearly inappropriate and hurtful.\n\n2. **Author's reaction**: She called him out on the fat-shaming, which she rightly interpreted as a personal attack on her weight. Her reaction of yelling and spamming him with memes is aggressive, but she was hurt and angry. However, her actions did make him feel bad, which he now claims as his \"natural desires\" being criticized.\n\n3. **Ethical considerations**: Fat-shaming is a serious issue and is considered harmful and discriminatory. People should not be judged or rejected based on their weight. However, the author's response\u2014calling him a \"piece of shit\" and spamming him\u2014could be seen as excessive, even if justified by his hurtful comment. The line between standing up for oneself and crossing into harassment is thin here.\n\n4. **Context of the relationship**: The author felt Aaron led her on, creating emotional investment before rejecting her. This emotional manipulation can exacerbate the hurt, making her reaction more understandable.\n\n5. **Public shaming via memes**: Using Facebook memes to confront him publicly might be seen as inappropriate, even if the content was a response to his fat-shaming. Public shaming can be counterproductive and hurtful, regardless of the situation.\n\nSo, while Aaron clearly made a hurtful and discriminatory comment, the author's response, though understandable, might be seen as crossing the line into harassment. However, the initial fat-shaming is a major red flag, and the author had a right to be upset. The question is whether her reaction was proportionate. If the answer hinges on whether the author is in the wrong, considering both the fat-shaming and the subsequent actions, it's tricky. But in terms of the immediate question\u2014is the author in the wrong for making him feel bad? If his comment was based on her weight, then the author's reaction in calling him out is justified. However, the spamming and aggressive language might be considered over the top. But given that the fat-shaming is the root issue, which is a significant wrong, the author's actions in response could be seen as a justified defense of her self-worth. So maybe the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the fault lies with Aaron for the fat-shaming, not the author for defending herself.\n"
