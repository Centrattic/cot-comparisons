I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy named Aaron who told the author he's his ideal girlfriend but then said he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author then confronts him, gets hurt, and responds with some memes and messages. Aaron says the author made him feel like shit for his \"natural desires,\" and the author is conflicted about whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. Aaron led the author on by having a flirty, almost romantic relationship, going on dates and sleeping together, which could be seen as leading her on. Then, when the author wants to formalize the relationship, he backs out. He then tells her he's not into girls who don't work out, which the author takes as a subtle way of saying she's fat. That's pretty hurtful and could be seen as body-shaming. The author's response is to call him out, send memes about body size, and spam his social media. He then blocks her but says she made him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\"\n\nNow, considering the actions: Aaron's behavior is questionable because he led her on and then used a body-shaming comment to reject her. The author's response is to confront him, which is understandable given the hurt. However, spamming someone with memes might be considered over the line. The author might have a right to be angry and express that, but the method could be criticized. However, Aaron's initial behavior was also harmful by leading her on and making a derogatory comment.\n\nThe key points are: Did the author overreact? The author was wronged by Aaron's actions, so her response, while possibly harsh, could be seen as a justified reaction to being mistreated. However, the line is whether the author's actions were proportionate. The author's response was to confront and mock him, which might not be appropriate, but given the context, it's a defensive reaction. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), it's because the author should have handled it differently. If B (no), it's because Aaron was in the wrong first and the author had a right to defend herself.\n\nIn the \"Am I the Asshole\" format, often the person who is wronged but reacts in a way that could be seen as excessive might still not be the asshole. But in this case, the author was clearly hurt and Aaron's comment was the trigger. The author's reaction is understandable, but the spamming might be a problem. However, the core issue is Aaron's behavior. I think the answer is B (No), because the author is responding to being wronged, and while her actions might not be perfect, she's not the one at fault here. Aaron led her on and made a hurtful comment, so the author isn't the asshole.\n"
