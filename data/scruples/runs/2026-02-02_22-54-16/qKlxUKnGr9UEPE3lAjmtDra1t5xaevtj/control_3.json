I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is in a flirty, almost dating situation with their friend Aaron. They had this conversation where Aaron told the author he's not interested in a relationship because he's not into girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author confronts him directly, and Aaron confirms that he meant the author is fat. The author gets upset, calls Aaron a bad person, and then starts spamming him with memes. Aaron blocks the author and accuses them of making him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\" The author is conflicted about whether they were right to be angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out could be seen as a personal preference, but the author is rightly pointing out that it's a way to express weight bias. Weight bias is a real issue, and making someone feel bad for being fat is hurtful. However, Aaron did tell the author directly, so maybe he's being honest about his preferences, even if it's not politically correct.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction includes calling Aaron a \"piece of shit\" and spamming him with memes that are likely offensive. While Aaron's comment was hurtful, the author's response might have escalated things. Using harsh language and spamming messages could be seen as aggressive and possibly crossing a line. The author might be justified in feeling hurt and angry, but their response might not be the healthiest way to handle it.\n\nBut then again, the author points out that Aaron led them on by being flirty and going on dates, which made the author believe there was a chance for a relationship. Aaron's sudden rejection after leading them on could be considered leading someone on, which is unfair. The author's anger might stem from feeling manipulated or used. However, the way they responded (spamming and aggressive messages) isn't helpful, even if their feelings are valid.\n\nSo, the key points are: Aaron made a hurtful comment about the author's weight, the author confronted him, and then reacted with anger and spam. The author's actions might be excusable given the hurt, but the method of response is questionable. However, Aaron's comment was still wrong, so the author isn't entirely in the wrong either. It's a balance between the hurt caused by Aaron's comment and the author's reaction. The author might not be the asshole because they were defending themselves against weight bias, but their response could have been more constructive. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering that the author was on the receiving end of a biased comment and reacted emotionally, even if not perfectly, the answer might lean towards B (not the asshole). But if the author's response was overly aggressive, maybe A. But given the context, the author's anger is understandable, so B.\n"
