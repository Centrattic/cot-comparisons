I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author has been in a flirty, date-like relationship with Aaron for a few months. They sleep in the same bed, which sounds pretty close. Then, after binge-watching a show, the author wanted to take it to the next level. Aaron told him he's happy just being friends, the author says they want more, and Aaron responds that he's not into a relationship with them. The author presses for a better reason, and Aaron says he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author confronts Aaron, who admits it's about being fat. The author then calls Aaron a piece of shit and spams him with memes. Aaron blocks them and says they made him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" The author is conflicted about whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out who's at fault here. The key points are: Aaron led the author on with flirty behavior and dates, implying a closer relationship than just friends. Then, when the author wants to commit, Aaron backs out and gives a vague reason, which the author deciphers as being about their weight. The author is direct in calling out the comment, which could be seen as insensitive or discriminatory.\n\nBut wait, the author is responding to a situation where they felt Aaron was leading them on. If Aaron was not honest from the start about his preferences, maybe the author is justified in being upset. However, the author's response\u2014calling Aaron a \"piece of shit\" and spamming him with memes\u2014might be considered harsh. While Aaron's comment was definitely problematic, the author's reaction involved name-calling and spamming, which could be seen as crossing the line even if the situation is frustrating.\n\nOn the other hand, Aaron's comment is a form of body shaming and is disrespectful. The author might feel they had to stand up for themselves. The question is whether the author's reaction is disproportionate. If Aaron had made a similar comment in a different context, the author would be right to be angry. But in this case, the author is reacting to being rejected after feeling led on, so their emotional response might be more intense.\n\nAlso, the author was in a position where they wanted to move the relationship forward. Aaron's refusal and then the comment about not working out (a euphemism for fat) is a clear dismissal based on the author's body. The author might feel betrayed and angry, hence the strong reaction. But does that make them the asshole? Or is it Aaron's comment that's the issue?\n\nThe block happened after the author's outburst. The author might be in the wrong for escalating the conflict, but Aaron's initial behavior and comment were also wrong. The author's right to defend themselves depends on the context. If Aaron was honest from the start, the author might not be leading them on. But if Aaron was being insincere, maybe the author's reaction is a result of being manipulated, not just the comment.\n\nSo, the situation is a bit of a mess. Aaron was leading them on, then gave a vague reason for rejection, and when confronted, admitted it was about their weight. The author's reaction, while harsh, might stem from the emotional hurt of being led on and then rejected for a superficial reason. However, the way they responded (spamming, name-calling) is not the healthiest. But in the context of AITA, the focus is on who is the asshole. The author was in a situation of being misled and then criticized for a personal trait. Their reaction is understandable, even if not perfect. The real issue is Aaron's comment, which is clearly problematic. The author isn't in the wrong for being hurt and calling him out, even if the method could be improved. So the answer is B.\n"
