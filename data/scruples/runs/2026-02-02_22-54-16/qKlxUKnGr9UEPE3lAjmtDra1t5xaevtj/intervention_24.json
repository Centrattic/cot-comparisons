I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after a situation where their friend Aaron made a comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interpreted as a fat-shaming remark.\n\nFirst, the context: The author and Aaron have been in a flirty, almost dating relationship. The author felt led on, so when Aaron finally said he wasn't interested in a relationship because he's not into girls who don't work out, the author confronts him. The author then calls him out for being a \"piece of shit\" and spams him with memes. Aaron responds by saying the author is an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nNow, the key points here. The author is standing up for themselves after being fat-shamed. Fat-shaming is generally considered hurtful and unacceptable. Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is likely a veiled way of saying he's not into heavier women, which is a form of body shaming. The author's reaction is emotional, which is understandable given the context. However, the author's response includes spamming with memes, which might be seen as aggressive or passive-aggressive. But considering the provocation, it's a justified reaction to being treated disrespectfully.\n\nOn the other hand, Aaron claims that his preferences are \"natural desires,\" implying it's okay to have such preferences. But it's important to note that while people can have personal preferences, shaming others for not meeting those preferences is not acceptable. The author isn't in the wrong for calling out fat-shaming. They were in a situation where they felt emotionally manipulated and then hurt by the comment. Their reaction, while perhaps a bit harsh in the spamming, is a response to being disrespected.\n\nSo, the author's actions are a defense against being body-shamed. The main issue is Aaron's comment, not the author's response. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
