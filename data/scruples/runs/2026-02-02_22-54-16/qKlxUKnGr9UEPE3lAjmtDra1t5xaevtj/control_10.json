I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the story) is in the wrong. The situation is about a relationship where the guy, Aaron, led the author on by being flirty and having dates, but then when the author wanted to take it further, he rejected her by saying he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which she took as a fat-shaming comment. The author then called him out and spammed him with memes, leading to an argument where Aaron said she made him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author felt led on by Aaron, who was being flirty and engaging in behaviors that suggested more than friendship. When the author expressed wanting a deeper relationship, Aaron rejected her using a comment about not being attracted to women who don't work out. The author interpreted this as fat-shaming, which is a valid concern because body-shaming is hurtful and harmful. \n\nOn the other hand, Aaron claims he was just stating his preferences, which he might see as a \"natural desire.\" However, fat-shaming is generally considered inappropriate and discriminatory. So, his comment could be seen as crossing a line. The author's response was to call him out and use memes that were critical of his behavior. \n\nNow, the key question is whether the author is in the wrong. If Aaron was being hypocritical by leading her on and then using body-shaming to reject her, then the author's reaction is justified. She had every right to feel hurt and to confront him. However, if her response was overly harsh or if she crossed a line in her communication (like spamming him with memes), that might be a problem. But given the context of being led on and then rejected with a fat-shaming comment, her reaction seems to be a response to his behavior rather than an unprovoked attack.\n\nAdditionally, the author's half-feeling bad might indicate some guilt, but it's possible she's processing the situation correctly. The memes she sent are likely about body positivity, which is a valid stance. The question is whether her actions were a reasonable response to being mistreated. Since Aaron was the one who used a hurtful comment, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for defending herself and calling out his behavior. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she was responding to being led on and then rejected with a fat-shaming remark. Her actions were a justified reaction to his behavior.\n"
