I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The key points here are the friend's comments about the author being his \"ideal girlfriend\" but then saying he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. \n\nFirst, the friend, Aaron, led the author on by engaging in flirty behavior and what the author considers dates. This creates an expectation of a romantic relationship. When confronted, he says he's not interested in a relationship and gives a reason related to her body, which the author took as fat-shaming. \n\nThe author then responds by calling him a piece of shit and spamming him with memes that are related to body positivity. The friend claims she made him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" The author is conflicted but feels justified in defending herself.\n\nNow, considering the moral aspects: Was Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out a form of fat-shaming? If so, the author's reaction could be seen as a justified stand against being discriminated against based on her appearance. However, her response of spamming him with memes might be seen as excessive, even if she felt hurt. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was in a situation where she felt led on and then rejected based on her body, which is a sensitive and personal issue. Her reaction, while perhaps harsh, might be a way of processing the hurt and asserting her worth. \n\nThe question is whether her response was in the wrong. If someone is being discriminated against and responds by calling the offender out, even harshly, it might be seen as a valid reaction. However, spamming someone with memes could be considered unprofessional or immature, depending on the context. But in an emotional situation, people often act impulsively.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and I can see that reasoning. The core issue is the friend's fat-shaming, which is problematic regardless of how the author responded. But the author's actions (spamming, harsh language) might be seen as crossing a line, even if provoked. However, given the context of being emotionally manipulated and then rejected for her body, her anger and frustration are understandable. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, while both parties have faults, the primary wrongdoing is from Aaron for leading her on and making a discriminatory comment. The author's response is a reaction to that, so she's not entirely at fault. However, her actions could be seen as unkind in return. But considering the circumstances, maybe not in the wrong. So I'd lean towards B (Not in the wrong).\n"
