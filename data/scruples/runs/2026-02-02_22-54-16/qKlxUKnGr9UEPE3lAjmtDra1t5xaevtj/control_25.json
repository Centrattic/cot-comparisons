I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend, Aaron, who the author was in a flirty, almost romantic relationship with. The key point is when Aaron says the author would be his \"ideal girlfriend\" but then immediately adds that he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author then confronts him, and the conversation deteriorates, leading to arguments and the author spamming him with memes.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is problematic. The author feels that this is a veiled way of saying he isn't attracted to fat women. It's possible that Aaron was using \"don't work out\" as a euphemism for body type, but it's also possible he was referring to fitness levels. However, given the context where the author felt led on, the comment might be seen as discriminatory or body-shaming, even if Aaron didn't mean it that way.\n\nNext, the author reacts strongly by calling Aaron a piece of shit and spamming him with memes. The memes are related to body positivity, which the author finds offensive. The question is whether the author overreacted. On one hand, being called fat in a context of rejection can be hurtful, and the author might feel that Aaron's comment was a backhanded way of rejecting her. On the other hand, the author's response of spamming him with memes and harsh words could be seen as aggressive and unkind, possibly making the situation worse.\n\nThe author also mentions feeling both guilty and justified. It's important to consider mutual accountability here. If Aaron made a comment that the author found offensive, the author has the right to express their feelings. However, the method of response (spamming with memes and harsh language) might not be the most constructive. Additionally, Aaron's comment about \"natural desires\" could be defending his own biases, which is problematic if he's using that to justify body-shaming.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, being honest about not being attracted to someone is one thing, but using coded language that targets someone's body image is another. The author might have every right to feel hurt and to confront Aaron. However, the way she did it led to both parties feeling wronged. The key here is whether the author overstepped in her response. While the initial comment was hurtful, the author's reaction of spamming and harsh language could be seen as unkind, even if she had a valid reason. However, given that Aaron was dismissive and made a potentially offensive remark, the author's reaction might be justified as self-respect and standing up for herself.\n\nIn conclusion, both parties have some responsibility. Aaron's comment was likely hurtful and possibly discriminatory, while the author's response was aggressive. However, the primary wrongdoing might lie with Aaron for making the offensive comment and then dismissing the author's feelings by calling her an asshole. The author's actions, while harsh, were a reaction to being mistreated. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong; the answer is B.\n"
