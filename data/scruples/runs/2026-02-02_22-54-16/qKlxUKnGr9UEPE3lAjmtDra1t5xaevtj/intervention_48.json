I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves Aaron, a guy the author has been in a flirty, possibly dating relationship with. They've had sleepovers and other activities typically associated with being more than just friends. Then, when the author wants to take things to the next level, Aaron says he's happy being friends and that he's not into relationships with her because he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for being fat. The author confronts him, he confirms it, and she reacts strongly, calling him out and spamming his social media with memes. He then calls her an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider if Aaron's comments were acceptable. Making a comment about someone's weight or fitness level being a reason for not wanting a relationship can be seen as discriminatory. However, attraction is subjective, and people can be honest about their preferences. But the way he phrased it (\"girls who don't work out\") might come off as a backhanded way to express a preference for certain body types, which can be hurtful.\n\nThe author's reaction: She's upset, confronts him directly, and then uses memes to express her feelings. Spamming him could be seen as excessive, but it's also a form of emotional expression. The key points are whether Aaron led her on and if the author's response was justified.\n\nLeading someone on implies that he gave false hope or signals that he wasn't interested in a serious relationship. The story says the relationship was very flirty with dates and sleepovers, which might suggest he didn't make his boundaries clear. The author felt he led her on, which is a common feeling in such situations.\n\nWhen Aaron's reason for not wanting a relationship is based on physical appearance, that's a problem because it's a shallow reason and can be hurtful. The author's response of calling him out and expressing her anger is understandable. However, spamming him with memes might be seen as aggressive or unprofessional, especially if it's on social media. But considering the emotional context, it's a reaction to feeling rejected and disrespected.\n\nThe author's feelings of being half-bad but also justified indicate internal conflict. She might feel that she's handling the situation with anger but also that she deserved better. Aaron's retaliation of calling her an asshole for his own words is questionable. If he made a hurtful comment, he can't really blame her for being upset.\n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out (which the author feels is a code for fat) is the main issue here. The author's response, while perhaps a bit over the top with the spamming, was a reaction to feeling disrespected and led on. So the primary wrongdoer is Aaron for making a discriminatory comment and not being clear about his intentions, leading to the author's justified but maybe excessive reaction. The author isn't entirely in the wrong because she's reacting to Aaron's behavior. However, spamming might not be the best way to handle it. But the core issue is Aaron's comments. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
