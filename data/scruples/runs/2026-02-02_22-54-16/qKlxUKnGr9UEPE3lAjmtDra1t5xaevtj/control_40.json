I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the \"AITA\" questioner) is responsible for making their friend Aaron feel bad after a conversation where Aaron rejected them. The situation is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, let me recap the scenario. The author has been in a flirty, almost dating relationship with Aaron. They had a conversation where Aaron told them he's happy just being friends, and they wanted more. Aaron then said he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interpreted as a comment on their weight. The author confronted him, got angry, and started spamming him with memes. Aaron called them an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\" The author is now unsure if they're the bad guy here.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, Aaron's actions: He engaged in a flirty, possibly leading on behavior, including dates and sleeping in the same bed. When the author wanted to take things further, he rejected her, but gave a comment about her not working out, which implies a preference for women who are physically fit. The author took that as a personal attack on her weight and reacted strongly.\n\nNow, the author's response: They called Aaron a \"piece of shit,\" told him to leave, and then started spamming him with memes that are clearly about body shaming. The memes were from their favorite bloggers, which probably have a message about body positivity. But the way they used them\u2014spamming Aaron\u2014might be seen as aggressive or retaliatory.\n\nAaron's reaction: He felt that the author was making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires,\" which he frames as his personal preferences. The author, on the other hand, felt justified in calling him out for his comment about her weight.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. \n\nOn one hand, Aaron's comment about not being attracted to women who don't work out is problematic. It could be seen as body shaming, implying that the author's weight is a reason he's not interested. The author had the right to be upset and to express that. Reacting emotionally to rejection is normal, but the author's response might have been excessive.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did confront Aaron directly when he made the comment about her weight, which is a valid response. However, spamming him with memes afterward might be seen as harassment, even if the content is about body positivity. The line between standing up for oneself and retaliating can be blurry here.\n\nAlso, the fact that Aaron was leading her on by participating in flirty behavior and dates before rejecting her complicates things. If he was leading her on, then he's also at fault. But the author's response of calling him an asshole and spamming him might be seen as harsh, even if he was wrong.\n\nThe key points here are mutual responsibility. Aaron's comment about weight is hurtful and objectifying, which is wrong. The author's reaction, while understandable, might have crossed a line by spamming him with messages. The author's actions could be seen as a justified emotional response to being rejected and made to feel bad, but the method (spamming) is questionable.\n\nIn terms of the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the author's response was proportionate. If Aaron made a hurtful comment, the author had the right to be upset, but the way they expressed it (spamming) might be seen as the wrong approach. Alternatively, if the author had a right to be angry, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, the key is that Aaron made the initial hurtful comment, which is his fault, but the author's actions after might be seen as their own wrongdoing.\n\nIn many of these AITA scenarios, if someone is being called out for making a hurtful comment, and the other person reacts strongly, the one making the hurtful comment is often the one in the wrong. But the author's spamming could be seen as going too far. It's a tough call. However, the fact that Aaron's comment was about the author's weight (body shaming) is a significant issue. The author's response was in direct reaction to that, so it's possible they're not in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, because they were standing up for themselves against a hurtful comment. However, the spamming might be the issue. But in these scenarios, defending oneself against body shaming is often seen as justified, even if the response is a bit harsh. So maybe the author is not in the wrong.\n"
