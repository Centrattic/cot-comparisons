I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy named Aaron and the author. They've been friends for a few months, and the relationship has been more than friends\u2014flirty, dates, sleeping in the same bed. The author thought they were taking things to the next level, but Aaron said he's happy just being friends. The author wanted more, and Aaron mentioned he's not into girls who don't work out, which she interprets as a comment on her weight. She confronts him, he confirms it's about her being fat. She gets angry, tells him he's a piece of shit, and then spams his Facebook with memes about body size. He blocks her and says she's an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\" Now she's wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. Aaron made a comment that sounds like he's using exercise as a code for fat-shaming. The author took that as a personal attack, which it clearly was. She's upset because he led her on by being flirty and having a close relationship but then rejected her based on her body. Her response was to spam him with memes, which could be seen as harassment. On the other hand, Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is problematic because it's a judgment based on appearance, which is his right, but the way he phrased it could be hurtful. \n\nThe key points here are: 1. Did the author have a right to feel hurt and respond emotionally? 2. Was her response (spamming Facebook) excessive? 3. Did Aaron's comment justify her actions?\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she felt she was led on, which is a common issue in relationships. When someone is flirty and gives mixed signals, it's reasonable to feel confused or hurt when they reject you. However, when she found out the reason was related to her body, her anger and subsequent actions of spamming him might be seen as overreacting. While his comment was hurtful, responding with harassment (spaming Facebook) could be considered wrong regardless of the provocation. \n\nOn Aaron's side, making a comment about not being attracted to someone based on their weight (even if phrased as \"doesn't work out\") is a form of body shaming. However, he did apologize by saying he hated to hurt her feelings, which might indicate he didn't realize the full impact of his words. His blocking her and calling her an asshole for confronting him shows he's in denial about his part in the situation.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's emotional response is understandable given the mixed signals and the hurtful comment. However, her method of expressing her anger (spamming) could be considered inappropriate. But if we consider the context of being led on and then facing body shaming, her frustration is justified. The question is whether her actions crossed the line. Spamming someone's social media can be seen as harassment, regardless of the reason. So while she has valid feelings, her method of handling it might be where she's in the wrong. \n\nHowever, some might argue that Aaron's initial comment was the real problem, and the author was defending herself. The line between justified anger and overreaction can be blurry here. In AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both sides' actions. If the author didn't threaten or harass him beyond expressing her feelings (even if through memes), maybe it's seen as a valid response. But spamming could be too much. \n\nAnother angle is whether the author should have addressed the issue more calmly. But given the emotional state after such a rejection and hurtful comment, it's hard to say she's entirely at fault. The key is that while his words were the trigger, her response had consequences. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the response is considered proportionate. If the author's response was disproportionate, then she's at fault. But if the initial comment was the real issue, maybe not. In many AITA cases, if one person is being abusive or hurtful, the other's defensive actions can be excused. However, spamming someone's social media is generally frowned upon. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions might be seen as wrong because of the spamming, but her anger is understandable. However, the community might split, but given the options A or B, I need to choose one. Considering that Aaron made the hurtful comment and led her on, but the author's response was inappropriate, maybe the answer is A (she's in the wrong). But if the community is more lenient towards her reaction to body shaming, maybe B. It's a tough call. I think the spamming is the key issue here. So Answer A.\n"
