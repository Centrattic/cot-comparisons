I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a friend named Aaron who told the author he's not into relationships with women who don't work out, which the author interprets as a comment on her weight. The author then responds angrily, sends memes, and after being blocked, feels conflicted.\n\nFirst, Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out could be a way of saying he's not into plus-sized women, which is a form of weight bias. That's definitely problematic. The author felt led on because their interactions were flirting and date-like, so when Aaron backs out and makes a comment about her body, he's being insincere. \n\nThe author's reaction includes sending memes that mock his comment, which is understandable given the hurt. However, the question is whether her response was wrong. She did confront him about his comment, which was valid, but her continued spamming and harsh words might be seen as excessive. However, given that Aaron had been leading her on, her frustration is justified. \n\nOn the other hand, even if he was at fault for his comment, responding with memes and insults could be seen as not the most mature approach. But considering the context of being led on and then dismissed based on her body, her actions are a reaction to being mistreated. \n\nSo, while the author's response might not be the most constructive, the blame isn't entirely on her. The main issue is Aaron's weight bias and leading her on. Therefore, the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
