I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their friend feel bad after a situation where the friend told them they were his \"ideal girlfriend\" but then later said he's not into girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat shaming.\n\nFirst, the author and Aaron had a close, flirty relationship with dates and sleeping together. The author wanted to take it further, but Aaron said he's not interested in a relationship. Then, he specifically mentioned not being attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author directly interpreted as a comment on her weight. The author confronts him, and he confirms he means she's fat. She responds by calling him a piece of shit and sending memes that are clearly about body shaming. He blocks her and says she made him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\"\n\nNow, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, Aaron made a hurtful comment about the author's weight, which is a sensitive and personal issue. Calling someone fat can be really damaging, especially if it's used to reject them. The author's reaction was to confront him and express her anger, which is a natural emotional response. She then sent memes that were critical of his behavior, which might have been harsh but were in response to his direct insult.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did spam him on Facebook with memes, which could be seen as aggressive. However, this was a reaction to being fat-shamed. The key point here is that Aaron's comment about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is a form of body shaming. The author directly asked if he meant she was fat, and he confirmed it. That makes his comment even more offensive because he was using a euphemism to hurt her.\n\nIn terms of accountability, Aaron is in the wrong for making a derogatory comment about the author's body weight. The author's reaction, while perhaps intense, is a justified emotional response to being fat-shamed. The memes she sent were likely meant to call out his behavior and make him aware of how his words affected her. Even though she might have overreacted in the immediacy of her hurt, the root of the issue is Aaron's inappropriate comment. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because she was standing up for herself against a harmful statement. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
