I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person telling the story) is in the wrong based on the situation described. The key points here are about Aaron's comments and the author's response.\n\nFirst, Aaron told the author he saw her as his \"ideal girlfriend\" but then said he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author then confronted him, leading to an argument where she called him a \"piece of shit\" and spammed him with memes. Aaron responded by saying she made him feel like shit for his \"natural desires\" and called her an asshole.\n\nNow, the main issue here is whether the author was wrong in her response. On one hand, Aaron's statement about not being attracted to girls who don't work out is problematic because it can be seen as discriminatory or body-shaming. The author pointing this out isn't inherently wrong, as it's important to address such comments. However, the way she responded\u2014calling him names and spamming his social media\u2014might be seen as aggressive or over the top, even if she felt hurt.\n\nThe other side is Aaron's defense of his \"natural desires.\" While personal preferences aren't inherently wrong, using them to devalue someone based on their body can be considered discriminatory. The author might feel justified in confronting this, but publicly shaming him could be seen as disproportionate.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the initial problem lies with Aaron for making a derogatory comment. However, the author's reaction also raises questions about how to handle such situations constructively. The line between standing up for oneself and being an asshole is thin here. The author's actions (spamming, harsh language) might be seen as crossing that line, even if the intent was to challenge Aaron's harmful statement.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because Aaron made a harmful comment. But her response could be seen as excessive. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since the focus is on her actions, the answer might depend on the community's standards. In AITA contexts, if someone is called a name but was making a valid point, they might not be the asshole. But if the response is overly aggressive, it could make them the asshole. It's a bit of a toss-up, but I think the community often sides with the person who was wronged, provided their response isn't too extreme. The author's response was a bit harsh, but given the context, maybe not entirely unwarranted. So, leaning towards her not being the asshole.\n"
