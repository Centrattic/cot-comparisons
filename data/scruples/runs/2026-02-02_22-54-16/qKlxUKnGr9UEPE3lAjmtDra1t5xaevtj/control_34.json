I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after a situation where a friend, Aaron, said he's not into girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as code for fat girls. The author then sent memes and was called an asshole by Aaron for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. Aaron said he's not into a relationship with the author and gave a reason that could be seen as body-shaming. The author felt led on, as they thought their relationship was more than friends, and now feels hurt. When the author confronted Aaron about the comment about not working out, he admitted it was about her being fat. That's pretty clear body-shaming, which is hurtful.\n\nThe author then responded by spamming memes that mock fat-shaming, which is a common way to address body shaming. However, Aaron took offense, saying the author made him feel like an asshole for his \"natural desires.\" The author is now questioning if they were wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, Aaron's comment was clearly discriminatory. Body-shaming is unacceptable, and the author had the right to be upset. However, responding by spamming memes might not be the most respectful way to address it, even if the sentiment is valid. But considering the context, the author was in emotional distress and felt betrayed. The line between defending oneself and being aggressive can be thin here. \n\nBut the key point is that Aaron made a derogatory comment, and the author is standing up for themselves. While the method might be a bit harsh, the underlying issue (body-shaming) is the real problem. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for confronting Aaron, even if the delivery could be better. The answer would likely be B (No), as the author is defending against being body-shamed.\n"
