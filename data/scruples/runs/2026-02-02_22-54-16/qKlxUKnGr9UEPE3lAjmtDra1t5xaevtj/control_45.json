I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a friend, Aaron, who has been leading the author on with flirtatious behavior, going on dates, and sleeping together. Then, when the author wants to take it to the next level, Aaron says he's not into relationships but clarifies he's not attracted to girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author confronts him, he confirms it's about her weight, she gets angry, calls him a name, and sends memes. He then blocks her, calling her an asshole for making him feel bad for his \"natural desires.\"\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. From the information given, Aaron led the author on by engaging in behaviors that are typically associated with a romantic relationship, like going on dates and sleeping together. This could be seen as leading her on, as he didn't make his disinterest in a relationship clear until she wanted to take things further. The author then confronts him, which is a reasonable reaction when someone feels they've been misled. \n\nWhen Aaron says he's not attracted to girls who don't work out and then confirms it's about her weight, that's clearly a derogatory statement. The author's response\u2014calling him a name and sending memes\u2014could be seen as a reaction to being insulted. However, the question is whether her actions make her the asshole. \n\nOn one hand, responding with anger and spamming him with memes might be seen as aggressive or not the most mature way to handle the situation. On the other hand, she was hurt and felt manipulated, and he made a comment about her body, which is offensive. Her actions, while perhaps harsh, might be a justified emotional reaction. \n\nThe key points here are whether Aaron was in the wrong first by leading her on and making a derogatory comment. If he was the one who was insincere and then made a fat-shaming remark, the author's reaction might be understandable. However, the author's response could be seen as crossing a line by spamming him and using harsh language. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's not okay to make someone feel bad for their preferences, making derogatory comments about someone's body is also wrong. The author might feel justified in standing up for herself, but her actions could be seen as retaliatory. The line between justified anger and being in the wrong is blurry here. \n\nConsidering the context, I think the author's actions were a reaction to being led on and then insulted. However, the way she responded might be seen as harsh, but given the hurtful comment from Aaron, it's a bit of a gray area. The question is whether the author is the asshole, and given that Aaron made the offensive remark, the author's response, while possibly over the top, could be seen as a justified reaction to being mistreated. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
