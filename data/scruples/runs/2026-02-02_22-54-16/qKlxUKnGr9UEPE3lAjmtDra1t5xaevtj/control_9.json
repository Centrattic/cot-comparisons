I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it. I sort of half feel bad but I also feel like I said what needed do he said. Am I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the user is asking for an answer between A or B, where A is yes (they're wrong) and B is no (they're not). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a situation where their friend Aaron, with whom they've been having a flirty, quasi-relationship, told them that they're his \"ideal girlfriend\" but then also said he's not into girls who don't work out, which the author interprets as a code for fat girls. The author felt led on because of the flirting and the \"dates,\" and when they tried to take things further, Aaron said he's not into a relationship and made a comment about the author's weight. The author confronted him, and he admitted it was about her weight. They got into an argument, and the author sent memes about size, leading Aaron to block them and call the author an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\" The author feels conflicted but also justified.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, Aaron's behavior: He had a flirty, dating-like relationship with the author, which led them to believe there was a chance of a real relationship. Then, when the author tried to take it further, he rejected her and gave a reason that seems based on her weight. This is problematic because it's a form of body shaming and could be considered discriminatory. His comments about not being attracted to girls who don't work out (which the author clarifies he meant fat girls) are clearly weight-based preferences. That's hurtful and could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nThe author, feeling hurt and led on, confronts Aaron. She's angry and tells him off, which is a natural reaction. Then she sends memes about body size, which are likely sarcastic or mocking. When Aaron blocks her, he calls her an asshole for making him feel bad about his \"natural desires.\" The author then questions if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong here? Let's consider the context. If Aaron was being honest and the author was overreacting, maybe the author would be in the wrong. But in this case, Aaron's comments are about weight, which is a sensitive topic. The author was in a situation where she felt led on and then rejected based on something personal about her body. Her reaction, while perhaps intense (spamming Facebook with memes), is a response to being hurt and disrespected. \n\nHowever, the author could have handled it differently. Yelling or sending memes might not be the best way to handle the situation, but the root of the issue is Aaron's discriminatory comment. The author is defending herself against what he said, which is the real problem. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, Aaron's initial comment is the main issue here. He's using his personal preferences as a justification for rejecting someone, which is a common problem but doesn't make it right. The author's reaction, while maybe harsh, is a response to being hurt and disrespected. \n\nBut does that make the author in the right? Well, the author was in a situation where she felt manipulated into believing there was a chance for a relationship, only to be rejected for a discriminatory reason. Her reaction, while perhaps not the most mature, is understandable given the emotional context. \n\nOn the other hand, Aaron is pointing out that the author is making him feel bad for his \"natural desires,\" implying that his preferences are natural and thus acceptable. That's a problematic stance because it's using personal preferences as a defense for discriminatory behavior. The author is challenging that, which could be seen as standing up for herself. \n\nSo, the key factors here are: Aaron's discriminatory comment, the author's emotional response to being hurt and disrespected, and the author's attempt to hold Aaron accountable for his words. \n\nIn terms of the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Given that Aaron made a discriminatory comment and the author is reacting to that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the author's method of confronting Aaron (spamming Facebook) might be seen as excessive or immature, but the root issue is Aaron's behavior. \n\nIn many \"Am I the Asshole\" scenarios, the person who is being wronged isn't the asshole, even if their reaction isn't perfect. The main problem here is Aaron's discriminatory behavior. The author is standing up for herself against that, which is valid. So, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
