They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about checking their girlfriend's phone without permission. Let me break it down. The girlfriend has been hanging out with her high school friends, and the author found out one of them was a guy. They went through her WhatsApp messages and discovered flirting. Then, the author sent a message to the group chat, maybe a bit drunk, saying she has a boyfriend and isn't going out with them again if the guy is there.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the act of going through the girlfriend's phone. That's a privacy violation. Even if the author had suspicions, looking without consent is a problem. Trust is important in relationships, and checking someone's phone without their knowledge can break that trust. The author might have felt insecure or threatened, but that doesn't justify the action. \n\nThen there's the part about sending a message to the group chat. The author admits they were a bit drunk and maybe extreme. Publicly confronting the girlfriend's friends in a group chat could be seen as overreacting. It might have caused embarrassment to the girlfriend and others. The reasoning is that the author wanted to protect their relationship, but the method used was confrontational and possibly hurtful.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend found out and there was a big argument. The author now has the phone and is considering not returning it. That's another issue\u2014keeping someone's phone after an argument is not a good idea. It can escalate the conflict and is a form of retaliation.\n\nSo, the author's actions\u2014both checking the phone and the public confrontation\u2014seem to be in the wrong. They violated privacy, acted impulsively, and are now holding onto the phone as leverage. Even if the motive was to address the flirting, the method wasn't respectful or appropriate. The right approach would have been to talk to the girlfriend directly and address the issue without spying or public shaming.\n"
