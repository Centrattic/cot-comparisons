They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for going through their girlfriend's phone. \n\nFirst, the key points: The author found out that their girlfriend has been spending a lot of time with her high school friends, one of whom is a guy. They checked her WhatsApp messages without her knowledge and found flirting. Then they sent a message to the group chat, got caught, had an argument, and now are keeping the phone.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the act of checking her phone without permission. Even if they had reasons like jealousy or suspicion, invading someone's privacy is a big no-no. Consent is important in any relationship. The author might feel insecure, but that doesn't justify going through her messages. \n\nAlso, sending a message to the group chat was a direct confrontation, which could be seen as aggressive. The author admits they were drunk, which might have clouded their judgment. However, being drunk doesn't excuse the actions. \n\nThe aftermath is that the girlfriend is upset, they had a big argument, and the author is holding onto her phone. Keeping her phone isn't helping the situation. The author's actions, while possibly coming from a place of insecurity, are definitely a breach of trust and privacy. \n\nRelationships require trust, and checking someone's phone without their knowledge goes against that. Even if there's a reason, it's better to communicate openly rather than snoop. The author's actions hurt the relationship and broke a trust boundary. So, they are in the wrong here.\n"
