They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who went through their girlfriend's phone is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe person, the author, found out that their girlfriend has been spending a lot of time with her high school friends, which turns out includes a guy. They went through her phone, found a group chat where the guy was flirting, and then sent a message to the group chat. The girlfriend caught them, there was an argument, and now the author is holding onto her phone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the act of going through someone's phone. In most relationships, checking a partner's phone without consent is generally seen as a breach of trust and privacy. Even if there's suspicion or jealousy involved, the method of addressing it by invading privacy might be problematic. The author's actions could be seen as a violation of boundaries, which is why many would argue they're in the wrong.\n\nThen there's the part where the author sent a message to the group chat. That's a bit more complicated. On one hand, they're standing up for themselves and their relationship by addressing the flirting. But doing it in a public group chat, especially when drunk, might escalate the situation. It's possible that a more private conversation with the girlfriend would have been better to resolve the issue without involving others.\n\nThe author mentions they were drunk when they did this. While being under the influence doesn't excuse the actions, it might explain why the response was more extreme. However, that doesn't negate the fact that they took matters into their own hands without discussing it with their girlfriend first.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also important. If she felt her privacy was invaded, that's a valid concern. Trust is crucial in relationships, and such actions can erode it. The author's decision to keep her phone might be a power play, which could further damage the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel justified because they were trying to protect the relationship from what they perceived as flirting. But the way they handled it\u2014without communication\u2014might be the issue here. Healthy relationships require open communication rather than secretive actions.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the author might have felt threatened by the group chat, their method of addressing it by invading privacy and public confrontation is likely where they went wrong. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because their actions violated the girlfriend's privacy and escalated the conflict without proper communication.\n"
