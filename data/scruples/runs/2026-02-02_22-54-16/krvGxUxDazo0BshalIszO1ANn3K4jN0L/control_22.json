They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who went through their girlfriend's phone is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, the main issue here is privacy. Checking someone's phone without their consent is a big breach of trust. Even if there were valid suspicions, like the girlfriend spending time with someone else, the method of confronting the issue matters. The author didn't confront her directly first but instead went through her phone secretly. That's a red flag. \n\nThen, when they found messages, they decided to message the group chat while drunk, which escalated the situation. Being drunk might have influenced their judgment, leading to an extreme reaction. The argument that followed and the refusal to return the phone further shows a lack of respect for her privacy and autonomy.\n\nEven though the other person might have done something to cause suspicion, the way the author handled it was wrong. Trust and communication are key in relationships. Instead of invading privacy, discussing concerns openly would be the healthier approach. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions\u2014snooping through the phone, the public confrontation via message, and holding onto the phone\u2014clearly cross the line. The right choice here is A.\n"
