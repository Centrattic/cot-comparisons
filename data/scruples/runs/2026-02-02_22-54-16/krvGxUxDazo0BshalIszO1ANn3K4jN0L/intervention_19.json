They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person went through their girlfriend's phone after finding out she was hanging out with a guy from her high school friends. They found flirtatious messages and then confronted them in a group chat, which led to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author admitted to going through the girlfriend's phone without her consent. That's a privacy issue. Even if there was suspicion of flirting, invading someone's privacy by checking their phone is generally considered wrong. Trust and communication are important in relationships, and snooping can erode trust. \n\nThe author also sent a message to the group chat, which might have been confrontational, especially since they were drunk. This could be seen as overreacting. Even if the messages were flirtatious, the way the author handled it might have been inappropriate. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend was spending a lot of time with someone else, and the flirtation could have been a legitimate concern. But that doesn't justify breaking into her phone. The right approach would have been to talk to her directly about the behavior instead of spying. \n\nSo, the main issue here is the violation of privacy. Most people would say that the author is in the wrong for going through the phone, regardless of the reason. The argument could have been handled better, and the method used was invasive. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
