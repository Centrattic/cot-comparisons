They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went through their girlfriend's phone because she was hanging out with high school friends, and one of them turned out to be a guy. The author found the guy was flirting with her and responded by sending a message to the group chat, which led to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author's actions were justified. The key points here are checking the phone without permission and the public confrontation in the group chat. \n\nGoing through someone's phone is a privacy issue. Even if the author had suspicions or feelings of jealousy, accessing private messages without consent is generally considered a breach of trust. Privacy is important in relationships, and doing something like this can damage trust. \n\nThen there's the response to the flirting. The author didn't talk to the girlfriend first but instead publicly confronted the guy in the group chat. This might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. A better approach would be to discuss concerns with the girlfriend directly rather than taking matters into their own hands.\n\nHowever, the author's motivation was to protect the relationship. Jealousy can lead to impulsive actions, especially when drunk. The fact that they were drunk might mitigate some responsibility, but it doesn't excuse the behavior entirely. \n\nThe girlfriend caught them with her phone, leading to a big argument. The author is now holding onto her phone, which is another issue. Withholding someone's belongings after an argument isn't helpful and can be seen as punitive.\n\nSo, while the author might have had a reason based on jealousy, the actions taken\u2014spying on the phone, public confrontation, and withholding the phone\u2014clearly caused harm. The right approach would be to address the issue through open communication rather than invasion of privacy and public shaming.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
