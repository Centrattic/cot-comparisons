They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who went through their girlfriend's phone is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend has been hanging out a lot with her high school friends, including a guy who's been flirting with her. The author took her phone, read her messages, then sent a message to the group chat confronting them.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the key points. The main issue here is privacy. Going through someone's phone without their consent is generally considered a violation of privacy. Even if the person has concerns about their partner's behavior, that doesn't automatically justify invading their privacy. Trust is a big part of relationships, and this action might erode that trust.\n\nThen there's the part where the author sent a message to the group chat, which was a public confrontation. That's probably why there was a big argument. The author was drunk, which might affect their judgment, but being drunk doesn't excuse the action. The girlfriend caught them, and now the author is holding onto the phone, which is a possessive and possibly threatening move.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned about their partner's behavior, especially since there was obvious flirting. However, the way they handled it was extreme and disrespectful. The right approach would be to communicate openly with the girlfriend about the concerns instead of spying. The author's actions, while stemming from jealousy, were not appropriate. So even if the situation is frustrating, the method used was wrong. The answer here would likely be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
