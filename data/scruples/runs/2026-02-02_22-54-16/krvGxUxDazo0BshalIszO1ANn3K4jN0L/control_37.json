They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went through their girlfriend's phone, found a guy flirting with her, then sent a message to the group chat, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is the act of going through the girlfriend's phone without consent. That's usually a big no-no because it's a violation of privacy. Even if there were suspicions or jealousy, accessing someone's phone without permission is generally considered wrong. \n\nThe author mentions they were drunk when they sent the message, which might mitigate the situation a bit, but it's still their choice to act in that way. The fact that they admitted to taking the phone and not returning it shows ongoing conflict. \n\nAnother angle is the girlfriend's actions. She didn't disclose that one of the friends was a guy until after the fact, which might have contributed to the author's suspicion. However, that doesn't justify the invasion of privacy. \n\nThe response to the group chat was extreme. Publicly confronting them in the chat and threatening not to go out with her friends could be seen as overreacting, even if there was a legitimate reason. It's important to address issues through open communication rather than taking unilateral actions.\n\nAlso, the author is withholding the phone now, which is another form of retaliation and can escalate the problem. Healthy relationships require trust and respect, and both parties should handle conflicts maturely.\n\nSo putting it all together, the main wrongdoing here is the unauthorized access to the phone. The author's actions, while possibly driven by jealousy, were not justified. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong, which is option A.\n"
