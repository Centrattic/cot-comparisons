They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for going through their girlfriend's phone. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend has been hanging out a lot with her high school friends, including a guy. The guy in the story (the author) finds out through her phone that this guy is flirting with her. He then messages the group chat to confront them. The main issue here is the act of going through her phone without permission.\n\nI remember that trust is a big part of relationships. Checking someone's phone without their knowledge is generally considered a breach of privacy. Even if the author had suspicions, invading her privacy might not be justified. The fact that he was drunk when he did this could add to the impulsiveness of the action, but it doesn't necessarily make it right.\n\nThe girlfriend found out, and they had a big argument. The author now has her phone and is considering not returning it. That seems like a power move, which might be problematic. Even if he had a reason to be upset, taking her phone and not returning it could be seen as holding it over her head, which isn't fair.\n\nSo, while the girlfriend's behavior (hanging out with a guy who's flirting with her) is a red flag, the author's method of addressing it was invasive. The right approach would have been to talk to her about his concerns instead of checking her phone. The act itself is a violation of her privacy, which is a significant issue in relationships. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he didn't respect her privacy, even if his intentions were to address a real problem.\n"
