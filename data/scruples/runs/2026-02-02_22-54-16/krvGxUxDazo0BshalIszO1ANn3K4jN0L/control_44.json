They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong by going through their girlfriend's phone.\n\nFirst, privacy is a big aspect here. Even in a relationship, people generally expect their personal devices to be private. The author took the phone without permission, which is a violation of that privacy. That's a clear red flag.\n\nThen, there's the act of sending a message to the group chat. Even if the author felt threatened, confronting the situation publicly in a group chat might be seen as aggressive or overstepping. It's possible the author should have discussed this with their girlfriend first instead of acting impulsively, especially while drunk.\n\nThe fact that the author is holding onto the phone and not returning it adds to the issue. It's a form of withholding property, which can be seen as retaliatory or controlling.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's behavior\u2014hanging out with a guy who's flirting with her\u2014could be seen as problematic. The author's concern might be valid, but the method of addressing it was flawed. Trust and communication are key in relationships, and this incident likely damaged both.\n\nConsidering all points, the author's actions\u2014invading privacy and acting without discussion\u2014make them responsible. The justification based on jealousy doesn't excuse the violation of trust and privacy.\n"
