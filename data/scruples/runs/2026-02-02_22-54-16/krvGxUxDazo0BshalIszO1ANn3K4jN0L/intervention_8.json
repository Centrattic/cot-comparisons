They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is a guy who found out his girlfriend has been hanging out a lot with her high school friends, which turned out to include a guy. He went through her phone without her permission and saw that this guy was flirting with her, using terms like \"babe\" and \"darling.\" Then he sent a message to the group chat, mentioning that she has a boyfriend and that she won't go out with them if he's there. They ended up arguing, and he took her phone home, not sure if he should return it.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I should consider the actions taken. The key issue here is going through someone's phone without their consent. That's a privacy violation. Even if the motivation was jealousy or concern, invading someone's privacy without their permission is generally considered wrong. The author did that, then escalated the situation by sending a message to the group chat. \n\nBut there's also the context: the girlfriend was spending a lot of time with someone else, and the guy was being flirtatious. The author felt threatened. However, the right approach would typically be to communicate openly with the girlfriend about the concerns rather than taking matters into one's own hands. Sending a message to the group chat could be seen as confrontational and disrespectful. Also, taking the phone and not returning it is a form of punishment and could be considered controlling behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel justified because of the flirting. But actions like invading privacy and public confrontation can harm trust and escalate conflicts. Even if there's truth to the flirting, the method of handling it is problematic. The author's actions might have crossed a line, making him at fault.\n\nSo, the main points are: privacy violation, confrontation without discussion, and taking the phone. These actions are generally seen as wrong, even if the intent was to protect the relationship. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
