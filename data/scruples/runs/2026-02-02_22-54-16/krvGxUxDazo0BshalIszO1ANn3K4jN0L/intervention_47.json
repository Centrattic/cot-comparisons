They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person went through their girlfriend's phone after finding out she's been hanging out with a guy from her high school. The writer admits to being drunk and sending a message in the group chat. They now have the phone and aren't sure if they should return it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the act of checking a partner's phone. In many relationships, trust is key. If someone goes through another's phone without permission, that's generally seen as a breach of privacy. Even if the motivation is jealousy or insecurity, the action itself is problematic. The writer's actions might have been a reaction to feeling threatened, but the method used is invasive.\n\nNext, the consequences: the girlfriend found out, they had a big argument, and the writer is holding onto her phone. This could escalate the conflict. The fact that the writer was drunk might mitigate some blame, but it's not an excuse. The message sent to the group chat was confrontational and public, which could be seen as shaming the girlfriend in front of others. That's another issue because it's not a mature way to handle the situation.\n\nThe girlfriend's behavior\u2014flirting in a group chat\u2014is also a problem. She's in a committed relationship, so flirting with someone else is unfaithful. But the question is about the writer's actions. Even if the girlfriend is at fault, the writer's means of addressing it by invading privacy is not acceptable. Trust issues should be discussed openly, not through surveillance.\n\nSo, the writer's actions violated the girlfriend's privacy, acted impulsively while drunk, and took a public stand that could damage the relationship. These actions are in the wrong regardless of the circumstances. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
