They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who went through their girlfriend's phone is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend hanging out with people, including a guy, and the boyfriend checking her phone. He found flirting messages and then confronted them in a group chat, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is privacy. Going through someone's phone without permission is a clear invasion of privacy. Even if there's suspicion or jealousy, that doesn't justify the action. The boyfriend's actions were unauthorized and violated trust. Then, he took it further by sending a message to the group chat, which escalated the situation. Being drunk might explain some behavior, but it's not an excuse for the actions taken.\n\nThe girlfriend caught him with her phone, leading to a big argument. The boyfriend is still holding onto the phone, which shows a lack of resolution and potentially more conflict. Trust is a crucial component in any relationship, and this action would likely damage that trust further.\n\nEven though the boyfriend felt justified due to the flirting, the method of addressing the issue was inappropriate. A better approach would have been to talk to his girlfriend directly about her interactions and express his concerns without invading her privacy. The fact that he took matters into his own hands by confronting the group publicly without discussing it with her first is problematic.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the boyfriend's actions were wrong because they involved a breach of privacy and an aggressive response. The answer should be A.\n"
