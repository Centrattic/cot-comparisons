They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for checking their girlfriend's phone. So the situation is that the girlfriend started hanging out a lot with high school friends, and the guy found out one of them is a guy. He went through her phone, saw obvious flirting messages, and then sent a message to the group chat confronting them. Now they're in a fight, and he's holding onto her phone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points here. The key issue is the act of going through her phone without permission. That's a big deal because it's a privacy violation. Even if he had feelings of jealousy or insecurity, accessing her phone without her consent is generally considered wrong. Privacy in relationships is important, and trust is a cornerstone. By checking her phone, he breached that trust. \n\nThen there's the part where he sent a message to the group chat while drunk. That action was public and confrontational, which might have escalated the situation. Even if the flirting was happening, how he addressed it could be seen as extreme. The girlfriend's perspective is also important here. She might feel that her privacy was invaded, and the public confrontation could have hurt her feelings or her friendships.\n\nAnother angle is the girlfriend's behavior. She was hanging out with these friends, and one of them was a guy who was flirting. That's part of the problem, but the solution shouldn't be invading her privacy. Relationships require communication. Instead of checking her phone, he should have talked to her about his concerns first. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's holding onto her phone now and not returning it adds another layer. That's a form of punishment and could be seen as controlling behavior. It's not solving the problem but rather creating more conflict.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the main issue is the unauthorized access to her phone. That's a violation of trust and privacy, which is a significant relationship issue. Even if his intentions were to protect the relationship, the method was wrong. The answer here would likely be A, that the author is in the wrong. But I should also consider if there's any nuance, like if the girlfriend was deceptive about her interactions. However, even if she was, the act of checking her phone without consent is still a problem. So the answer is A.\n"
