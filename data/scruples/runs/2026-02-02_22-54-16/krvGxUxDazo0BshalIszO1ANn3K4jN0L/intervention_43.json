They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for going through their girlfriend's phone. The situation involves the girlfriend hanging out with high school friends, including a guy. The author found out through the phone that this guy was flirting with her and then sent a message to the group chat. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Going through someone's phone without permission is a breach of privacy. Even if the motivation is jealousy or concern, it's generally considered wrong. Privacy is a big deal in relationships, and trust is crucial. The author's actions might have been driven by insecurity, but that doesn't justify invading their partner's privacy.\n\nThen there's the fact that the author was drunk when they sent the message. That could be a mitigating factor, but it's not an excuse. Acting on impulse while under the influence can lead to poor decisions. The argument that followed and the girlfriend being caught in the act probably caused more harm than good. \n\nThe author is now holding onto the phone, which is a form of retaliation. This could escalate the conflict. Even if there was flirting, confronting the issue directly with the girlfriend would have been a better approach. The act of checking the phone without permission sets a problematic precedent and can erode trust in the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions\u2014flirting in a group chat with another guy\u2014might be the root cause here. However, the solution isn't to invade her privacy. Healthy communication and addressing concerns openly are more constructive. The author's actions, while understandable from an emotional standpoint, are not ethically justified.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because invading privacy, even out of jealousy, is not acceptable. The right approach would have been to talk to the girlfriend about their feelings instead of checking her phone.\n"
