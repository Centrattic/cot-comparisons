They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who went through their girlfriend's phone is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend has been spending time with high school friends, including a guy. The author found out through the phone that there's flirting happening in a group chat, then sent a message to the group. They got into an argument, and now the author is holding onto the phone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main issue here. The key points are: accessing the phone without consent, the justification (flirting from the guy), and the reaction (sending a message to the group, being drunk).\n\nFrom a typical perspective, privacy is a big factor. Even if someone suspects infidelity or inappropriate behavior, going through the phone without permission is usually seen as a violation of trust and privacy. The author's action of checking the phone is the main problem here. While the guy in the group chat was flirting, the method of confronting it by using the phone without consent is questionable. The author might think they're acting in self-defense, but the act of reading the messages without permission is a breach of boundaries.\n\nThen there's the drunk part. Being under the influence might have affected their judgment, leading to an extreme reaction. However, the initial act of going through the phone is separate from the drunk message. The author might have had the right to be concerned, but the method wasn't appropriate.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is also important. If she didn't know the author was checking her phone, that's a lack of communication. The argument that followed suggests that both parties are upset, but the initial action is still on the author.\n\nIn many similar situations, experts and online communities often emphasize that while trust issues are valid, the means of addressing them must be respectful and consensual. So the author is likely in the wrong for checking the phone without consent, even if the underlying issue (the flirting) is valid. The reaction might also be seen as harsh, but the main issue is the unauthorized access to the phone.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because the act of going through the phone without permission is a breach of privacy, regardless of the reason. Even if the intentions were to confront flirting, the method was inappropriate.\n"
