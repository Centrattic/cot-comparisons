They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person (OP) went through their girlfriend's phone without permission. The girlfriend had been hanging out with high school friends, and OP found out one of them was a guy who was flirting with her. In a drunk state, OP checked her WhatsApp, saw the flirtatious messages, and then sent a message to the group chat to confront them. Now, the girlfriend caught OP with her phone, they argued, and OP is holding onto her phone.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the unauthorized access to the girlfriend's phone. Privacy is a big deal in relationships. Even if there were concerns about the girlfriend's behavior, going through her messages without her consent is a violation of trust and privacy. The fact that OP was drunk complicates things but doesn't excuse the action. Sending a message to the group chat was confrontational and could be seen as aggressive, especially when done without discussing the issue first.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is understandable because she might feel that her privacy was invaded. Even if there was flirting, the method OP chose was extreme and could escalate the situation. The key points here are consent, privacy, and communication. OP didn't address the issue directly with his girlfriend first, which is the healthier approach. Instead, he acted impulsively, which led to conflict. So, while the girlfriend's behavior might be questionable, OP's actions were inappropriate and invasive. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
