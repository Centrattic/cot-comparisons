They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nThe author's girlfriend has been spending a lot of time with her \"high school friends,\" including a recent reunion. Then, she continues to hang out with them every weekend. The author later finds out that one of these friends is a guy, which makes him uncomfortable. In a moment of jealousy, he takes her phone, checks her WhatsApp messages, discovers what he perceives as flirting, and then sends a message to the group chat confronting the guy, which leads to a big argument. Now, he's holding onto her phone, unsure whether to return it.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the act of going through the girlfriend's phone without her consent. Privacy is a significant concern in relationships. Even if there's suspicion or jealousy, accessing someone's private messages without permission is generally considered a violation of trust and privacy. It's a common point of contention in AITA stories. The author might feel justified because of the perceived flirtation, but the act itself is ethically questionable.\n\nThen there's the response he took\u2014sending a message to the group chat. He mentions he was a bit drunk, which might have influenced his actions. Confronting someone else's friend in a public group chat could be seen as aggressive or overstepping. It's possible the guy wasn't actually doing anything wrong, or maybe the flirtation wasn't mutual or intentional. The author's public confrontation could have embarrassed his girlfriend or the other person, leading to further conflict.\n\nThe aftermath is that they had a big argument, and the author is now keeping the phone. That's a power move and might escalate the situation. Holding onto someone's phone as a form of punishment is not a healthy resolution. It shows a lack of communication and understanding, focusing on control rather than addressing the underlying issues.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust and communication are key. Instead of snooping, the author should have addressed his concerns with his girlfriend directly. By acting impulsively, he damaged trust and caused more harm. The girlfriend might feel violated, and the argument might have been avoidable with honest conversation.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's behavior could be a red flag. If she's hiding the nature of her friendships or not being transparent, that's on her too. But the act of invading her privacy is still on the author. Even if there's a justification, the method was inappropriate.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's state of mind\u2014being drunk. While it's a mitigating factor, it doesn't excuse the behavior. People are responsible for their actions even when under the influence.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions\u2014snooping through the phone and public confrontation\u2014are the main issues. The justification based on jealousy doesn't negate the violation of privacy. The girlfriend's actions might have contributed, but the author's response was the direct cause of the argument. So, the answer is likely that he's in the wrong.\n"
