They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author checking their girlfriend's phone after finding out she was in a group chat with a guy who was flirting with her. The author then sent a message to the group chat confronting them, got in an argument, and is now holding onto her phone.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions are justified. The main issue here is going through the girlfriend's phone without her permission. That's a classic privacy violation. Even if there's a suspicion of wrongdoing, invading someone's privacy without their consent is generally considered wrong. So the act of going through her phone is a key point here.\n\nThen there's the part where the author sent a message to the group chat. The user says they were drunk, which might have influenced their decision-making. Whether the message was appropriate or extreme is another factor. Confronting someone in a public group chat can be seen as aggressive or confrontational, especially if done impulsively. The fact that they didn't discuss the issue directly with their girlfriend first is a problem. Communication is key in relationships, and reacting without talking to her first could have made things worse.\n\nThe girlfriend found out about the phone check, leading to an argument. The author is now withholding the phone, which adds to the conflict. Withholding property is a power move and can escalate the situation. It's not a healthy way to handle disagreements.\n\nSo, considering all these factors: invading privacy, lack of communication, confrontational actions, and holding onto the phone. The author's actions are problematic. Even if there were reasons to be upset, the way they handled it was wrong. The correct answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
