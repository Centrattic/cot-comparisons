They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author says they went through their girlfriend's phone because she's been hanging out with her high school friends, including a guy. They found a group chat where the guy was flirting, using terms like \"babe\" and \"darling.\" The author then sent a message to the group chat asserting that the girlfriend has a boyfriend and that she shouldn't go out with them if he's there. They were drunk and maybe did something extreme. The girlfriend found out, there was a big argument, and now the author is keeping her phone, unsure if they want to return it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is going through someone's phone without permission. That's a common problem in relationships. Privacy is a big part of any healthy relationship, right? So invading someone's privacy by checking their phone without consent is generally considered a breach of trust. Even if there's a reason, like jealousy or suspicion, it's still a violation.\n\nThen there's the action taken in the group chat. The author confronted the guy directly in a public forum, which might have been harsh. But even if the content of the message was justified, the method of confrontation could be problematic. The author might have escalated the situation instead of addressing it privately with the girlfriend first.\n\nAlso, the fact that they were drunk when they did this is a factor. Being under the influence can lead to poor judgment and impulsive actions. However, that's not a complete excuse, especially if the action itself is inherently wrong.\n\nAnother angle is the girlfriend's reaction. She caught him with her phone, leading to a big argument. This suggests that she was not okay with the invasion of her privacy. The author is now holding onto her phone, which might be a power play or an attempt to get her to apologize, but that's not healthy either.\n\nI should also think about the justification. The author felt the need to protect their relationship by confronting the guy. However, the appropriate way would be to talk to the girlfriend first, express their concerns, and not snoop. Trust is important, and if there's a breakdown in communication, that's the root issue, not the act of checking the phone.\n\nLegally, in many places, there's no law against checking a partner's phone if they live together, but ethically, it's a different story. Social norms and relationship ethics usually frown upon such actions.\n\nSo putting it all together: The author violated their girlfriend's privacy, acted impulsively, and used a public confrontation which might have been harsh. Even if the intent was to protect the relationship, the method was wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
