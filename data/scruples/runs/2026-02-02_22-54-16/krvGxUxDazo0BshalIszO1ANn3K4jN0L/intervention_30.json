They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for going through their girlfriend's phone and then sending a message to a group chat. The situation involves the girlfriend hanging out with friends, including a guy, and the author's actions in response to perceived flirting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author took the girlfriend's phone without permission and read her WhatsApp messages. That's a clear privacy violation. Even if they were concerned about their partner's actions, accessing someone's phone without consent is generally considered a breach of trust and privacy. \n\nThen, the author sent a message to the group chat, which was confrontational. The girlfriend found out, leading to an argument. The author admitted to being drunk and maybe acting too harshly. But the main issue is the initial act of going through the phone. \n\nEven if the author felt jealous or insecure, the method they used was invasive. Trust is a fundamental part of a relationship, and snooping through someone's phone undermines that. The girlfriend might feel disrespected and betrayed. \n\nAlso, the author is now keeping the phone, which adds another layer of conflict. The act of not returning a personal item is further escalation. \n\nSo, while the author might have had feelings of jealousy, the actions taken were inappropriate. The right approach would have been to communicate their concerns to the girlfriend directly instead of invading her privacy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
