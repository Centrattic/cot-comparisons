They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for going through their girlfriend's phone. \n\nFirst, the main issue is the act of checking her phone without permission. That's a big red flag in relationships. Privacy is important, and invading someone's privacy can erode trust. The author did this out of jealousy, which is understandable but not a valid excuse for the action. \n\nThen there's the part where they sent a message to the group chat. Even if the flirting was happening, confronting it publicly, especially when drunk, is a poor choice. It could escalate the situation and come off as controlling or aggressive. The girlfriend's reaction leading to a big argument makes sense because she probably felt disrespected and her privacy violated.\n\nThe author is holding onto her phone, which is a form of retaliation and not a healthy way to handle conflict. This shows a lack of communication and a tendency to act out of anger rather than addressing the issue calmly.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend might also have some responsibility. If she was indeed flirting, that's a problem in the relationship. But the way the author handled it was problematic. The key here is the method of dealing with the issue. Even if there were legitimate concerns, the approach taken was wrong.\n\nIn relationships, communication and trust are crucial. Instead of spying, the author should have talked to his girlfriend about his feelings. The act of checking the phone and then publicly shaming the group chat is a breach of trust and respect, which is a major issue. \n\nSo, while there might be some justification for being upset about the flirting, the actions taken are what make the author at fault. The right approach would be to express concerns respectfully, not through invasion of privacy or public confrontation when intoxicated.\n"
