They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the person went through their girlfriend's phone. They found out the girlfriend was hanging out with her high school friends, including a guy who was flirting with her. The author then sent a message to the group chat to confront them, leading to an argument and keeping the girlfriend's phone. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nLet me think about the key points. Privacy is a big factor here. Going through someone's phone without permission is generally seen as a violation of trust and privacy. Even if there were reasons, like suspecting infidelity or feeling insecure, the method used is problematic. The author's actions were unauthorized, which is a red flag in relationships.\n\nThen there's the reaction part. The author was drunk and sent a message to the group chat. That's confrontational and could escalate the situation. Using the girlfriend's phone to do so is another breach of trust. Holding onto the phone after the argument adds to the conflict, as it's a form of withholding something personal.\n\nFrom a relationship advice perspective, most would say that privacy violations are serious. Even if there were valid concerns, the way the author addressed them was inappropriate. The right approach would be to communicate openly with the girlfriend, express feelings, and address the issue without invading her privacy. The action itself undermines trust, which is crucial in a relationship.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong. They violated privacy, acted impulsively, and didn't handle the situation constructively. Even if the motive was jealousy or insecurity, the method used was harmful and untrustworthy.\n"
