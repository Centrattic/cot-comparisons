They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves checking their girlfriend's phone without permission and then confronting the group chat. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the act of going through someone's phone. That's a classic no-no in relationships. Trust is important, and invading someone's privacy like that usually isn't justified, even if there are suspicions. The person might feel insecure or jealous, but breaking into the phone is a breach of trust.\n\nThen there's the response they took: sending a message to the group chat while drunk. That seems impulsive and could be seen as aggressive. Even if the guy in the group chat was flirting, the way the author handled it might have escalated things unnecessarily.\n\nThe girlfriend caught them with her phone, leading to a big argument. The author is now holding onto her phone, which is a power move and might be trying to punish her. That doesn't sound healthy.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the key points are privacy violation, acting out of jealousy, and using the phone as leverage. Most people would say that the author overstepped by checking her phone without consent. Even if there's a valid reason (like the guy flirting), the method was wrong. Relationships require communication and trust, not spying and confrontation without talking first. The answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
