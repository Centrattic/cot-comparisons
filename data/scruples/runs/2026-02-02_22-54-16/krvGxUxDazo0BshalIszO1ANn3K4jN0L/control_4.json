They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who went through their girlfriend's phone is in the wrong. The situation involves checking WhatsApp messages after finding out the girlfriend is hanging out with someone who's flirting with her.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is privacy. Going through someone's phone without consent is a clear invasion of privacy, regardless of the reason. Even if there's suspicion of infidelity or inappropriate behavior, the method of checking without permission is problematic. Trust and communication are key in relationships, and resorting to snooping can erode that trust.\n\nThe author mentions they were drunk when they sent the message to the group chat. Intoxication might explain the impulsiveness, but it doesn't justify the initial act of checking the phone. The fact that they still have the phone and are considering not returning it adds to the conflict. Holding onto her belongings could be seen as a power move, which escalates the situation negatively.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction leading to a big argument and the author leaving alone suggests that their actions have already caused significant harm to the relationship. The justification based on the guy's flirtatious messages doesn't absolve the author of wrongdoing. It's important to handle such issues through open dialogue and mutual respect, not by violating privacy.\n\nIn many relationships, trust is foundational. If there's a lack of trust leading to snooping, it indicates deeper issues that need addressing. The appropriate course of action would be to communicate concerns directly with the partner rather than taking matters into one's own hands. So, while the author might feel justified, the act of invading privacy without consent is indeed wrong.\n"
