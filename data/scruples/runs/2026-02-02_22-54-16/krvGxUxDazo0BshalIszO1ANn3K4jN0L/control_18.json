They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about checking their girlfriend's phone and then confronting the guy she was flirting with. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author went through the girlfriend's phone without permission because they found out she was hanging out with a guy who was flirting with her. The author then sent a message to the group chat, which was a bit extreme, especially since they were drunk. Now they're holding onto the phone and not sure if they should return it.\n\nThe main issues here are privacy and trust. Going through someone's phone without their consent is a big no-no. Even if there's jealousy or suspicion, invading privacy like that isn't justified. The author's actions were a violation of trust, regardless of the reason. Then, sending a message to the group chat when drunk might have been an overreaction. The girlfriend was upset, and the argument that followed probably made things worse.\n\nBut wait, the guy was flirting. Does that excuse the author's actions? No, because the right approach would have been to talk to the girlfriend first instead of checking her phone. The author's decision to confront the group chat directly without discussing it with the girlfriend shows a lack of communication and trust in the relationship.\n\nAlso, holding onto the phone after the argument is another problem. That's not just, even if they feel wronged. Taking the phone as a form of punishment or control isn't healthy. The author might be trying to assert power here, which isn't the way to handle conflicts.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author's actions\u2014checking the phone and then the public confrontation\u2014were wrong. They broke trust, acted without communication, and overstepped boundaries. Even if there was a valid reason (the flirting), the method used was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer should be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
