They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the message is in the wrong. The situation is about checking a girlfriend's phone and then confronting her via a group chat after seeing flirtatious messages.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the act of going through her phone without permission. That's a clear invasion of privacy. Even if there were concerns about her interactions, sneaking into her phone isn't a respectful action. Trust is a big part of relationships, and this action might break that trust.\n\nThen there's the part where he sent a message to the group chat. He was drunk, which might have influenced his judgment, but that doesn't excuse the behavior. Publicly shaming her in front of others could be hurtful. The argument they had probably made things worse, and him keeping her phone even after shows he might not be taking responsibility for his actions.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is understandable too. Being caught in the act of privacy invasion would lead to anger and a big argument. The fact that he's considering not returning the phone adds another layer of conflict.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of secretly checking her messages, a better approach would have been to talk to her about his concerns. His actions were reactive and potentially harmful, which makes me think he's in the wrong here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because he violated her privacy and reacted in a way that could be considered controlling and disrespectful.\n"
