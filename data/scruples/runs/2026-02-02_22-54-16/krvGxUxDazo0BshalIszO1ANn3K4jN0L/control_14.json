They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend going out with high school friends, and the author checked her phone. He found out one of the friends was a guy and they were flirting. Then he sent a message to the group chat when he was drunk, which caused an argument.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is whether going through someone's phone is justified. Generally, checking a partner's phone without consent is considered a violation of privacy. Even if there's suspicion or jealousy, it's not a valid reason to invade their privacy. The author's actions were secretive and possibly overreacted, especially since he was drunk when he sent the message. That could make his actions more impulsive and less rational.\n\nAlso, the author is holding onto her phone, which is a sign of escalating the conflict rather than resolving it. Open communication is key in relationships, so instead of sneaking around, discussing his concerns with her would have been a better approach. The fact that there was a big argument suggests that the method used was not appropriate. \n\nThe boyfriend's justification is based on jealousy, but that doesn't excuse the breach of trust. Trust is important in a relationship, and invading someone's privacy undermines that. The author's actions might have been driven by valid concerns, but the way he handled it was wrong. So the answer should be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
