They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves checking a girlfriend's phone without her knowledge, finding a flirtatious group chat, and then confronting them publicly, which led to an argument.\n\nFirst, invading someone's privacy by checking their phone without consent is a major issue. Trust is crucial in relationships, and this action breaches that trust. Even if there were reasons to feel jealous, the method used here\u2014secretly reading messages\u2014is problematic. \n\nThe author then took it a step further by publicly confronting the group, which could be seen as harsh. While the content of the messages might have justified some concern, the approach here was confrontational and public, which isn't the healthiest way to handle such situations. \n\nBeing drunk might have influenced their actions, making them more impulsive. The fact that they still have the phone and are considering not returning it shows a lack of willingness to resolve the issue respectfully. \n\nSo, even though there's understandable jealousy, the actions taken (privacy violation, public confrontation) are generally considered wrong in a healthy relationship. The right approach would have been to communicate concerns directly with the girlfriend, not to act on them without discussion.\n"
