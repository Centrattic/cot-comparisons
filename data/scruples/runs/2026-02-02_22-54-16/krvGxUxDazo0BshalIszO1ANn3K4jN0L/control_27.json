They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for going through their girlfriend's phone and then confronting the group chat. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend has been spending a lot of time with her high school friends, including a guy. The author discovered a group chat where the guy was flirting, so they sent a message to the group. The key points here are the invasion of privacy by checking the phone and the public confrontation.\n\nPrivacy is a big factor. Even if the girlfriend was in the wrong, going through her phone without permission is a violation of trust and privacy. Relationships require mutual respect, and snooping isn't healthy. Then there's the action of sending a message to the group chat. That's pretty confrontational and could be seen as overstepping, especially when drunk. \n\nThe author admits to being drunk and maybe acting too harshly. The girlfriend caught him, leading to a big argument. The fact that he's holding onto her phone now shows a possible escalation. Even if the girl was being flirty, the author's method of handling it was problematic. \n\nSo, while the girlfriend's behavior might be questionable, the author's actions\u2014invading privacy and public shaming\u2014are definitely on the wrong side. The right approach would have been to talk to her directly about the issue instead of taking matters into his own hands through her phone and the group chat.\n"
