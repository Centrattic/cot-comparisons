They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for going through their girlfriend's phone. The situation involves the girlfriend hanging out with friends, one of whom is a guy. The author checked her messages, found flirting, and then publicly called them out in a group chat while drunk. Now, the girlfriend is upset, there was a big argument, and the author is still holding onto her phone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points here. The key actions are: going through her phone without permission, sending a message to the group chat, and keeping her phone. \n\nThe first thing that comes to mind is that privacy is a big factor. Even in a relationship, people expect their personal information to be respected. Going through someone's phone without their consent is a breach of trust. It's a common issue in relationships and often seen as a violation of privacy. So, that part is probably wrong.\n\nThen there's the action of sending a message to the group chat. The author was drunk, which might have influenced their judgment, but that doesn't make it right. Publicly shaming or confronting someone in a group chat could be seen as escalation. Even if there was a reason, the method was harsh. It's better to address such issues privately and calmly, not in a public forum, especially when emotions are high from being drunk.\n\nAnother point is the aftermath. The girlfriend caught him with her phone, leading to a big argument. The fact that he's holding onto her phone now suggests he might be using it as a bargaining chip, which isn't healthy. Relationships should be built on mutual respect and communication, not holding onto someone's belongings as a sign of control or punishment.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend was spending time with a guy she was flirting with. That's a red flag, and the author's feelings of jealousy are understandable. However, the way he handled it was problematic. Trust is important, but not at the expense of respecting each other's privacy and autonomy.\n\nIn many cases like this, experts would say that invading someone's privacy is a significant breach. The author's actions, while stemming from hurt, are not justified because they undermine trust and respect. The best approach would have been to talk to her directly after noticing the behavior, rather than snooping and then making a public scene.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is in the wrong for violating her privacy, acting impulsively while drunk, and not handling the situation with the proper communication. The answer should be A."
