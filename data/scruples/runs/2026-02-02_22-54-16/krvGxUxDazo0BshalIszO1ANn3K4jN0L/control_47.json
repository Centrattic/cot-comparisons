They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for going through their girlfriend's phone. So first, I need to analyze the situation. The girlfriend has been hanging out a lot with high school friends, and one of them is a guy. The author found out by checking her phone and saw flirting messages. Then they sent a message to the group chat, which led to an argument.\n\nThe main issue here is whether going through someone's phone is acceptable. Generally, privacy is a big deal in relationships. Even if there's suspicion of something wrong, invading someone's privacy without consent is usually seen as wrong. The author's actions might have been a reaction to jealousy, but that doesn't make it right. Trust is important, and checking a partner's phone can break that trust. Also, the author admits to being drunk, which might have influenced their judgment. \n\nAnother angle is the response they took. Sending a message to the group chat in a confrontational way could be seen as overstepping, even if they found evidence of flirting. However, the fact that there was actual flirting might make people feel the author had a reason. But the method of handling it (without discussing it directly with the girlfriend first) is problematic. \n\nSo, putting it all together, even though there might be some justification for the author's actions, the act of going through the phone without consent is a breach of privacy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
