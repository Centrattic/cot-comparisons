They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for going through their girlfriend's phone. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The main points are: the girlfriend has been hanging out a lot with friends, including a guy. The author found out by checking her phone, saw flirtatious messages, then confronted the group chat, got into an argument, and is now keeping her phone.\n\nThe key issue here is privacy and trust. Checking someone's phone without permission is a clear invasion of privacy. Even if there's jealousy involved, the right approach would be to talk to the girlfriend first instead of snooping. The author's actions\u2014using her phone without consent and sending a message to the group chat\u2014could be seen as overreacting and not addressing the issue maturely. \n\nAlso, keeping her phone now adds to the conflict. Relationships require trust and communication. Instead of secretly checking her messages, the author should have expressed their concerns directly with the girlfriend. The fact that he was drunk when he acted might be a mitigating factor, but it doesn't excuse the behavior. \n\nSo, even if there were valid concerns about the friend being a guy, the method used was wrong. The answer is probably that the author is in the wrong (A)."
