They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves checking their girlfriend's phone without permission and then confronting the friends in a group chat.\n\nFirst, the main issue is privacy. Going through someone's phone without consent is a big no-no. Even if there's suspicion of something wrong, respecting boundaries is crucial. The author did this secretly, which is a breach of trust.\n\nThen there's the part where they sent a message to the group chat. That's pretty aggressive and public, which could be embarrassing for the girlfriend. Even if the guy was flirting, the author's method of handling it was confrontational and not a private discussion. Plus, being drunk might have made them act more impulsively.\n\nThe argument that followed and the refusal to return the phone show that the author is holding onto this issue, which might not help in resolving the problem. Relationships require communication and trust, and the author's actions damaged both.\n\nSo, even though they might have felt jealous or insecure, the actions taken were not justified. The answer should be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
