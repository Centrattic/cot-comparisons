They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves checking their girlfriend's phone, finding a group chat with a guy who's flirting, and then sending a message to the group chat. \n\nFirst, invading someone's privacy by checking their phone without permission is generally considered wrong. Even if there's a reason, like jealousy, the method of confronting the issue by publicly calling out the guy in a group chat might be seen as overstepping. The author was drunk and maybe acted impulsively, which could mitigate some responsibility but doesn't excuse the actions entirely.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction makes sense because privacy is important in relationships. Trust and communication are key. Instead of going through her phone, the author should have talked to her about the concerns first. Taking her phone and not returning it could escalate the conflict further.\n\nSo, while the author might feel justified due to the flirting, the actions taken (snooping and public confrontation) are problematic. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
