They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who went through their girlfriend's phone is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend hanging out with high school friends, including a guy she recently admitted to being with. The author took her phone, checked messages, and then sent a message to the group chat. Now they're holding onto the phone and are conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue here is privacy violation. Checking someone's phone without their consent is a big no-no in relationships. Even if there's jealousy or suspicion, invading someone's privacy without a conversation first is problematic. The author's actions might have been driven by feelings of insecurity or mistrust, but the method used was extreme. \n\nThen there's the drunk factor. Acting under the influence can lead to poor decisions, which the author acknowledges. However, that doesn't excuse the action entirely but might show it wasn't entirely rational. The response of sending a message to the group chat was public and confrontational, which could have escalated the situation instead of addressing it privately.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also a point. She caught him with her phone, leading to a big argument. The fact that he's keeping the phone now shows a lack of resolution and possibly more conflict. Trust is crucial in a relationship, and this action would likely erode it further.\n\nAnother angle is consent. The author didn't talk to his girlfriend about his concerns first. Open communication is usually the healthier approach. Instead, he took matters into his own hands, which is why many would say he's in the wrong. Even if there were valid concerns, the method of addressing them was inappropriate.\n\nSo putting it all together, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong). The act of going through her phone without permission violates trust and privacy. The response was overly aggressive and public, which didn't resolve the issue but created more problems. Even if the flirting was happening, the approach taken was not the right way to handle it.\n"
