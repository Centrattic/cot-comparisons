They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for going through their girlfriend's phone. The situation involves the girlfriend hanging out with high school friends, including a guy, and the author checking her messages, then confronting them in a group chat while drunk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author took the phone without permission, which is a violation of privacy. Even if the motivation was jealousy, the action itself isn't justified. Privacy is important in any relationship, and assuming the right to check someone's phone without consent is a breach of trust. \n\nThen there's the part where the author sent a message to the group chat. That's public shaming and could be seen as aggressive, especially when drunk. It might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. The girlfriend was upset and the argument happened because of the phone incident. \n\nHowever, the author's intention was to protect the relationship. They felt the flirting was obvious, but that doesn't mean the method was right. Trust and communication are key. Instead of invading privacy, discussing the concerns directly with the girlfriend would have been better. \n\nSo, while the author's feelings of jealousy might be understandable, the actions taken were wrong. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong. They violated privacy and acted in a way that could harm the relationship further.\n"
