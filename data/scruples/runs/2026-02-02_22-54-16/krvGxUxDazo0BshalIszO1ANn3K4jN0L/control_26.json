They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person went through their girlfriend's phone and sent a message to a group chat where she was flirting with someone else. The main issue here is the invasion of privacy. Checking someone's phone without their consent is a big no-no. Even if the person felt jealous or insecure, the right approach would have been to communicate openly with the girlfriend instead of snooping around. The fact that they were drunk when they sent the message adds another layer of judgment, as decisions made under the influence can cloud better reasoning. The author's actions might have been intended to address the flirting, but the method was wrong. Relationships require trust and communication, not surveillance. So, the answer is A\u2014yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
