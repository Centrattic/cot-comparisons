They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves checking their girlfriend's phone without permission, finding a group chat with a guy who's flirting, and then confronting them by sending a message. They also mention not returning the phone yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Privacy is a big deal. Even in a relationship, individuals have a right to their privacy. The author took the phone without consent, which is a breach of trust. Then, they read messages and sent a message publicly in a group chat. That's pretty invasive and could be seen as overreacting, especially since they were drunk. \n\nThe girlfriend might feel violated, leading to a big argument. The author's actions, while possibly motivated by jealousy, are not justified by the circumstances. Even if there was flirting, confronting the group chat in that way might escalate the situation unnecessarily. \n\nAlso, holding onto the phone after the argument isn't helping. It's a power move that can damage the relationship further. Legally, there's no issue in checking a partner's phone, but ethically, it's a no-go. So the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
