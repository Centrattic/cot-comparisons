They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who went through their girlfriend's phone is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend started hanging out more with high school friends, and the guy finds out one of them is a guy who's flirting. The guy then checks her phone, reads the messages, and sends a message to the group chat when he's drunk. Now he's holding onto her phone and not sure if he should return it.\n\nFirst, invading someone's privacy by checking their phone without permission is generally considered a breach of trust. Even if there's suspicion of wrongdoing, the method of confronting it matters. The guy's actions were unauthorized, which can be seen as disrespectful. Also, sending a message in a group chat while drunk might escalate the situation unnecessarily. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable because privacy is important in relationships. While the guy might feel betrayed, the right approach would be to communicate openly instead of acting impulsively. Holding onto the phone after the argument doesn't help either. So, the person is in the wrong for violating privacy and handling the situation poorly.\n"
