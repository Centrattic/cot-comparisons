They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for going through their girlfriend's phone. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author's girlfriend has been spending a lot of time with her high school friends, including a guy. The author found out about this guy and discovered he was flirting with her. In a drunken state, the author read her WhatsApp messages and then sent a message to the group chat asserting that she has a boyfriend and that she won't hang out with them if the guy is there. Now, the author is holding onto her phone after an argument.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate this. Let's consider the key points. The main issue is the act of going through the girlfriend's phone without permission. That's a privacy violation. Even if the author had concerns about the relationship, accessing her phone without consent is generally considered a breach of trust. Privacy is important in relationships, and snooping can be seen as disrespectful.\n\nThen, the author's response was to confront the group in a public way. While the intention might have been to protect the relationship, the method was confrontational and possibly embarrassing. Sending a message in a group chat like that could escalate the situation and might not be the best approach. The drunkenness might mitigate some responsibility, but it's still an action with consequences.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction leading to a big argument and the author keeping her phone adds more tension. Holding onto her phone after the argument is another issue, as it's not a constructive resolution. It could be seen as holding a grudge or trying to exert control.\n\nSo, even though the author had valid concerns about their girlfriend's interactions, the methods used were problematic. The right approach would involve communication and trust rather than invading privacy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for going through the phone and the subsequent actions. The answer should be A.\n"
