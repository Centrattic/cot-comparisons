They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for going through their girlfriend's phone. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been hanging out a lot with her high school friends, and the author found out one of them is a guy. Then, the author took her phone without permission and read WhatsApp messages. The guy in the group chat was flirting with her using terms like \"babe\" and \"darling.\" The author then sent a message to the group chat, mentioning her having a boyfriend and saying she shouldn't go out with them if the guy is there. The author was drunk, which might have influenced their actions. The girlfriend caught them with her phone, leading to an argument, and the author is now considering not returning it.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether going through someone's phone is justified. Generally, privacy is a big deal in relationships. Even if there are suspicions, invading someone's privacy without talking to them first can be problematic. The author didn't confront the girlfriend directly about the guy; instead, they checked her phone and then acted impulsively. That might have been a breach of trust. Also, sending a message to the group chat in her name without her consent is another issue. Even if the content was a reprimand, doing it via her phone without her permission is a privacy violation.\n\nThe argument is that the author might have felt the need to act because of the flirting, but the method\u2014without communication or consent\u2014is questionable. The fact that the author was drunk might make their actions more careless, though that doesn't necessarily justify them. The girlfriend's reaction (a big argument and not wanting to return the phone) suggests that the author overstepped, which is a common response when someone's privacy is invaded.\n\nIn most contexts, privacy and trust are important. Even if the author's intentions were to address the situation, the approach lacks respect for the girlfriend's boundaries. So, the answer is likely A for Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
