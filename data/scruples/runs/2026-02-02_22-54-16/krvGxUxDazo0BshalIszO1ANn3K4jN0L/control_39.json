They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for checking their girlfriend's phone.\n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend has been hanging out a lot with her high school friends, including a guy. The author went through her phone without consent and found what they considered flirting messages. Then they publicly called out the guy in a group chat, leading to an argument.\n\nSo, the main issues here are privacy and trust. The author accessed the girlfriend's phone without her permission. In most relationships, checking a partner's phone without their knowledge is a breach of trust and privacy, regardless of the reason. Even if the author felt jealous or concerned, the method they chose was invasive. \n\nThey mention being a little drunk, which might have influenced their actions, but that doesn't make it right. The argument that the author had a \"good reason\" because of the perceived flirting doesn't justify the violation of privacy. Healthy relationships require communication rather than surveillance. \n\nAlso, the author is holding onto the phone now, which seems like a form of punishment and could escalate the conflict. This behavior might lead to more resentment and issues in the relationship. \n\nSo, even if the author's intentions were to protect the relationship, their actions were problematic. The right approach would have been to talk to their girlfriend about their feelings and concerns directly, not to snoop and then confront others publicly. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong for violating their partner's privacy and handling the situation in a confrontational way.\n"
