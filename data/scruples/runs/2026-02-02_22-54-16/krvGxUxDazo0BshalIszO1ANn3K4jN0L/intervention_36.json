They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who went through their girlfriend's phone is in the wrong. The scenario is that the boyfriend found out the girlfriend was hanging out a lot with her high school friends, including a guy, and he went through her phone. He discovered flirting in a group chat and then sent a message to the group chat to assert his presence as her boyfriend. Now, he's holding onto her phone after a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is whether going through her phone without her consent is justified. Privacy is a big factor here. Even in relationships, people generally have the right to their privacy. Checking someone's phone without permission is a breach of that trust. The boyfriend's action of going through her phone might be seen as a violation, regardless of his intentions.\n\nHowever, the context is that he felt jealous because she was spending time with a guy who was flirting with her. The group chat had clear signs of flirting, like \"babe\" and \"darling.\" His reaction was to confront the group, which might have been a bit extreme, especially when he was drunk. But he did act out of concern and to protect the relationship.\n\nNow, I have to weigh the breach of privacy against the justification of protecting the relationship. Even if there's a valid reason, the method of checking the phone without consent is problematic. Trust and communication are essential in relationships. Instead of invading her privacy, he should have talked to her about his concerns first. By not doing so, he undermined the trust, which could lead to more significant issues.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's holding onto her phone now shows that he's using the situation to his advantage, which isn't a good look. It's a form of punishment and doesn't resolve the underlying issues. The right approach would involve open communication and addressing the problem together, not through surveillance or threats.\n\nIn many ethical perspectives, respecting someone's privacy is crucial, even in a relationship. While his intentions might be to protect the relationship, the means he used are unethical. The consequence of his actions is that he damaged trust and caused an argument. So, even though he had reasons, the method was wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong. The breach of privacy isn't justified by the situation, and there are better ways to handle jealousy and concerns in a relationship.\n"
