They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves checking the girlfriend's phone and then confronting the group chat.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The main issue is about privacy. The author took the girlfriend's phone without permission and read her messages. Even though there's a reason (her hanging out with friends, one of whom is a guy and flirting), the act of going through the phone without consent is a breach of privacy. That's a big no-no regardless of the circumstances.\n\nThen there's the part where he sent a message to the group chat. He was drunk, which might have influenced his judgment. Confronting the group directly in a public way could be seen as extreme, even if he felt threatened. The girlfriend caught him, leading to an argument, and he's now keeping her phone, which adds to the problem. Not returning the phone is another violation, escalating the conflict.\n\nEven if the flirting was happening, the method he used to address it was inappropriate. Trust and communication are key in relationships. Instead of spying, he should have talked to her about his concerns. His actions likely caused more harm than good, damaging trust and creating resentment. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the act of checking her phone without consent, the public confrontation, and withholding her phone all point to the author being in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
