They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about going through their girlfriend's phone. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author found out their girlfriend has been hanging out with her high school friends, including a guy. They went into her phone, saw messages where the guy was flirting, then sent a message to the group chat. Now they're holding onto her phone and are unsure if they should return it.\n\nSo, the main issue here is privacy. Going through someone's phone without their consent is generally considered a violation of trust and privacy. Even if there's suspicion of infidelity or inappropriate behavior, the method of handling it matters. The author's actions were invasive and confrontational, especially after a night of drinking, which might have made things worse. \n\nThe girlfriend reacted by arguing, which is a normal response to having her privacy invaded. The fact that they had a big argument and the author is still holding onto her phone suggests that trust is broken. The author might feel justified because of the flirting, but the way they handled it\u2014reading messages without permission and publicly confronting the group\u2014is problematic. \n\nEthically, respecting someone's privacy is important in a relationship. Even if there's jealousy, the right approach would be to communicate concerns directly with the girlfriend first, not through spying. The author's actions could be seen as controlling and disrespectful, which is why the answer is likely A (they are in the wrong). \n\nBut wait, maybe there's a cultural context where such actions are seen as protective. However, in most modern relationships, privacy is expected, and invading it without discussion is usually frowned upon. The author's justification might not outweigh the violation of trust here. So, I think the answer is A.\n"
