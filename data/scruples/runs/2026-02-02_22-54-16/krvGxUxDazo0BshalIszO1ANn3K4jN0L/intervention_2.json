They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went through their girlfriend's phone after finding out she's been hanging out a lot with high school friends, one of whom is a guy. The author then checked her WhatsApp messages and found flirtatious messages. They sent a message in the group chat to address the guy, got into an argument, and kept the phone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions taken. Going through someone's phone without their consent is generally considered a violation of privacy. Even if there's a valid reason, like suspicion of flirting, the method used is questionable. The author might have felt jealous or insecure, but the way they handled it\u2014without discussing it with their girlfriend first\u2014could be seen as overstepping. \n\nThen there's the part where they sent a message in the group chat while drunk. That's probably not the best way to handle the situation. Confronting the guy publicly might have escalated things unnecessarily. Also, keeping the phone afterward as leverage seems like a bad move because it's not resolving the issue and could cause more conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend was spending a lot of time with a guy, and the flirtation was obvious. The author's actions might stem from valid concerns about the relationship. However, trust and communication are crucial in relationships. Instead of sneaking around, maybe a better approach would have been to talk to the girlfriend first about the concerns and how she's spending her time.\n\nThe drunk factor is mentioned, which might explain some impulsiveness but doesn't excuse the behavior. The argument that followed likely made things worse. The key points here are privacy violation, lack of communication, and impulsive actions. \n\nSo, while the author had reasons to be upset, their methods were problematic. Therefore, they are likely in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
