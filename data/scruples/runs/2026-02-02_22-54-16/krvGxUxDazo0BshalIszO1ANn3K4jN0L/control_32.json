They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves going through their girlfriend's phone and then confronting her via a group chat. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points. The author found out their girlfriend was hanging out a lot with her high school friends, and when they discovered one was a guy, they checked her phone. They read WhatsApp messages where the guy was flirting, using terms like \"babe\" and \"darling.\" The author then sent a message to the group chat, possibly drunk, stating that she has a boyfriend and that she can't go out with them if he's there. The girlfriend caught them with the phone, leading to a big argument, and the author is considering keeping the phone.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn relationships, privacy is important. Going through someone's phone without permission is generally considered a violation of trust. Even if there's suspicion of flirting, the act of checking the phone without consent is problematic. The author's response of sending a message in the group chat could be seen as confrontational and possibly overreacting, especially if they were drunk. However, the girlfriend's actions of hanging out with someone who was flirting might also be an issue.\n\nBut the main issue here is the act of invading privacy. Even if the author had reasons, the method of handling it was inappropriate. So, the answer would likely be A. The author is in the wrong for going through the phone and public confrontation, regardless of the provocation. Trust and communication are key, and the author's actions undermined that.\n"
