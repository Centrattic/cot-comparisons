They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the person went through their girlfriend's phone after finding out she was hanging out with high school friends, including a guy. They saw the guy was flirting, got drunk, and sent a message to the group chat. Now they're holding onto her phone and the relationship is in trouble.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but I need to analyze it. Let's start with the act of going through the phone. Privacy is a big issue here. Even in a relationship, someone's phone is private. Checking messages without consent is a breach of trust. The girlfriend might feel violated, which can damage the relationship.\n\nThen there's the public shaming in the group chat. The author sent a message to the group, which is pretty extreme. It's not just confronting the guy privately but doing it in front of everyone. That's likely to escalate things and make the girlfriend feel embarrassed or attacked in front of her friends.\n\nThe author was drunk when they did this. While that might explain some of the actions, it's not an excuse. Acting on impulse when intoxicated can lead to poor decisions, but the responsibility still lies with the person. They should have waited until sober to address the issue.\n\nThe author is now keeping the phone as leverage. That's another problem. Holding onto someone's belongings to get revenge or make a point is not healthy. It can lead to further conflict and mistrust.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend was hanging out a lot with these friends, including a guy who was flirting. The author might have felt insecure or jealous. But the way they handled it\u2014invading privacy and public confrontation\u2014was wrong. Healthy relationships require communication and trust. Instead of sneaking around, they should have talked to the girlfriend about their concerns directly.\n\nSo even if the situation was irritating, the methods used were inappropriate. The author's actions violated the girlfriend's privacy and escalated the situation unnecessarily. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
