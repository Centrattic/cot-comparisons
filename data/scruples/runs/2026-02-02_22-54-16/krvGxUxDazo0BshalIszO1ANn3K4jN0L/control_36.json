They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for checking their girlfriend's phone and then confronting her in a group chat. So, I need to analyze the situation from different angles.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the act of going through someone's phone without permission. That's a classic invasion of privacy. Even in a relationship, people usually expect a certain level of privacy. The author admits to taking the phone from her bag and reading her WhatsApp messages. That's a breach of trust right there.\n\nThen, there's the part where the author found the guy flirting with his girlfriend. The guy was using terms like \"babe\" and \"darling,\" which are pretty clear signs of flirtation. The author's reaction was to message the group chat to confront them, which might have been impulsive, especially since he was drunk. Confronting the situation publicly could be seen as harsh, but the justification is that his girlfriend was being flirted with. However, the method of handling it might have been extreme, like sending a message to the group, which could have made the situation worse.\n\nThe author also mentions keeping the phone and not wanting to return it. That's another red flag. Holding onto someone's belongings as leverage isn't a healthy way to handle a disagreement. It can escalate the conflict and show a lack of respect for her property and autonomy.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's perspective: she went out with her high school friends, which might include a guy. Even if he was flirting, it's her choice to interact with her friends, and the author's response was to snoop and then publicly confront her. That might make her feel disrespected and violated. Trust in a relationship is built on mutual respect, and snooping undermines that.\n\nBut there's a counter-argument: maybe the author was hurt and felt the need to protect his relationship. Jealousy is a common emotion, but acting on it without communication can lead to problems. The right approach would have been to talk to his girlfriend about his feelings instead of going through her phone. The author's actions were reactive and not based on open communication, which is a key part of a healthy relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together: invading privacy by checking the phone is wrong. Confronting in a group chat, especially while drunk, is unwise. Not returning the phone adds to the conflict. The author's actions, while possibly motivated by jealousy, are not justified because they breach trust and privacy. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
