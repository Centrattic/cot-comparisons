They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend who's been spending a lot of time with her high school friends, one of whom is a guy. The author found out and then went through her phone, discovered flirtatious messages, and confronted the group by sending a message to stop the weekend hangouts if the guy is there. Now, he's keeping her phone and unsure if he should return it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is the act of going through the girlfriend's phone without permission. Privacy is a big factor in relationships. Even if there's trust issues, accessing someone's private messages without consent is generally seen as a violation. The author's action of checking her phone directly breaches that trust, which is a significant problem.\n\nThen, the confrontation. He sent a message to the group chat, which might be considered extreme, especially if he was drunk. The guy's behavior (calling her babe and darling) is clear, but the way the author handled it\u2014publicly shaming in a group chat\u2014could escalate things unnecessarily. It's possible that direct communication with his girlfriend about his feelings would have been a more appropriate approach.\n\nHe's also holding onto her phone, which is a form of retaliation or withholding. This can be seen as controlling and not a healthy way to resolve conflicts. The girlfriend's reaction to the argument might be justified given the privacy invasion.\n\nSo, while the author might feel hurt or jealous, his actions (checking her phone, public confrontation, keeping the phone) are problematic. The right approach would involve discussing his concerns openly rather than invading her privacy. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong.\n"
