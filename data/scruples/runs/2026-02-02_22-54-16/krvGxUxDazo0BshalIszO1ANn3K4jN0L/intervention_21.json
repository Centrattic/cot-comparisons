They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who went through their girlfriend's phone is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend has been hanging out with high school friends, and the author found out that one of them is a guy who's flirting. The author then checked her phone, sent a message to the group chat, and now there's a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is the act of going through someone's phone without permission. That's usually considered a privacy violation, even in a relationship. Trust is important, and checking a partner's phone can erode that trust. Even if there's a reason, like suspicion of flirting, the method of handling it is questionable.\n\nThe author was drunk when they sent the message, which might have made things worse. Acting out of anger or jealousy while intoxicated can lead to decisions that seem impulsive and not well-considered. Also, the author is holding onto the phone, which seems like a power move and not a mature way to resolve the issue.\n\nBut the other side is that the girlfriend was spending a lot of time with her friends, including a guy who was clearly flirting. The author might feel insecure or betrayed. However, the right approach would be to communicate concerns directly with the girlfriend instead of invading her privacy. Confronting her about the behavior and discussing boundaries would be healthier.\n\nSo, even if the author's intentions were to protect the relationship, the method used (checking phone, public confrontation in a group chat) is problematic. Privacy is a fundamental aspect of any relationship, and respecting it is crucial. The author's actions, while perhaps motivated by jealousy, cross a line. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
