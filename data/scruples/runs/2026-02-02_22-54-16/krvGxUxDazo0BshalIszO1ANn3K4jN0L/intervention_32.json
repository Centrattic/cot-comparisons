They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who went through his girlfriend's phone after finding out she's been hanging out with high school friends, one of whom is a guy. He found them flirting in a group chat, got drunk, sent a message to the group, and kept her phone. Now he's wondering if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is privacy. Going through someone's phone without permission is a clear invasion of privacy, regardless of the reason. Even if there was jealousy or suspicion, that doesn't make it right. The guy's actions\u2014reading messages, sending a confrontational message while drunk, and keeping the phone\u2014could all be seen as overreaches.\n\nThen there's the question of trust and communication. Instead of sneaking around, the healthier approach would be to talk to his girlfriend about his concerns. By not doing that and instead taking matters into his own hands, he's potentially damaging trust. Also, being drunk when he acted on his impulses makes it more about a reaction than a thoughtful response.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but from a general perspective, invading privacy is usually seen as a mistake. Even if the guy had valid reasons to be upset, the method he used was inappropriate. So, the answer would likely be that he is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
