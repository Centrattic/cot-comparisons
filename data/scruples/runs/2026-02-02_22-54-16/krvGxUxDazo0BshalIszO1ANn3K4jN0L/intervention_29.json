They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for going through their girlfriend's phone. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author found out their girlfriend has been hanging out with high school friends, including a guy. They went through her phone and found a group chat where the guy was flirting. Then, drunk, the author sent a message to the group chat warning them about the girlfriend's boyfriend and told her not to go out with them again. Now they're holding onto her phone and considering not returning it.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about trust, privacy, and how each party handles the situation. The author didn't trust their girlfriend, possibly without valid reason. Checking her phone without permission is a breach of privacy. Even if they were upset, that action is problematic. Then, the author acted impulsively while drunk, which can exacerbate the situation. Sending a message to the group chat in a confrontational way might have been hurtful and controlling. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable because her privacy was invaded. \n\nThe author might argue that the flirting was a valid concern, but using such extreme measures without discussing it first is not a healthy approach. Trust issues need communication, not surveillance. Holding onto her phone is also a form of retaliation and not a constructive solution. \n\nSo, even though the author might feel justified due to the flirting, their actions crossed boundaries. The right approach would have been to talk to the girlfriend directly, express their feelings, and address the issue together. Instead, they resorted to spying and public confrontation, which is why they're likely in the wrong.\n"
