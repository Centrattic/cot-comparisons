They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see. The situation is about a girlfriend who's been hanging out with her high school friends, and one of them is a guy. The author went through her phone, found flirting messages, then sent a message to the group chat confronting them. Now they're arguing, and he's keeping her phone.\n\nFirst, invading someone's privacy by going through their phone is a big issue. Even if there's a reason, like suspicion of flirting, it's not okay. Trust is important in a relationship, and snooping without permission breaks that. The author might have felt jealous, but the method he used was wrong. \n\nThen, sending a message to the group chat in a drunk state was probably not the best approach. It's confrontational and could escalate things. The girlfriend might not have appreciated being publicly shamed like that. \n\nSo, even if he was hurt or angry, the actions he took\u2014going through her phone and sending that message\u2014were not justified. The right thing would have been to talk to her directly about his concerns instead of acting on them without a conversation. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
