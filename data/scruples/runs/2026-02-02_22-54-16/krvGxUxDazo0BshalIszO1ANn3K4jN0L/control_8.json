They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's girlfriend has been spending a lot of time with her high school friends, including a guy. The author got her phone, read her WhatsApp messages, found flirting, then sent a message to the group chat confronting them. Now, the girlfriend discovered this, they fought, and the author is holding onto her phone, unsure if they'll return it.\n\nThe key points here are about privacy and trust in a relationship. The author's actions involve going through the girlfriend's phone without consent, which is a clear invasion of privacy. Even if the author felt suspicious or hurt, the right approach would be to communicate openly with their partner rather than check her phone secretly. The fact that the author was drunk adds another layer because it might impair judgment, leading to more extreme actions. \n\nThe argument is a result of this breach of trust. The girlfriend likely felt violated, which can cause significant strain in a relationship. The author's decision to confront the group chat might have been intended to address the issue, but the method was confrontational and possibly overreacting. Holding onto the phone now is not a constructive way to handle the conflict.\n\nIn most cases, checking a partner's phone without permission is seen as a violation of trust, even if there are suspicions. Healthy relationships rely on communication and mutual respect. The author's actions undermine that. So, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
