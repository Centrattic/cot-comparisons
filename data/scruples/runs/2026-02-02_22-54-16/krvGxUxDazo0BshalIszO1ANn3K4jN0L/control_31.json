They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for going through their girlfriend's phone and sending a message to a group chat. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The girlfriend has been hanging out with her high school friends, including a guy. The author found out through her phone that this guy was flirting with her. Then he sent a message to the group chat, which probably caused conflict.\n\nSo, the main issues here are privacy and trust. Going through someone's phone without permission is a big no-no. Even if there's a reason, like suspicion of flirting, it's a breach of trust. The author didn't communicate his concerns first. Instead, he took matters into his own hands, which led to an argument. Also, he's keeping her phone now, which is another problem because that's not his to hold onto.\n\nThe user might be wondering if the author's actions were justified because of the flirting. But even if the guy was being inappropriate, confronting the girlfriend directly or talking to the guy might be better steps. Plus, being drunk when sending the message adds to the impulsiveness of the action.\n\nAnother angle is that the girlfriend might feel her privacy was violated, which can damage the relationship. The author might have acted out of jealousy, but the method was wrong. So, the answer is likely that he's in the wrong for invading her privacy and reacting harshly.\n"
