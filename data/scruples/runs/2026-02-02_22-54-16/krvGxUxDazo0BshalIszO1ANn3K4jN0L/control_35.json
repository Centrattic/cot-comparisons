They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong for going through their girlfriend's phone.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The author's girlfriend has been hanging out a lot with high school friends, including a guy. The author took her phone without permission, checked her WhatsApp messages, found what they saw as flirting, then publicly confronted the group. They got into a big argument, and now the author is holding onto the phone.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the unauthorized access to the girlfriend's phone. In most relationships, privacy is a big deal. Even if there's suspicion or jealousy, going through someone's phone is a violation of their privacy. The author's actions, regardless of their motivation (jealousy, trying to protect the relationship), are a breach of trust. \n\nAdditionally, the author acted impulsively, especially mentioning being drunk when sending the message. Publicly confronting the group chat without discussing it privately first could escalate things. The girlfriend catching the author in the act shows a lack of respect for her boundaries.\n\nNow, considering if there's any justification. The author might feel betrayed by the girlfriend's increased time with friends, and maybe the guy's messages were concerning. However, the method used to address it is problematic. The right approach would be to communicate concerns openly, not through spying. \n\nLegally, in many places, accessing someone else's phone without consent is a violation of privacy laws. Ethically, trust and communication are foundational in relationships. The author's actions undermine both.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong. The act of checking the phone without consent is a key factor here. Even if the intent was to address a possible issue, the method was inappropriate.\n"
