They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for going through their girlfriend's phone. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's girlfriend has been hanging out a lot with her high school friends, including a guy. The author discovers through the phone that this guy is flirting with her, so they confront the group by sending a message. The girlfriend caught them with her phone, leading to an argument.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the unauthorized access to the girlfriend's phone. Even if the author had suspicions or felt jealous, going through someone's phone without permission is a violation of privacy. Trust and communication are key in relationships, but this action breaches both. \n\nThe author might argue that the guy was clearly flirting, justifying the intrusion. However, the appropriate response would be to talk to the girlfriend about their concerns rather than invading her privacy. Sending a message to the group chat was confrontational and could have been handled more maturely. \n\nAlso, keeping the phone as leverage after the argument isn't helpful. It's a childish move that escalates the conflict. The root of the problem might be trust issues or insecurity, which should be addressed through open communication, not surveillance.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's actions are problematic. Even though jealousy might be a factor, the method used is wrong. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
