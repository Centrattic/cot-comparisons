They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for checking their girlfriend's phone and then confronting the guy in the group chat.\n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend started hanging out a lot with high school friends, including a guy. The author checked her phone without permission and found flirting messages. Then, drunk, they sent a message to the group chat. Now there's a big argument.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's actions\u2014going through her phone without consent\u2014violate privacy. That's a big issue. Even if they had suspicions, invading someone's privacy without discussing it first can damage trust. The girlfriend might feel betrayed, not just because of the guy, but because her partner didn't respect her privacy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author felt jealous and acted out of concern. But reacting by publicly confronting the group, especially while drunk, adds another layer of problems. It's possible the author's approach was extreme, and the initial act of checking the phone without permission is a breach of trust.\n\nSo, while the author's feelings of jealousy might be understandable, their method of handling it was inappropriate. The correct approach would be to communicate concerns directly with the girlfriend, not to secretly check her phone. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
