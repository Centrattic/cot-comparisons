They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person went through their girlfriend's phone after finding out that one of her high school friends is a guy. They saw flirtatious messages and then sent a message to the group chat, which led to an argument. The author is holding onto the phone and is unsure if they should return it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue seems to be the act of going through the girlfriend's phone without her permission. That's a big red flag in relationships. Privacy is important, and even if there's a reason to be upset, checking someone's phone without consent is generally seen as a violation of trust. It's a boundary that shouldn't be crossed, regardless of the situation.\n\nThen there's the part where the author sent a message to the group chat. While the content of the messages might have been inappropriate, the way the author handled it was confrontational and done out of anger, especially since they were drunk. That could be seen as an overreaction. Instead of addressing the issue calmly, they publicly shamed the girlfriend, which could have damaged the relationship further.\n\nAnother angle is the girlfriend's actions. She was hanging out with this guy and exchanging flirtatious messages, which is definitely problematic. However, the author's response doesn't address the root of the issue\u2014communication. The right approach would have been to talk to the girlfriend about their concerns, express their feelings, and set boundaries together rather than resorting to sneaking through the phone and sending a message to the group chat.\n\nAlso, holding onto the phone is not a healthy way to handle the situation. It's a form of retaliation and could lead to more conflict. The author might be trying to punish the girlfriend, but this kind of behavior can erode trust and respect in the relationship.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, most people would argue that checking someone's phone is a breach of privacy. Even if the author had suspicions, they needed to confront the issue through open dialogue. The fact that they were drunk when they sent the message adds another layer of impulsiveness and lack of judgment.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author made a mistake by invading their girlfriend's privacy. The appropriate action would have been to discuss their concerns openly and respectfully, not to take matters into their own hands in such a public and confrontational manner. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
