They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about checking a girlfriend's phone, finding a guy she's been hanging out with, seeing flirtatious messages, and then confronting them in a group chat while drunk.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is privacy. The author took the girlfriend's phone without permission. Even if they had suspicions, invading someone's privacy is generally considered wrong. Trust is important in relationships, and this action might damage that trust.\n\nThen there's the act of sending a message to the group chat. That's pretty aggressive and public. The author was drunk, which might have influenced their judgment, but it's not an excuse for poor decision-making. Confronting the situation in a group chat could be seen as confrontational and not respectful to the girlfriend, even if the messages were inappropriate.\n\nThe girlfriend likely felt violated when she found out. The author now has her phone and is considering not returning it, which adds to the tension. Even if there was flirting, the method of handling it was extreme. The right approach would have been to talk to the girlfriend privately about the concerns instead of taking matters into their own hands.\n\nSo, while the girlfriend's actions might have been questionable, the author's response was inappropriate. They didn't handle the situation respectfully or confidentially. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
