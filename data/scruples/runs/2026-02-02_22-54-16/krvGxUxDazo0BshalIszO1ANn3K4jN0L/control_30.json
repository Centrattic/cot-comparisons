They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about checking their girlfriend's phone and then sending a message to a group chat when they found out she was flirting with someone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author went through their girlfriend's phone without permission. That's a big red flag right there. Privacy is important in any relationship, and accessing someone's phone without consent is generally considered a breach of trust. Even if there's suspicion or jealousy, the method used here is problematic.\n\nThen, the author found out that a guy was flirting with her, which led them to confront the group chat. The message they sent was a bit extreme, especially since they were drunk. Confronting the group chat in that manner might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. It's possible that a more mature approach, like talking to the girlfriend about the issue first, would have been better.\n\nThe argument that followed and the author keeping the phone afterward shows a lack of resolution. Holding onto the phone instead of returning it could further strain the relationship. The fact that the author is still considering not returning it shows they might not be taking responsibility for their actions.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend was hanging out with her high school friends, including a guy, and there was flirting involved. That's also not great, but the issue here is about the method the author used to handle the situation. Trust should be built on communication rather than spying.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions\u2014checking the phone without consent and publicly confronting the group chat\u2014definitely cross ethical lines. Even if the motivation was jealousy, the means were wrong. The answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
