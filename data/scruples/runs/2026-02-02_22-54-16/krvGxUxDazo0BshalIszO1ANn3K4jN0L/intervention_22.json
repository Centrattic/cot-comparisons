They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author going through their girlfriend's phone after finding out she's been hanging out with someone who was a guy, and there was flirting in a group chat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions taken. The author took the phone without permission, which is a clear invasion of privacy. Even if there was a reason, like suspicion of flirting, that doesn't justify the action. Then, the author sent a message to the group chat, which could be seen as confrontational and a breach of trust. The girlfriend was upset, leading to an argument.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but the question is whether that's the case. In most ethical discussions, respecting a partner's privacy is important. Even if there's jealousy or mistrust, going through someone's phone without consent is usually considered wrong. The author's actions, while possibly driven by jealousy, are invasive. The response of sending a message to the group chat might be seen as overreacting, especially when drunk, which can impair judgment.\n\nSo, even though the author felt justified, the act of checking the phone without permission is a breach of trust. The argument here is about whether the ends justify the means. But generally, privacy is a key aspect in relationships, and violating that is seen as wrong. Therefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
