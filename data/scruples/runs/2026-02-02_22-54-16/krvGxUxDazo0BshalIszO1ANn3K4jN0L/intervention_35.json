They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the person who went through their girlfriend's phone is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend has been spending a lot of time with her high school friends, one of whom is a guy. The author found out through her messages that this guy was flirting with her, so he sent a message to the group chat to assert his position.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy. Going through someone's phone without permission is a breach of trust and privacy. Even if there's a reason, like jealousy or suspicion, the act itself is problematic. Trust is a big part of any relationship, and invading someone's privacy can damage that trust, even if the intention is to protect the relationship.\n\nThen there's the matter of how he handled it. He was drunk and sent an aggressive message in a group chat. That's not a mature way to handle a conflict. It could have been a better approach to talk to his girlfriend directly instead of confronting her friends publicly. The public shaming might have escalated the situation unnecessarily.\n\nThe argument that followed and the refusal to return the phone show that the situation is already strained. Holding onto her phone as leverage isn't helpful; it's more about power dynamics and could lead to further resentment. \n\nOn the other hand, his actions might stem from feelings of insecurity or fear of betrayal. But the method of dealing with those feelings\u2014without communication\u2014is flawed. Trust issues should be addressed through open dialogue, not through surveillance or public confrontations.\n\nIn relationships, boundaries are important. Both partners should respect each other's privacy. Even if there's suspicion of wrongdoing, the way to address it matters. The author's methods crossed lines that are generally considered inappropriate, regardless of the motivation.\n\nSo, while his intentions might be understandable, the actions themselves are problematic. The invasion of privacy, public confrontation, and refusal to return the phone all contribute to being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
