They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author's girlfriend started hanging out with her high school friends every weekend after a reunion. The author found out that one of the friends is a guy and decided to check her WhatsApp messages. He saw flirting happening in a group chat, got drunk, and sent a message to the group saying she can't go out with them again if the guy is there. Now he's keeping her phone and unsure if he should return it.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for going through his girlfriend's phone. Privacy is a big factor. Even in a relationship, people expect some level of privacy. Checking someone's phone without their consent is generally considered a breach of trust. The author might be feeling insecure or jealous, but that doesn't make the action right. \n\nThen, the author sent a message to the group chat while drunk. Being drunk can lead to impulsive decisions, which might explain why he acted out, but it's not an excuse for not respecting her autonomy. The response to the flirting was extreme by confronting the group publicly, which could have escalated the situation. \n\nHe's now holding onto her phone, which is definitely not a good idea. Possessing someone else's phone after a conflict is controlling and can be seen as punishment, which is unhealthy. Relationships require communication and trust, not covert checking and taking actions without discussion. \n\nThe girlfriend caught him, leading to a big argument. The fact that they had an argument and he went home alone shows that his actions hurt her. She might feel disrespected and violated. The author's justification based on jealousy doesn't negate the wrongfulness of invading her privacy. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the act of going through her phone without permission is a breach of trust. The public confrontation was impulsive and extreme. Holding her phone hostage is another issue. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
