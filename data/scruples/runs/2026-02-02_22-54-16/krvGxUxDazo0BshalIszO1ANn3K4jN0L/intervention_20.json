They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for going through his girlfriend's phone and confronting the group chat. The situation is about trust and boundaries in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the main issue is checking her phone without permission. Even if there were reasons, like suspicion of flirting, that doesn't justify invading her privacy. Privacy is important in relationships. Trust is key, and without it, relationships can suffer. \n\nHe found out she was hanging out with someone he didn't know was a guy. Maybe he should have talked to her first instead of snooping. Confronting her via a public group chat when he was drunk might have escalated things. Even if she was flirting, his approach could be seen as disrespectful and controlling. \n\nThe girlfriend might feel her privacy was violated, which is a valid reason for the argument. The author's actions, while possibly coming from a place of hurt, are not justified by the situation. The correct approach would be communication, not spying and public confrontation.\n\nSo, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because he violated her privacy and handled the situation poorly."
