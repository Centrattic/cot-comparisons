They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who went through their girlfriend's phone is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend hanging out with high school friends, including a guy. The author took the phone, read messages where the guy was flirting, and then confronted them in a group chat while drunk.\n\nFirst, the act of going through someone's phone without permission is generally considered a privacy violation. Even if there's a suspicion of infidelity or inappropriate behavior, accessing private messages without consent is a breach of trust. The justification here is that the author found evidence of flirting, but the method of obtaining that evidence is questionable.\n\nThen there's the response: sending a message to the group chat. Being drunk might mitigate the extremity of the action, but it doesn't excuse it. Confronting the group in such a public manner could be seen as overreacting. Also, keeping the phone after the argument is another point against the author. Not returning the phone is a form of retaliation and not a constructive solution.\n\nThe girlfriend's behavior\u2014hanging out with a guy and flirting\u2014could be a separate issue, but that doesn't mean the author's actions are justified. Trust and communication are key in relationships, and privacy is important. The author should have discussed their concerns with the girlfriend instead of invading her privacy.\n\nSo, even though the author had a reason to be upset, the method they used to address the situation is problematic. Therefore, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
