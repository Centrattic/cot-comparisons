They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about going through their girlfriend's phone and confronting others over her flirting.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is privacy. The author took the phone without permission, which is a clear invasion of privacy. Even if they were upset about the girlfriend's interactions, that doesn't justify checking her messages. Trust in a relationship is important, and this action would break that trust.\n\nThen there's the part about sending a message to the group chat. The author was drunk, which might have influenced their decision-making, but that's not an excuse. Publicly confronting someone in a group chat can be seen as aggressive and might escalate the situation. The girlfriend would likely feel disrespected or embarrassed.\n\nThe argument that followed probably stems from the breach of trust and the public confrontation. The author keeping the phone afterward isn't helping the situation either. While the girlfriend might be acting in a way that's concerning, the method of addressing it was wrong.\n\nSo, even though the author had feelings of jealousy, the actions taken were not appropriate. The right approach would have been to talk to the girlfriend directly about the concerns instead of invading her privacy and making a public accusation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
