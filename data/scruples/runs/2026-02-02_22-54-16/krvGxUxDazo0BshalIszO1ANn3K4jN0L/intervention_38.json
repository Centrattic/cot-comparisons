They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for going through their girlfriend's phone. The situation is that the girlfriend has been hanging out with her high school friends, including a guy who was flirting with her. The author took her phone, read the messages, and then sent a message to the group chat. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author went through the girlfriend's phone without permission. That's a privacy issue. Even if there was a reason, like jealousy or suspicion, invading someone's privacy is generally wrong. Then, they sent a message to the group chat, which might have been confrontational. The girlfriend caught them with the phone, leading to an argument.\n\nThe user is on the side of the author, thinking they were justified. But in most cases, respecting a partner's privacy is crucial. Even if there was a perceived betrayal, the right approach would be to communicate openly rather than spying. The drunk factor might have made the reaction more extreme. So, while the author might have felt wronged, the action of checking the phone without consent is typically considered a breach of trust.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the invasion of privacy, regardless of the motivation. The justification doesn't negate the breach of trust involved.\n"
