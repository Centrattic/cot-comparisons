They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for checking their girlfriend's phone. So first, I need to analyze the situation from both sides.\n\nThe author found out their girlfriend was hanging out a lot with old friends, including a guy. They went through her phone without permission, saw flirtatious messages, and then confronted the group. Now they're keeping her phone and there's tension.\n\nKey points: Privacy violation. Checking someone's phone without consent is generally considered a breach of trust and privacy. Even if there were suspicions, the method of addressing it was invasive. The author's actions\u2014reading messages and sending a message in the group chat\u2014could be seen as overreacting, especially while drunk. The girlfriend caught them, leading to an argument.\n\nBut the user might argue that the boyfriend felt insecure because of the girlfriend's behavior. However, the right approach would be to communicate openly rather than invade privacy. The fact that he kept the phone after the argument shows a lack of resolution and more conflict.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If someone suspects their partner of being unfaithful or acting inappropriately, the proper step is to talk about it. Sneaking into their phone undermines that trust and can lead to more issues. The author's justification based on being drunk doesn't excuse the action, though it might explain the impulsiveness.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is likely in the wrong because of the privacy violation and the confrontational approach. Answer A.\n"
