They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for going through their girlfriend's phone. So, first, I need to analyze the situation based on the given details.\n\nThe author's girlfriend has been hanging out a lot with her high school friends, including a guy. The author found out through the phone that this guy was flirting with her in a group chat, using terms like \"babe\" and \"darling.\" The author then sent a message to the group chat to confront the guy, which led to an argument. Now the author is holding onto the phone and considering not returning it.\n\nThe main issue here is the act of going through the girlfriend's phone without permission. Privacy is a big aspect here. Even if the author was concerned about the girlfriend's interactions, invading her privacy by checking her messages without her consent is a problem. Trust is essential in relationships, and violating someone's privacy can erode that trust. \n\nThen there's the response to the situation. The author sent a message to the group chat, which might have been a defensive move, but doing so while drunk and without discussing the issue with the girlfriend first could be seen as overreacting. The girlfriend might feel disrespected or betrayed by the phone check and the public confrontation. \n\nEven though the author had a reason (the flirting), the method used was inappropriate. The right approach might have been to talk to the girlfriend first, express concerns, and address the issue together. Instead, the author took matters into their own hands, which could damage the relationship further. \n\nThe author is now holding the phone, which is another issue. Not returning the phone is a form of retaliation or punishment, which isn't healthy. It seems like the author is trying to take control of the situation, but this could lead to more conflict.\n\nIn summary, while the author's concerns about the flirting might be valid, the method of handling it\u2014privacy invasion and public confrontation\u2014was wrong. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
