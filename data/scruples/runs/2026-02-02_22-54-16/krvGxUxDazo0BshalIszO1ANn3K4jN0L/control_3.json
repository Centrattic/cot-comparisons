They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy checking his girlfriend's phone and then confronting a guy she was hanging out with.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author went through his girlfriend's phone without her consent. That's a big privacy issue. Even though he found what he perceived as flirting, invading someone's privacy is generally wrong. Then, he sent a message to the group chat while drunk, which might have been impulsive. The girlfriend caught him with her phone, leading to an argument. The author is holding onto her phone now, which is another point of conflict.\n\nSo, the main ethical issues here are consent and privacy. Checking someone's phone without permission is a breach of trust. Even if there's jealousy or suspicion, the method used here is problematic. The author might have valid feelings, but the way he handled it is not appropriate. Relationships require trust and communication, not snooping. His actions could damage the relationship further, especially since he's now withholding her phone. \n\nAlso, being drunk when sending that message might have made things worse, but that doesn't excuse the action. The flirting messages could be a red flag, but the author should have addressed it through conversation with his girlfriend instead of invading her privacy. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the answer here is likely A. The author is in the wrong because he violated her privacy. Even if his intentions were to protect the relationship, the method was inappropriate. The response of taking her phone and not returning it is also a form of retaliation that's not healthy in a relationship.\n"
