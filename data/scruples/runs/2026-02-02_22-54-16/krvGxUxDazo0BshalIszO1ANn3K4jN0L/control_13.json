They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about checking the girlfriend's phone, finding out she's flirting with someone else, and then confronting them in a group chat. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author went through the girlfriend's phone without permission. That's a big issue because privacy is important in relationships. Even if there's suspicion of something, invading someone's privacy without consent is generally seen as a violation. \n\nThen, when they found out there was a guy in the group chat with flirtatious messages, the author responded by sending a message to the group chat, which is pretty public. They also said the girlfriend wouldn't go out with them again if the guy was there. The author mentions being drunk, which might have influenced their actions, but that doesn't necessarily excuse the behavior.\n\nNow, the consequences: the girlfriend caught them, there was a big argument, and the author is holding onto the phone. The author might think they were justified because of the flirting, but the method of handling it was confrontational and possibly over the top.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. Instead of secretly checking the phone, the better approach would have been to talk to the girlfriend about the concerns directly. The act of going through the phone without permission breaches trust, even if the intent was to address a real issue. \n\nAlso, responding in a public group chat by threatening to cut off interactions could escalate tensions and be seen as aggressive. The girlfriend might feel that the author didn't respect her boundaries by checking the phone and then publicly shaming the group. \n\nSo putting it all together: the initial action of checking the phone without consent is a clear violation of privacy. The subsequent actions were reactive and possibly harsh. While there might have been valid concerns about the flirting, the method used was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because their actions crossed boundaries and didn't respect the girlfriend's privacy, even if their intentions were to address infidelity concerns."
