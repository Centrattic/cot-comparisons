They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about going through the girlfriend's phone after finding out one of her friends is a guy and there's flirting happening.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author took the phone without permission, checked WhatsApp messages, found a group chat with obvious flirting, and then sent a message to the group. They were drunk and maybe acted out of line. The girlfriend found them with her phone, leading to an argument. The author now has her phone and is considering not returning it.\n\nSo, the main issues here are privacy invasion and how they handled the situation. Even if there was valid concern about the flirting, going through someone's phone without consent is a major breach of trust. The author's actions, while perhaps driven by jealousy, are not justified. The response of sending a message to the group chat in a confrontational way is also problematic. The fact that they were drunk might explain some of the impulsiveness but doesn't excuse the behavior. Keeping the phone as leverage is also not a good resolution. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. Instead of checking the phone, the author should have addressed their concerns with the girlfriend directly. The act of invading privacy and then escalating the situation by public confrontation is likely to be seen as the author's fault. The girlfriend has the right to privacy, and the author overstepped their bounds. So, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
