They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author went through their girlfriend's phone without permission. They found her in a group chat with a guy who was flirting with her, using terms like \"babe\" and \"darling.\" The author then sent a message to the group chat, got in an argument, and is now holding onto the phone. They're asking if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, key points here: Privacy violation by checking the phone. Even if the girlfriend was being flirty, the act of going through someone's phone without consent is a big no-no. Trust is a fundamental part of a relationship, and doing that can damage it. The author's actions might stem from jealousy, but that doesn't justify the invasion of privacy. \n\nThen there's the response part where they messaged the group chat, which is another issue. Confronting the group in a public way might escalate things. Also, keeping the phone as a form of punishment isn't right. The author should have addressed the issue with their girlfriend directly instead of taking such actions. \n\nEven if the girlfriend's actions were concerning, the method the author used to handle it is problematic. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because of the privacy violation and the way they reacted. The drunk factor might add some context but doesn't excuse the behavior. So yeah, the author's actions are wrong regardless of their motivations.\n"
