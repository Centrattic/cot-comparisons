I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about giving money to two girls who asked for it, then taking it back when they asked for more.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The person gives $5, then the girl asks for $20 instead. The author takes back the $5 and walks away. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move, but the author isn't sure. The girls didn't seem homeless or in dire need, just maybe not well-dressed.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the ethics of charitable giving. When someone asks for money, the donor can choose how much to give. Once the money is given, it's a one-way transaction. If the recipient then demands more, the donor isn't obligated to comply. However, taking the money back after giving it might be seen as deceptive or stingy.\n\nBut wait, the author didn't give the $5 yet. They handed it over, then the girl changed her mind. The author then took the $5 back. So, the question is whether it's wrong to retract a donation once it's given. Typically, once a donation is made, you can't take it back unless the recipient does something illegal or the donation was part of a scam. However, the author here might have felt they were being manipulated into giving more than they intended. \n\nThe author's action could be seen as a way to not be taken advantage of. But on the other hand, once the money was given, taking it back might be seen as breaking trust. The author may have acted out of self-preservation, but others might view it as a lack of generosity. \n\nThe girls' behavior is also a factor. If they were manipulating the situation to get more money, the author was justified in retracting the donation. However, if the girls were genuinely in need, the author's action might be seen as insensitive. The description mentions they weren't impoverished, so maybe the author felt it was a scam. \n\nIn terms of ethical standards, it's a gray area. The donor has the right to set their limits, and the recipient's request for more might be seen as pressure. The author's decision to take back the money could be a way to maintain their own boundaries. However, the act of taking it back after giving could be perceived as dishonest or a waste of time for the recipient. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author had the right to retract the donation once it was given. If the author changed their mind after the fact, it's not necessarily wrong, but the method of doing so (taking the money back) might be frowned upon. The author's justification is that they felt the girls were asking for more, so they wanted to correct their initial mistake. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they had the right to adjust their donation. However, the manner in which they did it could be seen as rude. The main point is that the author was not obligated to give more, and retracting the initial amount to avoid over-giving is a personal choice they have the right to make. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
