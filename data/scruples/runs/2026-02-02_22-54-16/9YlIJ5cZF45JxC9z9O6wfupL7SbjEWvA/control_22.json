I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user asked if the person who wrote the Ask the Experts (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves giving a small amount of money to two girls who asked for spare change and then retracting it when they ask for more. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The author gave $5 to the older girl, but the younger one asked for $20. Then the author took back the $5, saying they'll give a $20 instead. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move. The author's justification is that the girls didn't look impoverished or homeless, just untidy without shoes but still clean.\n\nSo, the question is about whether the author was wrong to take back the $5. Let's break it down. When someone asks for money, the giver has the right to decide how much to give. Once given, though, the author tried to take it back. That's a bit tricky. Giving to a child is different from giving to an adult. Usually, you might give to a parent or guardian, not directly to a child, because they can't handle such situations. But the author gave it to the older girl, maybe assuming she was in charge. \n\nThen, when the older girl says they want $20, the author retracts the $5. The problem here is that the author initially gave the $5, which the girls might have accepted. Then taking it back could be seen as deceptive or not trustworthy. Even if the author didn't want to give more, once the money is given, it's theirs to keep. The author might have felt pressured when the amount was increased, so they withdrew the original offer. \n\nThe girls' appearance isn't a solid reason to take the money back. The author's assumption about their situation (not impoverished) is their own judgment and might not be accurate. The key issue is the act of taking back the money after it was given. That's the main point of contention. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often give money to beggars, but if the person doesn't accept it, you can't force them to take it. However, if you give it, it's usually expected to be a donation. Retracting it could be seen as rude or manipulative. The author's action might have been abrupt, and the girls might have felt embarrassed or tricked. Also, giving to a child can be problematic because they might not be in a position to handle such transactions. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they gave the money and then took it back, which is a reversal that can be considered inconsiderate. The justification about the girls' appearance is subjective, and the action of taking back the money after giving it is the main issue. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
