I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the story is about someone giving money to a child, then taking it back when the child asks for more. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for doing that.\n\nFirst, the author gave $5 to a 12-year-old girl and her sister. The girl then says they want $20. The author takes back the $5 and walks away. The girlfriend says it was a dick move. The author isn't sure because the kids looked clean and not homeless.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The initial act of giving $5 is generous. But when the girl asks for $20, maybe the author thought he was being taken advantage of? But wait, the girl might not have realized the $5 was a small amount. Maybe she thought he was offering a token and wanted more help. But the author took back the $5 instead of just refusing again.\n\nIs it wrong to take back the money? If the author realized he had made a mistake in giving $5, maybe he should have explained that he couldn't give more, rather than taking back the $5. Taking it back might have been confusing or hurtful to the kids. The author's action could be seen as stingy or not being truthful. Instead of taking it back, he could have said he can't give more money. But by taking it, he might have made the kids feel like he was mocking them or being insincere. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author felt he was being asked for more than he wanted to give. But the initial $5 was given, then the request for $20 was unexpected. The author might have thought the girl was trying to get more money, so taking back the $5 was a way to not be taken advantage of. However, taking back the money after giving it could be seen as dishonest or mean-spirited. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests she thought it was rude. The author's reasoning that the kids weren't homeless might imply he thought they were asking for money inappropriately. But even if they weren't in dire need, the act of taking back the money could still be considered inconsiderate. \n\nIn terms of social norms, giving money to someone in need is a kind act. If the situation wasn't genuine, maybe the author was right to second-guess. However, the way he took back the money might have been unkind. He should have either given more if he could, or politely declined without retracting his initial gift. \n\nI think the key here is the act of taking back the money after giving it. That's where the author's action might be seen as wrong. It's better to give and not take it back, or to not give in the first place if unsure. Retracting the gift could be seen as a poor decision. So the author might be in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
