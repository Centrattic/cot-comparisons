I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about giving money to two girls, first $5, then taking it back when the older girl asks for $20. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move, but the author isn't sure.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author gave $5 to a 12-year-old and her 6-year-old sister. The older girl then says they want $20. The author takes back the $5 and leaves. The girls aren't in obvious distress, just maybe untidy but not homeless.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, giving money out of kindness is a good gesture, but when the child asks for more, the author's reaction could be seen as insincere. The problem is that the author took back the money after already giving it. People might see this as mockery or a lack of genuine generosity. On the other hand, the author might have felt taken advantage of, but the initial act was a donation. The girls didn't force the money; they just asked. The author could have just said they can't give more without being rude. However, taking back the money after giving it might be perceived as a mean trick, especially with children who might not understand. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that this is considered inconsiderate. So, the author might be in the wrong because they took back the money, which could hurt the girls or make them feel embarrassed. But others might argue it's their money to give or take back. Hmm. The answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong because the action appears to mock the girls' request, even if they didn't need the money. It's a social faux pas because once you give, taking it back can be seen as a joke or trick, which isn't nice.\n"
