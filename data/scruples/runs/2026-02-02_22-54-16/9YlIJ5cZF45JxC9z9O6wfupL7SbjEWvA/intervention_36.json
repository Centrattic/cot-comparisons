I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they gave a $5 bill to a girl asking for money, then realized the girl wanted $20, took the $5 back, and walked away. The girlfriend says it was a dick move, but the author isn't sure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. When someone asks for money, especially a child, there's an expectation that the donation is given in good faith. The author initially gave $5, which the girl then rejected, asking for $20 instead. By taking the $5 back, the author effectively withdrew the donation. But the question is whether that action is wrong. \n\nOn one hand, giving money to a child might not be the best idea regardless of the amount. Some might argue that helping is important, so taking back the $5 and not giving $20 could be seen as stingy or not being a good Samaritan. The girl might have been in a situation where she needed more money, so the author's refusal after the initial offer could be viewed as not following through on their generosity.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have felt misled or taken advantage of. If the girl asked for $5 and then immediately escalated to $20, the author could feel that their initial offer was insufficient and might not want to give more. The author isn't obligated to give more money than they're comfortable with, even if it's a child. Also, the girls' appearance (not impoverished or homeless) might lead the author to doubt their need for $20, making the request seem less legitimate.\n\nBut wait, when the author gave the $5, the girl said they wanted $20. That implies she might not have been satisfied with the initial amount. However, the author's action of taking back the $5 could be seen as a refusal, not necessarily a trick. But there's a nuance here: once you give money, even if the person asks for more, taking it back might be perceived as a betrayal of trust, especially if the child was relying on that $5. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the author should have given the $5 and then said they couldn't give more. Instead, taking it back could be seen as mocking or not being sincere. Children might not have the same expectations as adults, but if the author took the $5 back, the girl might feel that the author was playing with her or not serious. \n\nAlso, the context matters. If the girls were in a place where panhandling is common or if there are specific local circumstances, that could influence the judgment. But the author mentions they weren't clearly impoverished, so maybe the situation isn't as dire as it could be. \n\nSo, the author could be justified in not giving $20, but the act of taking back the $5 might be the issue. Once a donation is made, retracting it can be seen as insincere or dishonest. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that this approach might not be respectful, especially towards a child. \n\nTherefore, while the author isn't necessarily wrong for not giving $20, the way they took back the $5 could be considered inconsiderate or a dick move. The key is in the action of taking back the money after giving it, which might not be the best approach even if the author isn't in the wrong overall.\n"
