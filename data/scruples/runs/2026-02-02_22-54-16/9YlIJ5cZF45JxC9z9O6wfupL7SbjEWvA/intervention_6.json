I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the Reddit post) is in the wrong for taking back the $5 after a girl initially asked for $5 but then changed her mind and wanted $20 instead.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author gives $5 to a girl who then says they actually wanted $20. The author takes back the $5 and walks away. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move, but the author is unsure. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, when someone gives money with the intention of it being a donation, and then the recipient changes their mind about the amount they want, does the giver have the right to take it back? Legally, once the money is given, it belongs to the recipient unless there was an agreement beforehand. But morally, it's different. The author gave the $5 in good faith, thinking that was the amount the girl wanted. When the girl upped the amount, maybe she was trying to get more than she initially asked for. The author then took back the $5 because he was willing to give $20 instead. \n\nBut wait, the author didn't actually give the $20. He said he would take back the $5 and give a $20 bill. But he didn't actually give it. So he walked away after taking back the $5. The key here is whether the author was trying to trick the girl or if he was just realizing he had given less than intended. \n\nAnother angle: The girl might have asked for $5 first and then changed her mind. The author gave the $5, but then the girl requested more. The author took back the $5 and said he would give $20. Since he didn't actually give the $20, he didn't fulfill the request. So maybe the author thought he had made a mistake in giving the initial $5 and tried to correct it by taking it back. \n\nBut the problem is, once the money is given, the recipient owns it. So taking it back without their consent might be considered unethical. However, if the author thought he had misunderstood the amount the girl wanted, maybe he had the right to take it back as a correction. But that's only if there was an agreement or a mutual understanding that the money could be taken back if there was a mistake. In this case, there wasn't any such agreement. \n\nThe author might have felt that giving $5 was insufficient, and when the girl asked for $20, he realized he wanted to give more. But by taking back the $5, he's effectively trying to change the terms after the fact. That could be seen as dishonest because the girl might have expected the $5 to stay. \n\nOn the other hand, if the girl changed her mind, maybe the author was within his rights to take back the money to give the correct amount. But again, once the money is given, it's not his to take back unless there's some form of agreement or if the transaction is voided. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, people often expect that when you give money, it's a completed action. Taking it back after the fact could be seen as a bit of a trick, even if the intention was good. The girl might have felt manipulated, thinking that the author was trying to get out of giving $20 by taking back the $5. \n\nThe author's girlfriend thinks it's a dick move, which suggests that some people might view it as insincere or trying to avoid giving more. However, others might argue that the author was trying to correct his mistake and be generous by offering $20. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's action of taking back the $5 was a mistake correction or an attempt to avoid giving more. If it was a mistake, then maybe it's okay. But if it was an attempt to deceive, then it's not. Since the situation is described as the girl asking for $5 first, then $20, the author might have thought he gave less than intended. Taking back the $5 to give the correct amount could be seen as trying to do the right thing, but without the recipient's consent, it's problematic. \n\nIn the end, the author might be in the wrong because once the money is given, retracting it without the recipient's agreement is generally considered unethical. However, if the author had a clear reason to believe there was a misunderstanding, maybe it's a grey area. But given the information, the more likely answer is that the author is in the wrong (A) because taking back the money after giving it can be seen as deceptive.\n"
