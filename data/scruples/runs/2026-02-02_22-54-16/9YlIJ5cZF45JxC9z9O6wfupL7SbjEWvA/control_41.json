I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about giving money to two girls who asked for it.\n\nSo the author was buying pizza, got approached by two girls. Initially gave them $5, but then the older girl asked for $20 instead. The author then took back the $5 and walked away. His girlfriend thinks it was a dick move, but he's unsure. They mention the girls looked untidy but not homeless or impoverished.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author gave money out of kindness but then was asked for more. He took back the $5 because he wasn't willing to give $20. The main question is whether this action was wrong.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he might feel he was being taken advantage of. He gave $5, then the girl asked for $20, which he didn't want to give. He took back the $5 to avoid overcommitting. But his girlfriend thinks it was rude. \n\nOn the other hand, the girls might have been in need, but the author isn't sure they were. The author didn't confirm their need, just gave money. Then when they asked for more, he tried to retract. The problem is that once you give money, can you take it back? Legally, maybe not, but socially?\n\nSocially, if you give a gift or donation, it's usually expected that the recipient keeps it. Taking it back could be seen as dishonest or disrespectful. The author might have been trying to correct a mistake, but the act of taking back the money could be viewed as a betrayal of trust. Even if the girls were not in real need, the author's initial act was charitable, and then he rescinded it, which could be seen as insincere or stingy.\n\nBut also, the author wasn't obligated to give money in the first place. He chose to give, then changed his mind. However, once given, the money is theirs. Taking it back could be seen as a breach of trust. The girls might have felt tricked or disrespected. Even if they were not in need, the author's action could be seen as a poor decision rather than a moral wrong. But some might argue that he had the right to change his mind, especially if he realized the girls weren't in genuine need.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they weren't obviously homeless or impoverished, so he might have felt it was a scam. But if they were just in need of some money, taking it back could be seen as cruel. The key here is the perception of the situation. If the girls were actually in need, the author's action would be worse. But since he's unsure, maybe he acted on a suspicion rather than fact.\n\nIn terms of social norms, if someone gives a donation and then takes it back, it's generally frowned upon. People might see it as a manipulation tactic. The author's action could be considered wrong because he didn't follow through on his initial generosity. Even if he changed his mind, taking back the money might have been hurtful to the girls, regardless of their actual need.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because retracting a donation after giving can be seen as dishonest and disrespectful, regardless of the initial intent.\n"
