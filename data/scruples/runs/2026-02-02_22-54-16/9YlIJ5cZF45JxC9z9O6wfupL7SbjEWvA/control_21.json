I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking back the $5 after the girl initially asked for $5 and then changed to $20. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author gives $5 to a girl, who then says they actually want $20. The author asks for the $5 back to give $20 instead. The author then takes the $5 and leaves. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move, but the author is unsure.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author gave $5 initially, which the girl accepted. Then she changed her mind, asking for $20. The author wants to fulfill the request but wants to give the full $20. So he takes back the $5 to replace it with $20. \n\nIs this a problem? Well, if someone gives you money and then changes the amount, do you have the right to ask for it back? If the $5 was a gift or a donation, then the recipient can't demand it back. But in this case, the author was giving it as a donation, not a transaction. So once the $5 was given, the author can't just take it back. Even if the girl changed her mind about the amount, the author can't un-give the $5. \n\nBut maybe the author's intention was to give $20. So when the girl asked for $5 first, he gave it, but then realized she wanted more. But once the $5 is given, it's a done deal. The author can't take it back. So maybe he acted inconsiderate by taking back the money after it was already given. The girls might have felt disrespected or manipulated. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests that this was inconsiderate. The author might have thought he was being generous by giving $20, but taking back the $5 could be seen as a trick. Also, the author mentions the girls looked untidy but not homeless. Maybe he was being cautious, thinking they weren't in real need. But regardless, once you give money, you can't take it back. \n\nSo the answer is probably A (author is in the wrong) because taking back the money after giving it was a mistake. The author should have just given $20 without taking back the $5. Alternatively, he could have said, \"Sorry, I can't give $20, but here's $5.\" But taking back the $5 after already giving it was a bad move. That's why the girlfriend is upset. The author's action could be seen as stingy or dishonest, even if his intention was to give more.\n"
