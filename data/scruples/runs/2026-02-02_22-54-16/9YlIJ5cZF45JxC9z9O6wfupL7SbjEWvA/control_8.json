I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author gave a 12-year-old girl $5, but then the girl asked for $20 instead. The author took back the $5 and walked away. His girlfriend thinks it was a dick move. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the author gave the girl $5, which was an act of charity, right? But then the girl, maybe with her younger sister, initially asked for money and then upped the amount. That's a bit odd. Why would they ask for $20 after getting $5? Maybe the older sister wanted more because the younger one is with her? Or perhaps they were testing the person?\n\nThe author then says, \"Oh sorry, take back the $5 and I'll get $20.\" But wait, the author took back the $5 and walked away. So instead of actually giving $20, they just took back the $5. That's the crux here. The author was generous with $5 but when asked for more, decided to revoke the initial donation instead of fulfilling the request. \n\nNow, is that fair? Well, when you give money to someone in need, especially a child, maybe you expect a certain level of honesty. If the girl had asked for $20 from the start, maybe the author would have given it. But by increasing the amount after receiving some, maybe there's an element of manipulation. However, the author's action of taking back the $5 could be seen as being stingy or not charitable. On the other hand, maybe the author felt misled after giving the initial amount and decided not to give more.\n\nAnother angle: the author's girlfriend says it was a dick move. That's a common reaction. People might feel that once you give money, even if the request changes, you shouldn't take it back. The girls weren't in obvious distress, so maybe the author doubted their need after seeing they weren't homeless. But the author still gave $5 initially, which was good. Then the girl's request for $20 might have triggered suspicion. \n\nBut the problem is, when you give money, you can't take it back unless there's fraud. The girl didn't lie initially; she just asked for more later. The author might have felt that the request was insincere, but how can they know? Maybe the girl was just trying to get more money. However, taking back the $5 could be seen as being rude or not following through on a charitable act. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the girl was being honest, the author could have just given $20. But since she changed her mind, maybe the author thought she was being deceitful. But taking back the initial $5 after giving it might be seen as a bad move. It's like backing out of a donation once you've already given it. People might expect that once you give, you don't take it back unless there's a reason. So maybe the author was wrong to take back the money. \n\nBut then again, if the girls weren't in real need, perhaps the author was right to be cautious. The description says they weren't homeless or impoverished, just untidy. Maybe the author felt they were being taken advantage of. However, the initial act was generous, and then retracting it might come off as being mean-spirited. \n\nI think the key point is that the author gave the money in good faith, and upon realizing the girls weren't in dire need, felt it was a scam. But the problem is, by taking back the $5, the author's action might be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the girls were trying to get more money, the author could have just refused to give $20 but didn't need to take back the $5. \n\nSo, if the author took back the $5, that's problematic because once you give money, you can't take it back unless there's a misunderstanding or fraud. If the girl said \"we want $20,\" the author could have said they can't give that and kept the $5. Taking it back after giving it is a bit like rescinding a gift, which might be rude. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, if the author felt the initial request was genuine but the follow-up was insincere, they might have a point. But the act of taking back the money could be seen as stingy or not charitable. So, the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they gave the money and then took it back, which isn't a good move. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe B because they were cautious and realized it wasn't a real need. Hmm.\n"
