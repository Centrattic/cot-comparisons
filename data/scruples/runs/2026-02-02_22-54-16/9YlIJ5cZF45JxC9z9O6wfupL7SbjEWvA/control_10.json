I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking back the $5 they gave to two girls. The situation is a bit tricky because it involves charity and expectations.\n\nFirst, the author gave $5 to the older girl, but then the younger one said they wanted $20. The author then took back the $5 and walked away. The girlfriend thinks it was a dick move. The key points here are the intent of the author and the actions taken.\n\nWhen someone asks for money, especially a child, there's an expectation that the donor is giving out of goodwill. By taking back the $5 after the younger girl's request, the author might have come across as insincere or stingy. Even if the author felt the girls weren't in dire need, the act of giving and then retracting could be seen as disrespectful or mocking.\n\nAlso, the girls' appearance isn't a clear indicator of their need. The author's judgment about their situation might not be accurate. The problem here is more about the perception and the action of taking back the money. People who solicit donations expect the giver to follow through on their initial offer. Retracting it after the fact, even if for a reason, can be seen as a breach of trust or a mean gesture.\n\nSo, considering the social norms around charity and the impact of the author's actions on the recipients, the author might be in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
