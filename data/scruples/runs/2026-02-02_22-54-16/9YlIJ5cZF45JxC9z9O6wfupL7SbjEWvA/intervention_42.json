I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author did the wrong thing by taking back the money when the kids asked for more. So the situation is: the author gives $5 to two girls, maybe around 12 and 6, who asked for money. Then the older girl says they want $20 instead. The author takes back the $5 and walks away. The girlfriend says it's a dick move, but the author isn't sure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author gave $5 voluntarily. Then, after giving it, the girl changed their mind and asked for more. So the author took back the $5. The girls didn't seem homeless or in dire need, just maybe asking for money. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, once the money is given, it belongs to the recipient. But in this case, the author took it back after the initial transaction. Wait, but did the author actually give the money? The scenario says the author gave $5, then the girl asked for $20. The author then took the $5 back. So it's possible that the $5 wasn't a completed transaction. Maybe the author gave the $5 but then took it back before any exchange for a service or item. \n\nSo in terms of ethics, was the author justified in doing that? Some might say that once you give money, it's theirs. Others might say that if there's a misunderstanding or a change in the request, it's okay to correct it. The author might feel they were tricked, but if they gave the money voluntarily, maybe they shouldn't take it back. However, if the girls upped the amount right after receiving the $5, maybe they were expecting to get $20 and the $5 was a mistake. \n\nThe author's action could be seen as taking advantage of the situation. The girls might have been testing people, hoping to get more money. The author could argue they made a mistake in giving the initial $5 and corrected it when they realized the higher amount was needed. But others might say that once you give money, you can't take it back, especially if the recipient is a child. \n\nAlso, the author mentions the girls looked untidy but not homeless. So maybe they were just asking for pocket money. The author might not have had ill intent, but taking back the money after giving it could be seen as a breach of trust. On the other hand, the author might not have wanted to give $20 and decided to retract the $5 when they realized the request was for more. \n\nIn terms of social norms, some people might think it's okay to adjust your contribution if there's a misunderstanding. Others might think it's rude to take back money once given, regardless of the reason. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that she thinks it's a bad move, implying that taking back the money was inconsiderate. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's action is debatable. Legally, they might not be in the wrong if the money wasn't a completed transaction. Ethically, it's more about intent and perception. If the author felt misled, they might justify it, but others might see it as not trustworthy. I think the answer depends on whether the author intended to give the $5 as a donation, which once given, should remain with the recipient. So taking it back could be considered wrong, hence answer A. But maybe the author had the right to retract if the girls changed their request. Hmm. I'm a bit torn here. Maybe the key is that once you give money, even if the recipient asks for more, you shouldn't take it back. So the author is in the wrong. Therefore, answer A.\n"
