I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking back the $5 after the girls asked for $20. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation clearly. The author gave the girls $5, and then the older girl asked for $20 instead. The author then took back the $5 and left. The key points here are the initial act of giving $5, the subsequent request for more money, and the author's response.\n\nIn many places, if someone offers money to a child, the transaction is usually considered a gift. Once the money is given, the recipient can't typically demand it back unless there's an agreement. However, the author didn't give the $5 as a gift yet; they were about to give a $20 bill in exchange. So maybe the author thought they were making a transaction where the girls were asking for more money, and the author changed their mind.\n\nBut the problem is that if the money was already handed over, the author can't just take it back unless there's a mutual agreement. The author took back the $5 without the girls' consent, which might be seen as theft. Additionally, the girls might have expected the $5 as a charitable donation, and the author's action could be seen as manipulating the situation to avoid giving more.\n\nHowever, the context also mentions the girls' appearance\u2014untidy but not homeless. This might suggest they were panhandling, which can be a gray area. But the author's action of taking back the money after giving it could be perceived as dishonest, especially if the initial $5 was a genuine donation.\n\nSo, the author's action of taking back the $5 without consent might be considered wrong, as it could be seen as breaking trust. Even if the author felt misled later, taking back the money without agreement could be unethical or even a legal issue. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
