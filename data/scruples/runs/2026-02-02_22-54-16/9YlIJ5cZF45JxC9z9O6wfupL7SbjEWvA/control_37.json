I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about giving $5 to two girls who asked for money, then taking it back when they asked for $20 instead.\n\nFirst, the author initially gives $5, which is a kind gesture. The girls then ask for $20, which might have been unexpected. The author takes back the $5 and offers $20 instead. The girlfriend thinks this was a dick move, but the author isn't sure. The girls didn't seem homeless or in dire need, just maybe in a rough situation.\n\nSo, was the author wrong? Well, when someone asks for money, it's implied that they want a certain amount. If the author thought they could help with $5, then they might have given it with the understanding of that amount. Changing the offer after giving the $5 could seem insincere. However, the girls might have had a specific request in mind. Taking back the money might make it seem like the author was trying to help but then changed their mind, which could be confusing or hurtful.\n\nBut also, the author isn't obligated to give money if they don't want to. However, once they gave the $5, taking it back might come off as a bit of a trick. The key here is intent. If the author was genuinely trying to help but realized they could give more, they should have said that. Taking back the $5 might not be the best approach. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because they gave money with the expectation it would be accepted, then took it back, which could be seen as disrespectful or deceptive.\n"
