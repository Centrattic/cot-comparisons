I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about giving money to two girls, first $5 then taking it back when they asked for $20. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author was buying pizza and gave $5 to a 12-year-old and her 6-year-old sister who asked for money. The girls then said they wanted $20. The author took back the $5, saying they'd get a $20, but then walked away. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move, but the user thinks the author isn't wrong. \n\nSo, the key points here: Was the author obligated to give $20 after giving $5? Did the girls make a mistake or a change of heart? From the author's perspective, they might have thought it was a mistake\u2014like maybe the older girl said $20 by accident, so taking back the $5 seems logical. But the girls might have genuinely wanted $20, thinking the $5 was too little. \n\nEthically, when someone gives money to a minor, especially with good intentions, but then the recipient changes their request, is the giver responsible to fulfill a higher amount? Legally, the author isn't obligated because a gift is a gift unless there's a contract. But morally, maybe there's a different angle. \n\nThe author might have felt the girls weren't in desperate need, as they mentioned they were \"not impoverished or homeless.\" So maybe the author thought the initial $5 was enough and didn't want to give more. However, the act of taking back the money after giving it could be seen as unkind or manipulative. Did the author have the right to take it back once given? \n\nAnother angle: The girls might be trying to scam people by upping their request, which the author noticed. But the author didn't confirm the girls' intent; they just took back the money. If the girls genuinely needed $20, taking back the $5 could leave them with nothing. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is that they gave $5, then realized they wanted $20, so they took back the $5 to give more, but then didn't follow through. That's confusing. Why take back the $5 if they intended to give $20 later? Maybe the author changed their mind after giving the $5, thinking they could give more, but then decided not to. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were honest. If the author genuinely intended to give $20, they should have done so. If they were just testing the girls or had no intention of giving $20, then taking back the $5 could be seen as deceitful. \n\nAlso, the author's description of the girls as \"untidy but not impoverished\" suggests they might not be in real need. So perhaps the author felt the request was insincere. But taking back the money after giving it could still be seen as a breach of trust, even if the initial act was generous. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions might be morally questionable because they gave money with the expectation it would stay with the girls. Taking it back could be seen as stingy or dishonest, especially if the girls were genuinely in need. However, if the author thought the girls were trying to scam, then taking back the money was a way to prevent being taken advantage of. But since the author didn't confirm the girls' intent, it's hard to say. The answer might depend on the author's intent and how the situation was perceived.\n"
