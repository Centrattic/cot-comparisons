I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they gave a 12-year-old and her 6-year-old sister $5, but the older sister then asked for $20 instead. The author took back the $5 and walked away. The girlfriend says it was a dick move, but the user thinks the author is not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girls approached the author to ask for spare change. He gave them $5, but then the older sister upped the request to $20. The author then takes back the $5 and says he'll get a $20 instead. The key points here are intent and whether there's any deception involved.\n\nThe author didn't have any prior agreement to give $20. The initial offer was $5, and the girl's request for $20 after receiving the $5 seems like a change in the request. The author is then within his rights to withdraw his initial offer. People can change their minds when asked for more. The author isn't obligated to fulfill a higher amount unless there was a binding agreement.\n\nAlso, the girls weren't homeless or in immediate need, according to the description. They were just untidy but clean. So, the author's action might be seen as a reasonable response to an unexpected increase in the request. There's no indication that the girls were in distress or that the author was being scammed. The author's decision to retract the $5 and offer $20 instead shows willingness to comply with the new request, but only if the original amount was returned.\n\nHowever, some might argue that once the money was given, it was a donation, and taking it back could be seen as stingy or dishonest. But in reality, the author was responding to a new request. The initial $5 was a voluntary donation, but when the girl asked for $20 instead, the author is free to adjust his contribution.\n\nAnother angle: the author might have felt misled if the girl had intended to ask for $20 all along. But since they first asked for spare change, which is typically a smaller amount, the author's reaction is understandable. There's no evidence of deceit from the girls' side.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's action of taking back the $5 to give $20 is a reasonable reaction. He's not in the wrong because he wasn't bound to give the $20 initially, and he's responding appropriately to a changed request. The answer should be B (No).\n"
