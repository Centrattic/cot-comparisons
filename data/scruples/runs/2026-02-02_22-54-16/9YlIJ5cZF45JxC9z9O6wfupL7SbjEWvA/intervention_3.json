I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author gave a girl $5, but then the girl asked for $20 instead. The author took back the $5 and left. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move, but the author doesn't. The question is whether the author is wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author initially gave $5, which the girl then said they wanted $20. The author took back the $5 and walked away. The key points here are the intent behind the initial donation and whether the author's action of retracting the $5 is justified.\n\nWhen someone asks for money, the donor can choose to give any amount. The author gave $5, which was their choice. Then the girl asked for more. The author might have felt that since they already gave $5, they didn't want to give more. But the girl might have felt that the initial amount was insufficient, so she asked for $20. The author then took back the $5. \n\nNow, is this wrong? Well, once the $5 was given, it's no longer the author's money. Taking it back after giving it could be seen as unethical because once you give money, it's supposed to be a donation. However, some might argue that the author had the right to take back the money if they realized they didn't want to give it. But in this case, the author gave the $5, then upon learning the higher amount needed, decided to take back the $5. \n\nBut wait, the author's action of taking back the $5 might be seen as stingy or not trustworthy. If someone gives money and then takes it back when the recipient asks for more, that could be seen as being inconsiderate. Alternatively, maybe the girl was just trying to get more by acting surprised at the initial amount. \n\nThe author's note says the girls looked untidy but not impoverished. That might affect the perception. If they weren't in dire need, the author might feel less obligated. However, once the money was given, taking it back might still be seen as a poor move. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have changed their mind. Sometimes people give money impulsively and later regret it. But once it's given, it's their choice. So taking it back could be wrong because it's taking away what was already given. \n\nSo the ethical dilemma here is the retraction of the donation. The initial act of giving is fine, but taking it back might not be. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong (A) because they took back the money after giving it. But there's also the argument that they had the right to retract their donation if they changed their mind. \n\nHowever, in most cases, once a gift is given, especially to someone in need, retracting it is seen as unethical. So the answer would be A. But I need to check if there's any nuance. Maybe the author didn't have the money to give $20, so they wanted their $5 back. But the act of taking it back after giving it is still questionable. \n\nSo I think the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
