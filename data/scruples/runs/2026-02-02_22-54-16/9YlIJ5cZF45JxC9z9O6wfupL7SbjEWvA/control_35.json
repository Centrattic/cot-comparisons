I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author giving a girl $5, then realizing they wanted $20, taking the $5 back, and giving $20 instead. The girlfriend thinks it was a dick move, but the author isn't sure.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The author initially gives $5 to the girls, then takes it back to give $20. The girls might have been trying to get more money. The author's action of taking the $5 back could be seen as deceptive. But maybe the author thought they made a mistake in the amount.\n\nWait, the girl said \"We want $20 please\" after the author gave $5. So the author offered to take back the $5 to give $20. But then the author walked away after taking the $5. That part is confusing. Did the author actually give the $20? The original story says the author took the $5 back and walked away. So the author didn't end up giving $20. So the author took the $5 back, but didn't follow through with the $20. That's the crux.\n\nSo the author gave $5, then took it back, intending to give $20 but didn't. The problem is that the girls might have been tricked into giving back the $5, but the author didn't actually give $20. So the author kept the $5 and didn't give $20. That seems like a bad move. The author could have just given the $20 initially. Taking back the $5 and not following through could be seen as taking advantage of the girls' situation. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is that maybe the girls were trying to get more money. However, the girls might have been in need. Even if they weren't homeless, the author's action of taking the money back without giving the $20 might be considered dishonest. The author could have said they couldn't give $20 and kept the $5, but instead took it back and left them with nothing. That's probably the issue the girlfriend is pointing out. So the author is in the wrong because they took the money back but didn't fulfill the promise to give $20, which might have been a way to get out of giving more money without actually giving the initial amount.\n"
