I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation is about giving money to two girls and then taking it back when they asked for more.\n\nFirst, I need to break down what happened. The person gives $5 to a 12-year-old and her 6-year-old sister who asked for money. The girl initially asks for $20, but the person gives $5. Then the girl says they want $20, so the person takes the $5 back and walks away. The girlfriend says it's a dick move, but the author is unsure.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. If someone asks for money, and you give a smaller amount than requested, is it okay to take it back if they demand more? The key points here are intent and the situation of the individuals involved. The author thought the girls weren't in dire need (no shoes but still clean), so maybe they suspected it wasn't a genuine situation. \n\nHowever, the act of taking back the money after giving it might be seen as deceptive. When you give money, even if it's a smaller amount, the recipient might expect it to be a donation. If the person then takes it back under the pretense of giving a larger amount, that could be considered dishonest. The author might be exploiting their position of power here, especially if the girls were in a vulnerable position. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author might feel that the girls were not genuinely in need and were possibly soliciting more money than they actually needed. The author could be trying to avoid being taken advantage of. However, even if that's the case, taking back the money after giving it could still be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the ethical issue here is whether it's right to retract a donation once given, especially when the person gave the money in good faith (even if it was a small amount). If the girls were just trying to get more money, the author might feel justified, but the act of taking back the money could be perceived as manipulative. The author might not be in the wrong if they believed it was a scam, but the method of taking the money back could be seen as underhanded. \n\nI think the answer depends on the intent and the context. Since the author thought the girls weren't in genuine need, maybe they had the right to retract the donation. But in terms of social norms, once you give money, it's usually considered final. Taking it back might be seen as a poor move, regardless of the reasoning. So, there's a split here. The author's action might be understandable in their own mind, but from an ethical standpoint, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the girlfriend's reaction suggests that the author might be in the wrong because of the action of taking back the money. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's reasoning might be based on their perception of the situation, the act of taking back the money after giving it could be considered wrong because it's not customary to retract donations once given. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but there are arguments on both sides. However, the majority opinion might lean towards A because the action is seen as deceitful.\n"
