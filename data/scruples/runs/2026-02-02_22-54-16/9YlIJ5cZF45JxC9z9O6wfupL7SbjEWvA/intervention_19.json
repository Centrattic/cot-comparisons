I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by taking back the $5 after the girl initially asked for $5 but then changed her mind and asked for $20. The author gave the $5, then tried to take it back when the girl asked for more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author gave $5 voluntarily when the girl asked for money. Then the girl changed her request to $20. The author offered to take back the $5 and give a $20 instead. But then the author took the $5 back. The girlfriend says it's a dick move, but the user thinks the author is okay.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author have an obligation to give $20 after initially giving $5? Was the initial $5 a commitment, or was it a misunderstanding?\n\nIn terms of legal standpoint, if someone gives money voluntarily and then realizes they want to give a different amount, they can take back the money before a transaction is complete. There's no contract here; it's a spontaneous donation. The author isn't obligated to give more once the initial amount is given. However, socially, it might be seen as less generous or perhaps deceptive because the author gave the $5 and then tried to retract it when the request changed.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl changed her request after receiving the $5. The author's response was to correct the mistake by taking back the $5 to give $20. But since the author didn't actually follow through, maybe the girl felt tricked because she expected $20. But the author didn't actually give $20, so maybe the girl was confused or there was a misunderstanding.\n\nThe author's action of taking back the $5 could be seen as not being honest because they gave the money and then took it back. Even if the initial $5 was a mistake, once the money is given, taking it back might be perceived as dishonest. However, if the author believed they misunderstood the request (i.e., thought $5 was the correct amount but then realized the girl wanted $20), then correcting that by retrieving the $5 might be reasonable.\n\nBut from the other perspective, the girl was asking for money, and the author gave $5. Then when the girl asked for $20, the author's action of taking back the $5 could be seen as exploiting the situation. It might look like the author gave $5 to get the girl's approval and then retracted it when the demand was higher. This could be viewed as inconsiderate or manipulative.\n\nThe user's girlfriend thinks it's a dick move, which suggests that from a social standpoint, people might find this behavior less kind. However, legally, the author isn't in the wrong because there's no obligation in such a spontaneous encounter. But socially, it's a gray area. The author's actions might be seen as taking advantage of the situation, especially since the girls' appearance wasn't indicative of severe need. The author might be judged for not following through on the initial offer or for trying to renege after the request changed.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't legally at fault, the social implications are negative. Taking back the money after giving it might be seen as dishonest or inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong socially, but not legally. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given the context, it's a mix of both. The user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, but others might disagree based on social norms.\n"
