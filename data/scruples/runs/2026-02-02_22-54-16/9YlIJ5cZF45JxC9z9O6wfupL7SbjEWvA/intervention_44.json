I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person gave $5 to a kid who asked for money, then when the kid asked for $20 instead, they took back the $5 they gave. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move, but the author is unsure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The initial $5 was given in response to the kid asking for money. Then the kid changes the request to $20. The author takes back the $5, which might seem like they're being dishonest. But maybe they thought they made a mistake in giving $5 when the kid asked for more. However, once the $5 was given, the author can't just take it back because the child's request changed. That might be seen as a breach of trust. But the author might argue they were correcting a mistake. Also, the kids weren't in dire need, so the author might feel justified in not giving more. But taking back the money could be seen as rude or deceitful. It's a bit of a gray area. The author's actions could be viewed as wrong because they took back the money after the initial gift, especially if the child was expecting to keep it. But if the author believed they were mistaken in giving $5, maybe they have a point. I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong here because once money is given, retracting it could be considered dishonest.\n"
