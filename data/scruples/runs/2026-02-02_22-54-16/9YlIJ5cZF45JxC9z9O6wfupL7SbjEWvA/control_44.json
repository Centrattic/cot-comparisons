I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about giving money to two girls who asked for it, but then retracting the offer when they asked for more.\n\nFirst, the author gave $5 to a 12-year-old and her 6-year-old sister. Then the older girl said they wanted $20 instead. The author took back the $5 and walked away. The girlfriend thinks it was a dick move, but the author isn't sure.\n\nSo, the main question is whether taking the $5 back was wrong. The key points here are about intent and the interaction. When someone asks for money, the giver usually expects it to be a one-time act. If the recipient then asks for a different amount, does the giver have to honor that? \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong because they were offering money out of kindness, and the recipient's request changed. The author could have refused to give the $20, but by taking back the $5, they might be seen as trying to correct the initial mistake. However, the way it's phrased could be problematic. The author said, \"give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.\" That might come off as sarcastic or dismissive, especially if the girls were in need. \n\nThe girls looked untidy but not homeless. So maybe they were just asking for some money, not in dire circumstances. If the author had given the $5 with the intention of charity, the girls could have used it as they needed. But the author changed their mind when they asked for more, which might seem like taking advantage of their situation. \n\nWait, but the original $5 was given freely. The problem arises when the recipient asks for a different amount. The author's response could be seen as a way to correct the initial generosity. However, taking the money back after giving it might be perceived as rude or deceptive, depending on the context. If the author had known from the start they wanted $20, they could have given that instead. \n\nAlso, the age of the children matters. A 12-year-old might not be in a position to assess the situation properly. If they were just asking for a small amount and then upping the request, maybe the author thought they were being taken advantage of. But the act of taking back the money could be seen as a betrayal of trust. \n\nIn some cases, people might argue that once you give money, you can't take it back. The author's action might seem stingy or insincere. The girlfriend's perspective is that it was a dick move, which suggests she thinks the author acted poorly. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is that they were being asked for $20 initially, but gave $5 thinking it was enough. Then when the girl changed her mind, the author tried to take back the $5 to give the intended amount. However, this could be seen as the author giving the $5 to a child who might not be in a position to return it, which is questionable. \n\nAnother angle: the children might not have had the authority to ask for $20, or maybe they were just testing the person. The author's response could be a way to stop being scammed. But the initial $5 was given in good faith. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the intent. If they genuinely wanted to give $20 and mistakenly gave $5, taking it back to fulfill their intention is understandable. But if they gave $5 expecting to get it back when the request changed, that's more of a problem. \n\nThe answer would be A (wrong) if the author's action was considered deceptive or disrespectful. B (not wrong) if it's seen as correcting a mistake. Given the details, the author's action might be seen as a bit of a joke or trying to be clever, which could be perceived as a dick move, especially if the girls were genuinely in need. The girlfriend's reaction supports that. So maybe the answer is A.\n"
