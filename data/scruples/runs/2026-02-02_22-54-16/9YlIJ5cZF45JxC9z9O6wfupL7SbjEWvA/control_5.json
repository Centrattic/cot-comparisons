I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author gave a 12-year-old girl $5 as a donation, but then the girl asked for $20 instead. The author took back the $5 and left. His girlfriend thinks it was a dick move, but he's unsure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions. The author initially gave $5 out of kindness, probably expecting it to be accepted. When the girl asked for $20, maybe she was testing his generosity or wanted more. But why would she ask for $20 after taking the $5? Maybe she wanted to see if he would give more, or perhaps she was trying to scam him. \n\nThe author's action was to take back the $5 and leave. That could be seen as a reaction to being asked for more after an initial offer. But was it wrong? If the author felt pressured or that the request was unreasonable, taking back the money might be his right. However, giving back the $5 after already giving it could be seen as a betrayal of trust, especially if the girl was genuinely in need.\n\nBut the user mentions that the girls weren't in obvious distress. They were clean but untidy, not homeless. Maybe they weren't in real need. The author might have felt they were taking advantage of his generosity. If the girls were just asking for more money without a legitimate reason, the author's decision to retract his offer could be justified. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author gave the $5 with the understanding that it was a donation, the girl's request for more might not be a valid reason to take it back. It could be seen as a lack of follow-through on the initial act of kindness. The girlfriend's disapproval suggests that he should have either given more or not given at all, but taking back the money might come off as stingy or dishonest.\n\nAnother angle: the author might have felt manipulated, so taking back the money was a way to avoid being taken advantage of. However, in charitable giving, once you give, retracting it could be seen as unkind. The line here is blurry. If the author didn't want to give more, maybe he shouldn't have given the initial $5. Alternatively, if he felt the request was a ploy for more money, his action was a defense mechanism.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might depend on perspectives. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I need to decide if his action was morally wrong. If the girls weren't in dire need and the author felt they were trying to get more, then taking back the $5 could be justified as protecting his own money. However, if the author gave in good faith and then retracted without a valid reason, that's a problem. The key point is the girls' actual need. Since they weren't clearly homeless or impoverished, maybe the author's action was self-protective. So, answer B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
