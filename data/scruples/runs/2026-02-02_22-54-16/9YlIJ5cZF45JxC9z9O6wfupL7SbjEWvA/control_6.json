I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they gave a $5 bill to two girls who asked for money, but then the older girl said they wanted $20 instead. The author then took back the $5 and left. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move, but the author isn't sure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girls approached the author and asked for money. The author gave $5, which the older girl then dismissed as insufficient. The author tried to take back the $5 to give them $20 but the girl didn't return the $5. Then the author walked away.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author have an obligation to give them $20 after initially giving $5? The author gave $5 voluntarily, but then the girl changed their mind. Legally, once money is given as a gift, it can't be reclaimed. However, the author tried to take it back, which might be problematic. The author might have felt misled when the girl said they wanted $20 after receiving the $5. But was it ethical to take back the money?\n\nAnother angle: The girls might have been testing the person, seeing if they would give more. The author tried to correct their mistake but couldn't because the girl didn't return the $5. The author's action of taking back the $5 could be seen as taking advantage of the situation. However, the author might have felt they were being asked for more than they intended initially.\n\nAlso, the author mentions the girls were not in dire need (not homeless or impoverished). That might suggest the girls were perhaps trying to get more money by manipulating the situation. But the author gave the $5 freely first. The act of taking it back might be seen as a poor decision because once the money is given, it's theirs. The author's reaction could be seen as being inconsiderate or not trusting the initial request.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have thought they made a mistake in giving $5 when the girl later asked for $20, so they tried to correct it. But since the girl didn't return the $5, the author walked away. The author's action could be viewed as a bit of a cop-out, not wanting to give more and then trying to take back what they gave. That could be seen as inconsiderate or even dishonest.\n\nIn terms of social norms, if someone gives money and then realizes they want more, they can't demand the original money back. The author's attempt to retract the initial gift might be considered rude or unethical. The girlfriend's reaction supports that it was a dick move. So, the author might be in the wrong because they tried to take back the money after giving it, which is not appropriate once a gift is given voluntarily.\n\nBut some might argue that the author was trying to be helpful by offering $20 instead, but the problem is the girl didn't return the $5, so the author walked away. The author could have either given $20 or let the $5 stand. Taking back the $5 when the girl didn't return it might be the wrong move.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong because they tried to reclaim a gift they had already given. The answer might be A.\n"
