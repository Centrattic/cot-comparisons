I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person went to get pizza, then some kids asked for money. He gave them $5, but they wanted $20. Then he took the $5 back and left. His girlfriend thinks it was a bad move.\n\nFirst, when someone asks for money, the giver can decide how much to give. The kids might have been testing him, seeing if he'd give more. When he gave $5 and they said they wanted $20, he took back the $5. That could be seen as taking back what he gave because they didn't accept the offer. But maybe the kids were in need, and taking the money back left them with nothing. \n\nThe author mentioned they weren't homeless or poor, so maybe they were just trying to get more money than they needed. But is it wrong to take back your money once you've given it? If they asked for $20, maybe the author felt pressured and decided not to give any. However, taking back the money might look stingy or deceptive. On the other hand, if the person changed their mind, they might have a right to take back their money. \n\nThe key points are intent. The author gave $5 but the kids wanted more. He took back the $5 to give a higher amount, but then walked away. Maybe he thought they were trying to get more money, so he decided not to give anything after all. But taking the money back might have been a mistake because the kids might have needed the $5. \n\nAlso, the author's girlfriend is upset, which suggests there's a social expectation here. Some might see it as wrong to take back the money after giving it, even if the recipient asked for more. Others might say he's not obligated to give more than he wanted. \n\nI think it's a bit of a judgment call. If the kids were genuinely in need, taking back the $5 could be seen as mean. But if they were just trying to get more money and the author felt manipulated, he might not be in the wrong. The author's actions could be considered iffy, but maybe he's not entirely wrong. So, maybe answer B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
