I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is, they gave a 12-year-old girl $5, thinking it was a small donation. Then the girl asked for $20 instead. The author took back the $5 and walked away, and their girlfriend says that's a dick move.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions of the author. When someone offers money to a homeless or impoverished person, it's usually a charitable act. The author gave $5, which they felt was more than enough. But the girl then said they wanted $20. That's a bit odd because if they really needed help, they might not have asked for more after receiving a donation. \n\nThe author mentions the girls looked untidy but still clean, and not obviously homeless. Maybe they were just trying to get money for something specific. If the girl asked for $5 and then tried to negotiate for more, the author might have felt tricked. But was the author wrong to take the money back?\n\nOn one hand, the author might have made a mistake by not considering if the girls were in a legitimate need. If the author believed they were being asked for charity and then realized it was a higher amount, retracting the $5 could be seen as dishonest. They gave the money under the assumption that it was a small donation, and then took it back when the request changed. That could be perceived as taking advantage of the situation once they realized the girls might not actually be in need.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author might not have known the girls' true intentions. They gave the money with good faith, thinking it was a charitable act. When the girl changed the amount, the author might have felt uncomfortable and decided to back out. The key here is whether the girl's initial request was genuine. If the author thought they were helping someone in need, and then the request increased, it's possible the author felt misled. However, the act of taking back the money after giving it could be seen as rude or deceptive, even if the initial intent was good.\n\nAlso, the author's action might have been a quick reaction to a situation they found awkward. Maybe they weren't sure how to handle the increased request without appearing stingy. But taking the $5 back and replacing it with $20 could be a way to avoid giving more than they intended. However, the way they did it\u2014taking the $5 back and walking away\u2014might come off as abrupt or disrespectful. \n\nThe definition of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) usually hinges on whether the person acted in a way that's considered unethical or inconsiderate. The author gave money with the intent to help, but when the girl asked for more, they tried to correct their mistake. However, by taking the $5 back, they might have caused more harm or embarrassment. The alternative would have been to keep the $5 and just not give the $20, but the author chose to retrieve the money. That could be seen as manipulative or not trustworthy.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they gave the money in good faith and then tried to adjust based on a new request, maybe not. But the act of taking back the money after giving it might be seen as a dishonest move, especially if the recipient was expecting to keep the initial amount. It's possible the author's intention was to correct a mistake, but the method was poor. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) because taking back the money could be perceived as deceitful, even if the initial action was generous.\n"
