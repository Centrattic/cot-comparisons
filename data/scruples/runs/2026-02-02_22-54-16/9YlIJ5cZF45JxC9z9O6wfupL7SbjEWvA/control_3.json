I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person gave $5 to a girl who initially asked for money but then changed to $20. Then they took back the $5 and left. The question is whether they were wrong.\n\nFirst, when you give someone money, especially in a situation like this, they might feel you're committing to that amount. The girl asked for $5, then upped it to $20. The person offered to take back the $5 and give $20, but then walked away after taking the $5 back. That seems a bit manipulative, maybe. Because they gave the $5, then took it back under the condition of getting a larger amount, but then didn't follow through. So, maybe they were using the girls' request to get their money back. \n\nThe girlfriend thinks it's a dick move. The girls looked clean but maybe not in dire need. The person might have felt they were being taken advantage of, but then reacted in a way that's not honest. By taking back the $5 and not giving the $20, they might have been taking advantage of the situation. \n\nAlso, the act of giving $5 and then taking it back could be seen as insincere. If you're going to give money, maybe do so without conditions. Changing the amount after the initial request could be a tactic to get more, but the person's response seems to exploit that by not honoring their own offer. \n\nOn the other hand, if the person felt they were being scammed, maybe they had a reason to pull back. But the way they did it\u2014grabbing the $5 and walking off\u2014might come off as rude and not handling the situation gracefully. It's possible the girls were genuine, but the person's reaction was to retract their generosity without a clear reason, which could be inconsiderate.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the person might be in the wrong because they gave money with a change of heart, which could be seen as dishonest or inconsiderate. The answer might be A.\n"
