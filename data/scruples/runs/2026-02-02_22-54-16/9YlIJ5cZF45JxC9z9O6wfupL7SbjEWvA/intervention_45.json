I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves giving money to two girls, first $5 then taking it back after the older one asks for $20. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but they want to know the community's opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author gives $5 to a 12-year-old and her 6-year-old sister. The older girl then says they want $20 instead. The author takes back the $5 and walks away. The girlfriend says it's a dick move. The question is AITA (Am I the Asshole).\n\nSo, the key points here: The author gave $5, which the older girl then says they want $20. The author takes the $5 back and leaves. The girls looked \"untidy\" but \"not impoverished or homeless.\" \n\nNow, I have to consider different angles. On one hand, the author was kind enough to give $5. The older girl might be trying to get more money than initially offered. But the author felt they were being asked for $20 after already giving $5, so they took it back. \n\nBut wait, can you really take back money once given? If the author gave the $5 and then the girl said they wanted $20, the author might have realized they were being taken advantage of. However, in many cases, once money is given, it's considered a gift unless there was a specific agreement. If the $5 was given as an immediate donation, then the girl asking for $20 after the fact might be a scam. The author stepping back and retrieving the $5 could be seen as preventing further loss.\n\nOn the other hand, the act of taking back the money might come off as rude or insincere. The author might have thought they were being generous, but the older girl could be manipulating the situation. Also, the mention that the girls looked untidy but not necessarily in need might suggest that the author suspected they were not in genuine poverty, which could imply the author had second thoughts about the donation.\n\nAnother angle is the intent. If the author gave the $5 with the understanding that it was a one-time donation and the girl then upped the amount, the author had the right to refuse. But the act of taking back the money after it was given could be seen as dishonest, especially if the author didn't have a clear reason to believe they were being scammed. People might argue that once you give money, you can't just take it back. However, if there's a realization that the initial donation was part of a ploy to get more, then maybe it's justified.\n\nThe part where the author says, \"give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20\" might be a bit of a red flag. If they were trying to be helpful, they could have just given the $20. But by taking back the $5, it might come across as stingy or insincere. Alternatively, it could be a way to correct their mistake if they realized they were supposed to give $20 all along.\n\nBut the main issue here is whether the author's action was wrong. If the author felt they were being asked for more than intended and decided to retrieve the money to give the correct amount, that's one perspective. But if the author gave $5 out of genuine generosity and then took it back just to give a larger amount, maybe that's just being inconsistent. However, the key is that the author might have realized they were being set up. The description says the girls looked untidy but not homeless, which might indicate that they were not in genuine need, so the author might have been trying to avoid being taken advantage of.\n\nIn some cases, people might expect that if they start with a small amount, they can ask for more. The author might have wanted to stick to their original intention without being pressured. So, taking back the $5 could be a way to not be manipulated. \n\nHowever, others might argue that the author's initial action was generous, and then taking the money back could be seen as a bad move because it's not common to take back a donation. Unless there's a clear indication of fraud, which isn't mentioned here, it's a bit of a grey area. But given the description of the girls not looking impoverished, the author might have had doubts about their legitimacy as a charity case, which could justify retrieving the money to avoid giving to someone who might not be in genuine need.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong. They gave money initially, then realized they might be being asked for more than they intended or that the situation wasn't as legitimate as it seemed. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
