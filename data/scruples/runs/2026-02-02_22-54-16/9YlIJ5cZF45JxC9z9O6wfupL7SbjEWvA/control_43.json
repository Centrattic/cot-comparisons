I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person gave $5 to a girl who asked for money, but then the girl asked for $20 instead. The author took back the $5 and left. The girlfriend thinks it was a dick move. The question is whether the author was wrong.\n\nFirst, the initial act of giving $5 is generous. The girl then changing the request to $20 might have been unexpected. The author's response was to take back the $5 and offer $20, but walked away instead of following through. \n\nThe key points here are intent and expectations. When you give money, the recipient can't demand a different amount. The author might have felt tricked, but the girls' appearance (not impoverished) might make some people question their need. However, the act of taking back the money after giving it could be seen as insincere. \n\nSome might argue that once money is given, it's better not to retract it, as it could confuse or upset the recipient. Others might see the author's initial willingness to give more but then walking away as inconsistent. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that she thought it was rude to retract the money, which could imply that the author's action was seen as disrespectful or manipulative. \n\nBut the author's reasoning was that the girls weren't in dire need, so maybe the money wasn't given to someone in genuine need. However, the act of taking back the money might have been perceived as stingy or insincere. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. If the author felt the girls were scamming, maybe there's a justification, but the way it was handled could have been smoother. The answer depends on societal norms about charity and honesty. If the author didn't follow through on the promise to give $20, that's a point against them. But if the girls were trying to get more money by lying about their need, the author might have been cautious. \n\nGiven the information, the author might be seen as in the wrong because retracting the money after giving it could be considered dishonest or disrespectful to the children. The alternative is that the author was protecting their own money after realizing a potential scam. But with the girls' appearance not indicating poverty, the author might have overreacted. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (author is in the wrong) because once you give money, taking it back can be seen as a breach of trust, even if the initial intent was charity. The author's action might have been mean-spirited, even if they had their reasons.\n"
