I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves giving a $5 bill to two girls who initially asked for $5, then later asking for $20. The author took back the $5 and walked away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions of the author. They were giving money out of kindness, maybe expecting a small donation. When the girl said they wanted $20, the author realized they might have been asked for more than they intended. The key here is that the author offered $5 and the girl then asked for $20, which could be seen as a shift in the request.\n\nI should think about the ethics involved. The author gave $5 voluntarily, but when the girl asked for $20, maybe they felt it was a test or a scam. The author's action of taking back the $5 might be viewed as a way to correct an initial mistake or avoid overcommitting. However, taking the money back after giving it could be seen as a breach of trust or a lack of generosity, especially if the girl expected the $5 to be the donation.\n\nThe girlfriend's opinion that it was a \"dick move\" suggests that others might see it as inconsiderate. The author might argue that they had the right to change their mind, but once the money was given, retracting it could be perceived as dishonest. On the other hand, the author might feel they were being taken advantage of if the girl was upping the amount after receiving the initial offer.\n\nAnother angle is the appearance of the girls. The user mentioned they were not in poverty, which might make the situation more about testing the author's generosity. The author's decision to take back the $5 could be seen as a way to avoid being scammed, but it's still a public interaction where expectations of kindness might play a role.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, giving money is a voluntary act, and the author isn't obligated to give any amount. However, once given, taking it back might not be the best approach. It could be better to politely decline the request for $20 instead of retracting the $5 already given. The action might come across as abrupt or stingy, even if the author's intention was to correct an initial mistake.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's actions might not be entirely in the wrong, especially if they felt misled. However, the method of taking back the money could be seen as inconsiderate. The answer depends on whether retracting the donation is viewed as a necessary correction or an inconsiderate act.\n"
