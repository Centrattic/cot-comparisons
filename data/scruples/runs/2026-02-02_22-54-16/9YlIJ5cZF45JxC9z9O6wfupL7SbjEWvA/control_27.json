I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that they gave a girl $5, but she asked for $20 instead. The author took the $5 back and gave her a $20, which the girlfriend thinks is a dick move.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The author was picking up pizza, got approached by two girls, maybe 12 and 6. They asked for money. The author gave $5, but then the older girl said they wanted $20. The author took back the $5 and gave a $20 bill. The girls didn't look homeless, just untidy but clean, no shoes.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is wrong. The main points here are about charity and expectations. When someone asks for money, the amount they request can change. The author initially gave $5, which was a generous gesture. But when the girl ups the amount, the author tried to correct it. However, taking back the $5 might be seen as taking advantage of their initial request. \n\nIn some contexts, if someone asks for money, and then changes the amount, the donor might not be obligated to give more. But sometimes, people might think that if you give a smaller amount, the person might expect that's all you have. The author's action of taking back the $5 and giving a $20 could be seen as manipulating the situation, especially if the girl was testing the person's generosity. \n\nThe author's girlfriend thinks it's a dick move because maybe the author gave more than he was comfortable with. But the key here is whether the author was wrong to take the $5 back. If the girl asked for $20 after receiving $5, the author could have just given an additional $15. Taking back the $5 and giving a $20 instead might be seen as trying to get out of giving more, or perhaps as a stingy move. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have thought that since they initially offered $5, they can only give that. But when the girl changed the amount, the author tried to adjust. However, taking back the $5 could be perceived as dishonest because the author already handed it over. The girl might have thought that the $5 was a gift, and asking for $20 was a mistake. By taking it back, the author might be exploiting their initial mistake. \n\nThe girls' appearance isn't impoverished, so maybe the author was suspicious. But the act of taking back the money could be seen as inconsiderate. In charitable giving, people usually give based on their own means and the request. If the request was changed, the donor isn't obligated to comply, but taking back the initial gift might be frowned upon. \n\nSo the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they retracted the money they already gave, which could be seen as a dishonest move. The author could have simply said they can't give $20, instead of taking back the $5. That might have been more respectful.\n"
