I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the person gave a girl $5, but then the girl asked for $20 instead. The author took back the $5 and walked away. His girlfriend thinks it was a dick move, but he's unsure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person gave the $5 voluntarily, but then the girl changed her request. The key point here is whether the initial $5 was a gift or a loan. If it was a gift, the person is under no obligation to give more. If it was a loan, maybe there's an expectation to fulfill the request. But in this case, the person gave the $5 and then the girl asked for $20. The person then asked for the $5 back to give $20 instead. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. The girl's actions might be seen as trying to get more money by tricking the person. But when the person realized the mistake, he took back the $5 and left. The author didn't give any money, so maybe he's not at fault. The girlfriend's reaction is that it was a dick move, but maybe she's empathizing with the girls. However, the girls weren't in dire need according to the description\u2014they weren't homeless or impoverished. \n\nSo, the author's action was to retract the initial offer once he realized the girl's request was higher. If the person was being taken advantage of, retracting the offer is reasonable. Alternatively, if the girl was honest about needing $20 from the start, the person wasn't obligated to give more. The author's decision to take the $5 back and not give the $20 might be seen as being cautious, especially if the girl's need wasn't genuine. \n\nBut some might argue that once you give money, you can't take it back. However, in this case, the person gave the $5, the girl then asked for $20, so the person corrected the mistake. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer depends on whether the initial $5 was a gift or part of a larger request. Since the author didn't have a prior agreement, it's probably okay. The girls might have been trying to get more money, but the author's response was to not comply once he realized. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
