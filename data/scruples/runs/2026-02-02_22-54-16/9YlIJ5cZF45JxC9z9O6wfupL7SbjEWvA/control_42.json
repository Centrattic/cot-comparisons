I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for taking back money given to a child. They gave $5 to a 12-year-old girl who then asked for $20 instead. So they took the $5 back and said they'd give $20. The girlfriend thinks it was a dick move.\n\nFirst, the initial act: giving $5 to a child. Then the child changes the request to $20. The person complied by taking back the $5 and offering $20. But the girls weren't in obvious distress or poverty, just untidy but not homeless.\n\nSo, did the author act in bad faith? If the girl was just trying to get more money, maybe the author was protecting themselves. But giving money to a child who might be scamming could be seen as naive. However, the author tried to correct the mistake once the girl changed her mind. The girlfriend's reaction is a data point, but that's not the main issue.\n\nThe key is whether the author had the right to take back the money once the request changed. If the girl was trying to scam, the author was right to retract. But if the girl was just making a mistake or negotiating, taking back the money could be seen as dishonest. However, the context is that the girl initially asked for $5, then changed to $20. The author might have realized they were being taken advantage of, especially given the girls' appearance. So the author's action could be self-protective, but maybe the initial giving of $5 was a mistake. The question is if taking back the $5 was wrong. Since the transaction wasn't completed, and the person could reconsider, maybe it's not wrong. So answer B.\n"
