I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person gave $5 to a girl who then asked for $20. They took back the $5 and walked away. The girlfriend called it a dick move. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the initial act of giving $5 was generous. The girl then changed the request to $20. The author tried to correct the mistake by taking back the $5. But maybe that's where things went south. If the girl accepted the $5, maybe the author shouldn't have taken it back. However, the girl might have been manipulating the situation. If the author realized they were being taken advantage of, taking back the money could be justified. On the other hand, once the money was given, taking it back might be seen as stingy or rude. The key points are intent and the perception. The author's intent was to help, but the girl may have been seeking more than what was offered. The author's action of retrieving the money could be seen as a lesson to the girl, but it might have come off as abrupt. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that the author's response was unkind. Considering all this, the author's actions might be seen as necessary to avoid being taken advantage of, but the way they did it might be questionable. So, maybe the answer is B, but there's nuance.\n"
