I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're at fault for taking their $5 back after giving it to kids who asked for money. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the person gave $5 to a 12-year-old and her 6-year-old sister who asked for money. The older girl then said they wanted $20. The person offered to take the $5 back and give them $20 instead. But when they walked away, the girlfriend said it was a dick move. The person is unsure if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: giving money to kids, then taking it back when the request was higher than expected. The kids weren't in obvious distress, just maybe not in poverty.\n\nHmm. When someone asks for money, the giver can choose how much to give. If the person gave $5 and then the recipient wanted more, the giver isn't obligated to give more. But taking the $5 back might be seen as manipulative. Did the person have a legal obligation to give $5 in the first place? No. But once the $5 was given, taking it back could be problematic. \n\nWait, the person says they took the $5 back. Did the child have a right to keep the $5 after being given it? Once money is given and accepted, it's a completed transaction unless there's a prior agreement. But if the person took it back, maybe they tricked the child into giving it back. That could be a problem. However, in many places, if someone gives you money voluntarily, they can take it back unless there's a contract. But with minors involved, it's more complicated. \n\nAlso, the person's reasoning was that they thought $5 was enough, but the child wanted $20. So by taking the $5 back, they were trying to correct their mistake. But taking it back in front of the child might be seen as exploiting their inexperience. The kids might not understand that the person can just give a different amount. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is that it was a dick move, which suggests she thought the person was dishonest. The person might have been trying to be generous but overcorrected when the amount was higher than expected. However, the action of taking back the money to give more could be seen as a way to avoid feeling guilty or to correct a mistake. \n\nBut ethically, is it wrong to take back money once given? If the person gave it without any conditions, then taking it back could be seen as taking advantage of the child's trust. Even if the person had the right to take it back legally, morally it's questionable. \n\nOn the other hand, the person might not have intended to give money in the first place but felt pressured. The situation is a bit ambiguous. The person's actions could be seen as a lie because they gave the $5, then took it back, possibly making the child feel they were being tricked. \n\nIn conclusion, even if the person had the legal right to take back the money, the action was likely inconsiderate and dishonest, making them at fault. So the answer is A.\n"
