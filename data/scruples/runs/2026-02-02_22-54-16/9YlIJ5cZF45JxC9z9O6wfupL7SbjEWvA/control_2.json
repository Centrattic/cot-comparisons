I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves giving a child $5 and then walking away when the child asks for $20 instead. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions. The author initially gave $5, which the girl then says they actually want $20. The author takes back the $5 and leaves. The key points here are intent, deception, and whether the author acted in a wrong way.\n\nThe girl's request for more money could be seen as a test or a trick. The author gave $5 without being asked for a specific amount. When the girl then asks for $20, the author might be concerned about being scammed or not wanting to give more. However, the author didn't confirm if the girl was genuine in her initial request for $5. \n\nThe author's response was to take back the $5 and walk away. This could be seen as a way to avoid giving money to someone who might be manipulative. On the other hand, the author could have explained that they can't give more and offered the $5 as a gift, rather than taking it back. \n\nThe girlfriend's disapproval suggests that the author's action was abrupt. The girls weren't in obvious distress, which might influence the perception. However, the author might have felt uncomfortable or sensed something off. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a judgment call. The author is not in the wrong because they had the right to retract the money if they felt it was a scam. However, some might argue that the initial act of giving money and then taking it back could be seen as dishonest or cruel if the girl was genuinely in need. But since the girl's request for $20 might have been a test, the author's caution is understandable. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong because they acted to protect themselves from a potential scam without causing harm.\n"
