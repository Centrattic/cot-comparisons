I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person went to get pizza, got approached by two girls asking for money. They initially gave $5, but the older girl asked for $20 instead. Then the person took the $5 back and left. The girlfriend thinks it was a dick move, but the person isn't sure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The person gave $5 but then took it back when the girl asked for more. The argument is whether that's fair. The girls didn't look homeless or in dire need, so maybe the person felt they were being taken advantage of. But the person initially gave money, which is a kind gesture. Then changing their mind might be seen as inconsistent or dishonest. \n\nThe key points are: the person gave the $5, then took it back. If they didn't want to give money, maybe they shouldn't have given the $5 in the first place. Also, the girls might have been testing or trying to get more. But the person's action could be seen as stingy or not trustworthy. However, there's no mention of the person being coerced or tricked. The girl just asked for more after receiving the initial amount. \n\nAnother angle: when you give money, even if someone asks for more, taking it back might be rude. The person might have thought they could set a boundary, but the way they did it could be seen as inconsiderate. Especially since the girls were probably in need, even if not homeless. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests that the person's action was perceived as harsh. The person might have overstepped by taking back the money, leading to the girls being disappointed or feeling embarrassed. \n\nOn the other hand, if the person felt they were being asked for more than they intended to give, maybe there's some justification. But since they already gave the $5, taking it back could be seen as not following through on a kind act. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because taking back the money after giving it could be considered rude or inconsistent. They should have either given the $20 if they were willing or not given any at all. Changing their mind halfway might be the inconsiderate part.\n"
