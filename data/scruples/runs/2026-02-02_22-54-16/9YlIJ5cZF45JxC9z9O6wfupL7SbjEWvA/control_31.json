I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person gave a $5 bill to two girls, and when they asked for $20 instead, they took the $5 back. The girlfriend says it was a dick move. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the author gave $5, then the girl asked for $20. The author says they'll give $20 instead and take back the $5. The girls looked clean but maybe not in dire need. So, is this a problem?\n\nWell, giving money to someone in need is usually a good thing, but here the girls didn't seem homeless. The author might have thought they were just asking for more than they initially wanted. But taking back the $5 after giving it could come off as stingy or not being genuine. Because once you give the $5, changing your mind might not be the best approach. Maybe the author should have just given $20 if they were willing to, instead of taking back the $5. \n\nBut then again, maybe the author was just trying to give more. But the act of taking back the money might have been seen as mocking or not serious. The girls might have been testing the person. Also, the author's initial action was giving money, which is good, but the follow-up action of taking it back could be seen as rude. \n\nSo, the key points are: the author gave $5, then took it back to give $20. The problem is that once you give money, taking it back can be awkward. Maybe the author should have just given the $20 in the first place if they were going to. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that she thought it was a dick move, which might be because of the way the author handled it. \n\nI think the answer here is that the author is in the wrong (A) because taking back the money after giving it could be perceived as insincere or stingy, even if the intention was to give more. The act of taking it back might have been more hurtful than helpful.\n"
