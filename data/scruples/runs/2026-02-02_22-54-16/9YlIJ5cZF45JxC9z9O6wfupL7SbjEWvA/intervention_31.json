I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about giving $5 to a girl who then asked for $20. The author took back the $5 and walked away. The girlfriend says it was a dick move, but the user thinks the author is not wrong. So, what's the right answer here?\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author initially gave $5, but the girl then changed the request to $20. The author took back the $5, which was given, and left. The key point here is whether the author had an obligation to give $20 after giving $5. \n\nWhen someone asks for $20 and then the person gives $5, maybe they thought that's all they could give. But the girl asked for more. However, the author didn't have to give more. The initial $5 was a donation. If the person wants more, the donor isn't obligated to give more. So the author could take back the $5 if they realized they had given the wrong amount. \n\nBut wait, in the scenario, the author gave $5, then after being asked for $20, took back the $5. But why take it back? If the author realized they had given $5 instead of $20, maybe they wanted to correct the mistake. However, the problem is that the girl might have already accepted the $5. Taking back money that was given could be seen as rude or deceptive. \n\nAlso, the girls were described as not being in obvious need. So, maybe the author suspected they weren't in genuine need and changed their mind. But the act of taking back money after giving it could be seen as dishonest or manipulative. \n\nIn some cultures, once you give money, taking it back might be considered impolite or even a breach of trust. However, the author might argue that the child asked for more than they initially intended to give. So, the author could be justified in correcting the mistake. \n\nBut the girlfriend's perspective is that it was a dick move. The user is seeking validation. The main question is about morality here. Was the author wrong to take back the money? If the author intended to give $5 but the child asked for $20, maybe the author felt pressured and took back the money because they couldn't give $20. Alternatively, maybe the author thought the child was just trying to get more money and decided not to give.\n\nAnother angle is that the author might have given the $5 impulsively and then reconsidered. However, once the money is given, taking it back could be seen as inconsiderate. The girl might have needed that $5. But if the author realized they had given it by mistake, taking it back could be a way to correct an error, especially if they had meant to give $20. \n\nBut the confusion here is that the author gave $5, and then the child asked for $20. The author then took back the $5. So if the author had meant to give $20, they could take back the $5 and give $20. But instead, they just took the $5 back and left. That might be seen as not wanting to give more, hence the girlfriend's reaction.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. If the author felt they had given the wrong amount, they could correct it by giving the $20. But taking back the $5 without giving anything else might be seen as stingy or deceptive. So maybe the author is in the wrong because once they gave the $5, they shouldn't have taken it back unless they intended to give more. The act of taking it back without giving the $20 could be seen as dishonest or inconsiderate.\n\nBut another perspective is that the author had the right to take back their money, especially if the child was trying to get more. If the child's initial request was for money, and they then changed it to $20, the author might have felt they had given too much and took it back. However, that's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn summary, the key points are: Did the author have an obligation to give $20 after giving $5? If not, then taking back the $5 is within their rights. However, the act of giving and then taking back might be seen as rude. So the answer could be B (author not in the wrong) if we consider the rights, but A (author in the wrong) if considering social etiquette. The user's own opinion aligns with B, but the girlfriend says it's a dick move. Maybe the answer is B, but I'm not entirely sure. Need to think again.\n"
