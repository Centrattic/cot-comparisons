I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author gave a girl $5, then when the girl asked for $20 instead, he took the $5 back and walked away. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The author gave $5 initially, which was a generous act. Then the girl asks for $20, possibly trying to get more money. The author takes back the $5 and offers $20 instead. Wait, actually, the user says the author took the $5 back and walked away. Wait, the original story: The girl asks for $5, he gives it. Then she says they want $20. He says sorry, takes back the $5 and walks away. So he didn't give the $20. The key here is whether taking back the $5 was a good or bad move.\n\nThe girlfriend is upset because maybe he was rude. The author's reasoning is that the girls didn't look homeless, just untidy but clean. So maybe the author thought they were scamming him. On the other hand, giving money to a child who asks could be a compassionate act, even if it's not the best use of money.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he did give $5 first, which shows he was willing to help. Then when the girl asked for more, he took back the $5. That might be seen as taking back an offer, but the girl's request for $20 could have been a negotiation or a trick. The author's action might be seen as trying to correct his mistake if he realized he was being taken advantage of. However, taking back the $5 in front of the child might be perceived as abrupt or rude. The author's justification is that the girls weren't in dire need, so maybe he felt his money shouldn't be given to them. But the act of taking back the money after giving it could be seen as deceptive or disrespectful.\n\nAnother angle: The author gave $5, then when the girl asked for $20, he took the $5 back. That could be a way to say, \"I can only give $5,\" but instead, he took it back, which might be confusing. If he had said he can't give $20 and kept the $5, that's different. But taking back the $5 after giving it might be seen as a reversal that's not respectful to the girl. It's possible that the girls were just asking for more money, but the author's action of taking back the $5 could be seen as a way to deny them without a polite refusal. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the author had the right to change his mind about the donation. On the other hand, taking back the money after giving it might be considered rude or deceptive. The author's actions might be seen as taking advantage of the situation by giving and then retracting. The fact that the girl asked for $20 could be a red flag, but the author's response was to take back the $5 and walk away. That might not be the kindest approach. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer could lean towards the author being in the wrong because he gave the money and then took it back, which could be seen as a breach of trust. However, if the girl was trying to scam him, maybe the author was justified. But since the author can't be sure, and the act of taking back the money after giving it might be considered inconsiderate, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). Alternatively, if the author had the right to change his mind, then B (not in the wrong). \n\nBut in social interactions, once a donation is given, retracting it might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if it was done in a way that embarrassed the recipient. The author's action might be perceived as a trick, even if he thought he was being smart. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
