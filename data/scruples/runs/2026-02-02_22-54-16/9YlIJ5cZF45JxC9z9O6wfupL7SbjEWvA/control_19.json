I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see the situation. They were buying pizza, got approached by two girls, maybe 12 and 6. The older one asks for money, they give $5, then the girl says they wanted $20. The person takes back the $5 and walks away. His girlfriend says it was a dick move, but he's unsure. The girls weren't in obvious need.\n\nFirst, giving money to someone who asks for it is a kind gesture, but not an obligation. If the person realized they wanted more, maybe they should have asked again. But the person took back the $5 after being asked for $20. Wait, why would they take back the money? Like, the girl said they wanted $20 instead of $5. So he gave them $5, then after she said they wanted $20, he took the $5 back. That seems a bit odd. Maybe he felt taken advantage of? But why give the $5 in the first place if he was willing to give $20. Or maybe he was trying to be helpful but then realized the amount was insufficient. \n\nBut the girls looked untidy, not homeless. Maybe they were just asking for money for something trivial. The person might have thought they were being asked for a specific amount. If the girl first asked for money, and he gave $5, then said they needed $20, maybe the person felt manipulated. Taking back the $5 could be seen as a way to not overcommit, but maybe it was rude because the person gave the $5 in good faith and then retracted it. \n\nI think part of the issue is that once you give money, you can't take it back unless the person agrees. If the girl was going to change her request, maybe she should have said so before accepting the money. But once the $5 was given, taking it back might be seen as not trustworthy. However, the person might not have intended to give $20, so when the girl asked for more, he took back the $5 to not be taken advantage of. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is that it was a dick move. Maybe because giving money is a generous act, and retracting it after giving it could be seen as a betrayal. But if the person realized the amount was insufficient, maybe they had the right to take it back. But in reality, once the money is given, taking it back might be considered unethical even if the initial request was vague. \n\nSo, the person might be in the wrong because they gave the money, then took it back after the girl asked for more. It could be seen as a lack of trust or a way to avoid giving more. Alternatively, they might not be in the wrong if they felt the girl was trying to get more money after the fact. But usually, once you give money, you can't just take it back unless there's a mutual agreement. So maybe the person should have just said they couldn't give $20 instead of taking back the $5. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because taking back the money after giving it could be seen as a dishonest or rude action. The person gave the $5, then retracted it, which might have made the girls feel embarrassed or taken advantage of. Even if the girls were asking for more, the proper action would be to decline the higher amount and keep the initial donation. Taking back the money could be considered a breach of trust.\n"
