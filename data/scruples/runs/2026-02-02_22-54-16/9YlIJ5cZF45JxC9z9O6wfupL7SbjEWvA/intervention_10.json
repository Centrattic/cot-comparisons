I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the person gave a girl $5, but then the girl asked for $20 instead. The person took back the $5 and walked away. The girlfriend thinks it was a dick move, but the author isn't sure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person gave $5 initially, thinking it was enough. The girl then asked for $20. The person took back the $5 and left. The girls were described as not being in dire need, just maybe not in poverty.\n\nSo, was the person wrong? Well, when someone asks for money, it's a request. The person didn't have to give them anything, and they were within their rights to reevaluate their decision. The girl changed the original request, which might have been a test or manipulation. The person isn't obligated to give more than they were willing to. \n\nBut maybe the issue is about the manner in which they took back the money. The person took the $5 back and walked away. That could be seen as abrupt or disrespectful. However, the person wasn't forced to give the money in the first place. They had the right to reassess their offer. The girls might have been trying to see if they could get more money by changing their request.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the person could have handled it more politely. Instead of taking the $5 back, they could have said they couldn't give more. But the person's action of taking back the money wasn't necessarily wrong. They didn't have to give more, and they were correcting their initial mistake.\n\nAnother angle: the girls might have been testing the person. If they looked clean and not homeless, maybe they weren't in genuine need. The person's action could be seen as catching them in a manipulation tactic. So the author might not be wrong because they adjusted their offer when the request changed.\n\nIn conclusion, the person took back the money because the request changed. They weren't wrong for doing so, even if their approach was a bit brusque. They had the right to decide how much to give, if any. The answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
