I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking back the money after giving it to the girls.\n\nSo the situation is: the author was buying pizza and gave $5 to a 12-year-old and her 6-year-old sister who asked for money. Then the older girl asked for $20 instead. The author took back the $5 and left. The girlfriend thinks it was a dick move, but the user thinks the author isn't wrong.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the ethical implications here. When someone asks for money, and you give them a smaller amount than they want, but then they demand more, is it okay to take back the initial amount?\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, there's no issue. The author had the right to give the money and then retract it if they changed their mind. But the question is about being in the wrong morally or socially.\n\nThe girls weren't homeless or in obvious distress, according to the author. They were just asking for money. The author gave $5, which the older girl then said wasn't enough. Maybe the author felt pressured or realized they might have been asked for more. But by taking back the $5, they might have come off as insincere or manipulative.\n\nWait, the author gave $5, then took it back. If the girl asked for $20, maybe the author was trying to be generous by saying they'd give $20 instead, but then walked away. However, the key point is that the author took back the $5. That could be seen as stingy or not genuine. People who ask for money might not expect to get the full amount, but taking back the initial gift could be hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have realized the girls weren't in genuine need and decided not to give more. But taking back the initial $5 might have been a mistake because once you give money, it's a gesture of goodwill. Retracting it could be seen as dishonest or disrespectful, especially to children.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests that the behavior was perceived as rude. Social norms often expect that if you give something, you don't take it back. So the author might have overstepped by repossessing the money after giving it, even if the initial intent was to give more.\n\nBut the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Maybe the user's reasoning is that the author had the right to change their mind. However, the social expectation is that once you give money, it's a done deal. Taking it back could be seen as inconsiderate, especially to children.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because taking back the money could be seen as a breach of trust or kindness, even if the initial act was a mistake. The author could have just said they can't give $20 and kept the $5 given, but taking it back was a poor choice.\n"
