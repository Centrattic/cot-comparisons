I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for taking back the $5 after the girl asked for $20.\n\nFirst, the author gave $5 to the little girl, who then said they wanted $20. The author took back the $5 and gave nothing. The girlfriend thinks it was a dick move. \n\nSo, when someone asks for money, maybe expecting a larger amount, but the person gives a smaller amount. Then the recipient is upset and asks for more. The author takes back the initial amount. \n\nIs this acceptable? Well, if the author didn't have the intention to give $20, maybe they shouldn't have given $5 in the first place. But on the other hand, the girl asked for $20, so the author might have thought they were being asked for a specific amount. \n\nBut when you give money to someone in need, they might not have the right to reject it if it's less than they wanted. The author gave $5, then took it back because the girl said they wanted $20. That could be seen as stingy or not trustworthy. \n\nWait, but the girls didn't look homeless. They were untidy but clean, no shoes. Maybe they were just kids asking for money for something else. The author might have felt they were being asked for more than they wanted to give. \n\nBut once you give money, you can't take it back. If the girl was upset because she wanted more, that's on her. But the author's action of taking back the $5 could be seen as rude, as the girl might have expected a larger amount but the author changed their mind. \n\nBut maybe the author didn't have the intention to give $20. The initial $5 was given, but when the girl said they needed $20, the author realized they didn't want to give that much. So they took back the $5. \n\nHowever, in such situations, once you give money, it's theirs. Taking it back could be seen as inconsiderate. Especially if the child was expecting a larger amount. The author might have misjudged the situation. \n\nThe key point is whether the author had the right to take back the money after giving it. Legally, it's not a contract, so they can. But morally, it's questionable. The author might have felt pressured when the girl asked for more, so took back the money. \n\nIn summary, the author might not be in the wrong because they were acting on their own decision, but it's a social faux pas. However, considering the context, the answer depends on whether taking back the money is seen as acceptable. Since the author gave $5, then took it back because the girl asked for $20, which the author wasn't willing to give, I think the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
