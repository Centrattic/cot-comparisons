I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about giving money to two girls and then taking it back when they asked for more.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author gave $5 to a girl who initially asked for money. The girl then said they wanted $20. The author took back the $5 and left. His girlfriend thinks it was a dick move. The girls looked clean but not necessarily in poverty.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, giving money out of kindness is a personal choice. When the girl asked for $20 after he gave $5, he might have felt misled. Taking back the $5 could be seen as a way to correct the situation if he felt pressured into giving more. However, some might argue that once he gave the $5, taking it back was rude or deceptive. Others might say he had the right to change his mind, especially if he realized he was being asked for more than he intended.\n\nThe key points are intent and perception. The author might have thought he was being manipulated into giving more. On the other hand, the act of taking back the money after giving it could be seen as a breach of trust. The girls' appearance (not homeless) might make the situation seem like they were begging for non-essential reasons, which could influence the judgment.\n\nIn terms of social norms, some people believe in giving what you can without expecting more. Others might think it's okay to adjust if there's a misunderstanding. The author's action might be seen as stingy or as correcting a mistake. The girlfriend's reaction suggests it's a sensitive issue.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might hinge on whether the author's intent was to be generous but then had a change of heart due to the increased request. Since the girls didn't have a clear need (they weren't homeless), he might not be in the wrong for reconsidering. But taking back the money could be seen as inconsiderate. However, ultimately, it's about personal choice and how the situation was handled. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he had the right to adjust his decision, even if the manner was questionable.\n"
