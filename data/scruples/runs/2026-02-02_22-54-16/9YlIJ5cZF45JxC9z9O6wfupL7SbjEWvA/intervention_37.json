I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by taking back the $5 after the girl asked for $20 instead. So the situation is, the author gave $5 to a girl who initially asked for money, but then the girl wanted $20. The author took back the $5 and left. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move, but the user is unsure.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. When someone asks for money, it's typically an open request. The author gave $5, which is a generous gesture. Then the girl asked for $20. The author tried to correct the mistake by taking back the $5 to give $20. But maybe there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, the author handed over $5 and then the girl said they wanted $20. So the author took back the $5 and walked away. The key points here are the initial generosity and then the change in request. But perhaps the girl was negotiating? Or maybe she was trying to get more than the author was willing to give. \n\nThe user's girlfriend thinks it's a dick move because the author took back the money after giving it. But if the girl was asking for a different amount, maybe the author was justified in correcting the mistake. However, the act of taking back the money after giving it could be seen as rude. People might expect that once you give a donation, you don't take it back unless there's a specific reason. \n\nAlso, considering the girls' appearance: they were not in poverty, had no shoes but were clean. Maybe the author thought they weren't in genuine need, but that's a bit of a judgment. If the author thought they were faking, that's another angle. But the author's action was to take back the $5 instead of giving $20. So maybe the author felt they were being taken advantage of. \n\nBut the problem is, when someone gives money, it's a donation. If the recipient changes their request, does the donor have to comply? Probably not. The author could have said, \"I can give $5, but not $20.\" Instead, the author gave $5, then the girl asked for more, and the author took back the $5. That might be seen as dishonest because it's taking back a gift after the fact. \n\nAlternatively, the author might have thought they were mistaken in giving $5 and wanted to correct it. But once a gift is given, retracting it could be considered rude. So in that case, the author might be in the wrong. \n\nBut then again, if the girl was trying to get more money than the author was willing to give, the author's action was to correct the mistake. However, the way it's done matters. Maybe the author should have just said they can't give $20 instead of taking back the $5. \n\nSo, considering social norms, giving a gift and then taking it back could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong. But there's also the aspect of the girls' intentions. If they were trying to scam, the author's action could be justified. But the user didn't mention any evidence of that. \n\nIn the end, the consensus is probably that taking back the money after giving it is rude, so the author is in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
