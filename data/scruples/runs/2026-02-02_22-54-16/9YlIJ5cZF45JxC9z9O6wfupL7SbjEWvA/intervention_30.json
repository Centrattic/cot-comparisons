I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author was giving money to a girl and her younger sister who asked for spare change. Initially, the author gave $5, but then the older girl asked for $20 instead. The author took back the $5 and left. Now, the author is questioning if this was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. When someone asks for money, it's typically an act of charity or kindness. The author gave $5, which the girl then said wasn't enough. The author decided to take back the $5 and not give $20. \n\nWhy would the author do that? Maybe they felt the initial $5 was a good contribution, and not obligated to give more. But the girl's reaction might have been unexpected. The author might have felt disrespected or like the girl was manipulating them by asking for more after receiving the initial amount. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have left the $5 as is and not taken it back. Taking it back after giving it might seem like a reversal, which could be seen as abrupt or inconsiderate. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that the author's action was perceived as rude. \n\nLooking at the context: the girls were not in obvious distress or need. They were clean but untidy, not homeless. The author might have given the $5 out of goodwill, expecting it to be accepted. When the girl asked for more, the author might have felt it was a ploy to get more money, so taking it back was a way to not be taken advantage of. \n\nHowever, taking back the money after giving it could be seen as a breach of trust. The author might have thought the girl was genuine in her initial request. Then, when she asked for more, it felt like a trick. The author's action could be justified as protecting their own resources, but maybe the way they did it was abrupt. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the act of giving money is a voluntary exchange, once the money is given, the recipient can decide how to use it. The author taking it back might have made the girls feel embarrassed or disrespected. Alternatively, the author might have felt misled, so it's a matter of perspective. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people might expect that once you give money, you don't take it back. The author's action could be seen as a social faux pas, hence the girlfriend's reaction. But if the author felt they were being scammed, maybe their response was a defense mechanism. \n\nIn summary, the situation is ambiguous. The author's intentions and the girls' actions both play a role. The key point is whether taking back the money was a reasonable response. If the author believed they were being asked for more after giving, it's a valid concern. But the method of taking it back might have been unkind. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but there's room for different opinions. Given the options, I'd lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author had the right to reconsider, though the execution could be smoother.\n"
