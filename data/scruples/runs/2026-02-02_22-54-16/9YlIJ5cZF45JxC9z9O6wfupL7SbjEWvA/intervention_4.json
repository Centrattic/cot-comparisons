I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about giving $5 to two girls who asked for money, then taking it back when they asked for $20 instead.\n\nFirst, the initial act of giving $5 is kind, right? The writer was approached by two girls, probably in need. They gave $5 as a donation. But then the older girl says they want $20. The writer then takes back the $5 and offers a $20 bill instead. \n\nWait, why did they ask for $20 after receiving $5? Maybe they were trying to get more money. The writer might have realized they were being taken advantage of. The key point here is whether the girls were genuinely in need or just trying to get more money. The user mentions they looked untidy but not homeless. That's an important detail. If they weren't in dire need, maybe the writer was right to take back the money.\n\nThe girlfriend says it was a dick move. But maybe she's not considering the context. The writer didn't give the $20 because the girls changed their request. If the girls were trying to manipulate him into giving more, taking back the $5 to give $20 might not be the right approach. Alternatively, maybe he should have given $5 and not offered the $20. But the writer might have realized they were being scammed and wanted to correct the mistake.\n\nAnother angle: when you give money as a donation, the recipient isn't supposed to demand a specific amount. If the girls changed their mind after receiving the initial amount, the writer could have walked away instead of trying to take back the money. But in this case, he might have thought he was correcting his mistake by giving the correct amount they asked for. However, once money is given, it's theirs. Taking it back could be seen as unethical, even if the recipient is trying to get more.\n\nBut wait, maybe the girls were using the $5 as a way to get him to part with his money, then upping the request. The writer realized this and took back the $5 to avoid over-giving. That could be seen as self-preservation. However, taking back the money after it's been given might not be the best approach. Perhaps he should have just refused the $20 and kept the $5 as a donation.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often expect that if you give money, it's a final donation. If the recipient then asks for more, the donor isn't obligated to give more, but taking back the initial amount could be seen as rude or distrustful. On the other hand, if the donor realized they were being taken advantage of, maybe it's understandable.\n\nThe key factors here are the intentions of the girls and the social expectations around giving. If the girls were genuinely in need and the writer thought he was giving the right amount, but they then asked for more, maybe he shouldn't have taken back the money. However, if the girls were manipulative, taking back the $5 could be justified. The description says they were not impoverished, which might suggest they were testing the situation.\n\nIn conclusion, the writer might not be in the wrong because he realized the girls weren't in genuine need and corrected his mistake. But some might argue that once he gave the money, it's theirs to do with as they please. However, since he took it back to give the correct amount they asked for, maybe it's a bit of a gray area. But considering the context, the answer is probably B.\n"
