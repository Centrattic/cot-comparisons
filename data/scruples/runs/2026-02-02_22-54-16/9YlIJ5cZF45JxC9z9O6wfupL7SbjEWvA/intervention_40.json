I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person gave $5 to a girl who asked for money. The girl then says they actually wanted $20. The author takes back the $5 and gives nothing else. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the initial act: giving $5 is a charitable act. The girl changes the amount asked, which might be considered manipulative. The author's response is to retract the $5, which could be seen as dishonest because they might have given the $5 expecting it to be the final amount. But maybe the author felt tricked into giving more than intended. However, taking back the money after handing it over could be seen as breaking a promise. \n\nAlso, the author mentions the girls weren't in dire straits. So maybe the author felt the request was insincere. The girlfriend says it was a dick move, but others might argue the girl's actions were deceptive. The key points are whether the author had an obligation to give more once they gave the initial $5. Since the author didn't agree to $20 upfront, they might not be wrong for changing their mind. However, taking back the money might be seen as stingy or dishonest. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl asked for money, got it, then changed her request. The author's reaction could be a way to avoid being taken advantage of. Maybe the author felt pressured into giving more, so retracting the initial offer makes sense. But in charity, once you give, it's hard to take back. So there's a social expectation that once you give, you can't ask for it back. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for rescinding the money after giving it, unless there was a clear misunderstanding. But the girl's behavior was manipulative. The author's action could be seen as self-preservation. It's a tricky situation. If the girl had asked for $20 initially, the author might not have given anything. But since she asked for $5 first, the author gave, then changed the request. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author had the right to take back the money once given. In social norms, once a gift is given, it's considered a completed act. However, if there was a misunderstanding, maybe it's acceptable. The author might not be in the wrong because they were tricked into giving more than intended. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
