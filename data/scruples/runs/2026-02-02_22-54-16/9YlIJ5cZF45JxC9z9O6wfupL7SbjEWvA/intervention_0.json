I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person gave the kids $5, then when the kids asked for $20 instead, they took back the $5. The question is whether that's wrong.\n\nFirst, when you give someone money, it's usually a gift unless there's an agreement. The kids initially asked for money, maybe expecting a smaller amount. The person gave $5, but the older girl then said they wanted $20. So the initial $5 was given, and then they changed their request.\n\nBy taking back the $5, the person is essentially retracting the gift. But is that fair? If there's no prior agreement, a gift can't be taken back once given. So maybe the person is wrong because once the $5 was given, taking it back might break trust. Plus, the kids might have felt tricked or disappointed.\n\nBut on the other hand, the person might have thought it was a misunderstanding. They might have realized the kids wanted more, so they tried to correct the mistake. However, if the $5 was already given, taking it back could be seen as inconsiderate. The person could have just said sorry and offered $20 instead, but instead they took back the $5, which could be seen as a manipulative move.\n\nAlso, the person's girlfriend thinks it's a dick move, which suggests that socially, it's not seen as a good action. The kids were not in dire need, so the person might have been trying to be charitable but ended up being inconsiderate by taking back the money. \n\nIn ethical terms, once a gift is given, retracting it can be seen as wrong because the recipient might have accepted it in good faith. The person might have overstepped by taking back the money after the fact. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
