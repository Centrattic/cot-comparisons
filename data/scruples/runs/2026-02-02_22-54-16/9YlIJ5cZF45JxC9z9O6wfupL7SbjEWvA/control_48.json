I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about giving money to a kid and then taking it back. \n\nFirst, the person initially gives $5 to a 12-year-old and her 6-year-old sister who asked for money. Then the girl asks for $20 instead. The author takes back the $5, gives a $20, and walks away. The girlfriend thinks it was a dick move. The question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about intent and perception. When someone asks for money, and the initial offer is made, changing the request after receiving the money might be seen as manipulative. But the author didn't give the $20 yet; they took back the $5. So maybe the kid changed her mind. But is that the case here? The girl said \"We want $20 please\" after getting $5. Wait, the author gave $5, then the girl said they wanted $20. So the author offered to take back the $5 and give $20 instead. But then the author took the $5 back and walked away without giving the $20. \n\nWait, the user says they took the $5 back. So the original transaction was: author gives $5, girl says they want $20. Author says sorry, takes back the $5, and walks away. So the author didn't give the $20. The author's action was to rescind the initial $5 and not fulfill the $20. \n\nIs this a dick move? Well, when someone asks for money, and you give a smaller amount, then they ask for more. The author might feel that the initial request was genuine, but the kids upped the amount. If the author thought it was a genuine need, taking back the money could be seen as not being generous. But the author might feel that they were being manipulated. However, the initial act was charitable. Once the money is given, taking it back might be perceived as rude or inconsiderate. \n\nThe girlfriend says it's a dick move because you can't take back your money after you've given it. But the author might argue that the children were trying to get more than they asked for. However, the children might not have realized the implications. The author could have said no to the $20 request instead of taking back the $5. \n\nIn terms of social norms, once you give a gift or donation, retracting it can be seen as impolite. The author might not be in the wrong if they felt they were being taken advantage of, but the action of taking back money after giving it could be seen as wrong. The children's appearance was clean but untidy, so maybe the author thought they weren't in real need. However, the act of taking back the money could be seen as insincere. \n\nSo the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because once you give money, taking it back could be seen as a breach of trust or inconsiderate. Alternatively, if the children were manipulative, the author could be justified. But the situation is unclear. The key is whether taking back the money after giving it is wrong. Since the author took back the $5, which the girl already accepted, then walked away without giving the $20, that might be seen as taking back a gift, which is not appropriate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
