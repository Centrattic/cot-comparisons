I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author gave a kid $5, but then the kid asked for $20 instead. The author took back the $5 and left. His girlfriend says it was a dick move, but he's unsure.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author initially gives $5 to a girl and her younger sister, probably on a whim. Then, the girl asks for $20, so the author takes back the $5 and walks away. The key points here are the initial action of giving money and the subsequent reaction when the request was higher.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the girls didn't look impoverished or homeless, just untidy but clean. So he might be thinking they weren't in genuine need. But the problem is, if someone asks for money, even if you suspect they're not in real need, giving it back because they asked for more might not be the best approach. Let's consider the perspective of the author and the girls.\n\nFrom the author's side: He gave $5, then realized the girl wanted $20. He took it back, which could be seen as stingy or distrustful. But maybe he felt misled or didn't want to give more. However, taking the $5 back after already giving it might be abrupt and unkind. The girl might have expected to keep the initial amount and not have it taken away just because the request was higher. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not be obligated to give more than he wanted. If he didn't want to give $20, he could have just said no instead of taking back the $5. Taking the money back could be perceived as rude or not trusting the girl's initial request. The act of giving and then retracting might be seen as a bit of a jerk move because the girl was expecting to keep the money he already gave, regardless of her asking for more. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is that it was a dick move. That's a red flag. Maybe the author should have just politely declined the $20 request without taking back the $5. People often ask for donations and might not expect the giver to provide all the money they want. The initial $5 was a gift, so taking it back after giving it could be seen as dishonest. \n\nAlso, the girls' appearance: no shoes but still clean. That might suggest they're struggling, even if not homeless. The author's assumption that they aren't in need could be incorrect. Even if they were scamming, the author's action of taking back the $5 could be seen as harsh. It's better to give if you can, rather than take back a small amount. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he gave money initially, which was kind. But when the girl asked for more, he took back the original amount. This could be considered selfish or a bad move because the girl might have needed that $5, and he's taking it back under the pretense of providing more. The correct approach would be to either give the $20 if he wanted to or politely decline without taking back the $5. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he took back the money after giving it, which can be seen as dishonest or inconsiderate, especially if the girls were in need. Even if the author suspected they weren't in genuine need, retracting the gift in that manner is rude.\n"
