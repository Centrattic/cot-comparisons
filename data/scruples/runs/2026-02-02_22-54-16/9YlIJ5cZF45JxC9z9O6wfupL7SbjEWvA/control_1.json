I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author gave a five-dollar bill to two girls who asked for money, but then the older one asked for twenty. So the author took back the five and left.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author initially gave $5, which is a kind gesture. The girl then asks for $20, which is more than the initial offer. The author takes back the $5 and leaves. The girlfriend thinks it was a dick move, but the author isn't sure. The key points here are intent, honesty, and whether the author's actions were appropriate.\n\nLegally, once the author gave the $5, it belonged to the girls. However, the author took it back under the pretense of providing more money. That might be deceptive because the author didn't actually give $20. So, the act of taking back the money after the transaction might be questionable. The author's motivation could be that they changed their mind or felt pressured by the request for more money. But taking back the money after giving it might be seen as dishonest because the author didn't follow through with the $20 and didn't return the $5 to the girl's hand. Instead, the author just took the $5 back without giving anything else.\n\nEthically, when someone gives money as a donation, they can't take it back once it's been given. The author's action of taking it back might be seen as taking advantage of the situation. The girls might have felt confused or upset if the author didn't actually give the $20. Also, the description mentions the girls weren't in obvious distress, which might lead some to think the situation wasn't a genuine need, but that's speculative.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author's action of retrieving the $5 was wrong. If the author realized they were being taken advantage of, maybe they have a point, but the method of taking back the money was questionable. The author could have just said no to the $20 request without taking back the initial $5. So the deception part might be the key here. Taking back the money might be seen as a lie because the author didn't actually intend to give $20 but used that as an excuse to get the $5 back.\n\nIn summary, the author's action could be considered wrong because they gave the money and then took it back deceptively. They didn't return the $5 properly, leading to a dishonest transaction. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no other angle. Maybe the author thought they were being scammed, but the girls might have genuinely needed the money. Either way, the act of taking back the money without returning it properly is the issue here.\n"
