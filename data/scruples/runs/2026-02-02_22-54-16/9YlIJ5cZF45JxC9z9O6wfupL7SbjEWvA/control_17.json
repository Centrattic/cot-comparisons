I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong.\n\nSo the scenario is that the author was buying pizza, got approached by two girls. The older one asked for money, maybe around $5. Then the younger one said they wanted $20. The author gave them $5, but then tried to take it back because the younger girl asked for more. The girlfriend says it was a dick move. The question is, was the author in the wrong?\n\nFirst, I need to think about the actions here. The author initially gave $5, probably out of goodwill. The younger girl then asked for $20. The author took back the $5 and offered to give $20 instead. But then walked away. \n\nSo, the key points here are: giving money out of charity, then retracting it when the request changes. The girls were not in obvious distress or homeless, according to the author. The girlfriend thinks it was wrong to take back the money. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, when you give money as a donation, you can't just take it back because the person asks for more. But maybe the author felt pressured? The problem is that once the money is given, it's theirs. The author might have felt tricked, but the situation is a bit different because it's a charitable giving situation. \n\nBut wait, the author didn't actually give the $20. They took back the $5 and walked away. The initial $5 was given, then they tried to renegotiate. That might not be a good move. Because the girls might have expected the $5 and were then confused when the author took it back. \n\nAlso, the author might have perceived the girls as being manipulative, but since they weren't homeless or in obvious need, maybe the author should have considered that they were just trying to get more money. But is it the author's fault? \n\nIn terms of social norms, once you give money, it's considered a completed act. Taking it back could be seen as rude or dishonest. The author might have felt they were being played, but the way to handle that would be to not give in the first place if they felt uncertain. \n\nSo, the author's action of taking back the money might be seen as inconsiderate. Even if the girls were trying to get more, the author's response wasn't appropriate. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But wait, the user is asking for an answer between A and B. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, if the author felt they were being manipulated, maybe it's not entirely their fault. But the key is that once you give money, you can't just take it back. The author might have been trying to be fair by offering $20, but walking away after taking back the $5 could be seen as not being genuine. \n\nSo, the consensus here is that the author's action of taking back the money is inconsiderate. The answer would be A. The author is in the wrong.\n"
