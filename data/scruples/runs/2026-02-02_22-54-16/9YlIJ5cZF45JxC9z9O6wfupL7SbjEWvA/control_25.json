I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about giving money to two girls and then taking it back when they changed their request.\n\nFirst, the author gave $5 to a girl, then when the girl asked for $20 instead, he took the $5 back. His girlfriend thinks it's a dick move. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nSo, when he gave the $5, it was a generous act, right? But when the girl changed her mind and asked for more, he tried to correct his mistake by getting the $5 back. The girls weren't in obvious distress or need. They were just asking for money, maybe for a specific reason. \n\nThe key points here: The author gave money with the understanding that it was $5. When the girl asked for $20, he realized he might have misunderstood or that they wanted more. By taking back the $5 and offering a $20 bill instead, he might have been trying to do the right thing by giving the exact amount they asked for after the initial mistake.\n\nBut here's the catch. Once you give someone money, especially in a charitable context, they have a right to keep it. Taking it back could be seen as going back on your word. The author might have thought he could correct the mistake, but the girls might have felt misled or tricked. Also, the author's action of taking the $5 back and walking away could come across as manipulative, especially if the girls didn't agree to return it.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author had given $5 by mistake, then it's his prerogative to fix that error. However, in charitable giving, there's an unspoken agreement that once given, it's theirs. The author's intention might have been good, but the method could be problematic. The girls might not have wanted the $5, or they might have thought they'd get $20 initially. The author's action could have left the girls in a worse position if they needed the $5 but now got nothing.\n\nAdditionally, the girls' appearance isn't a strong indicator of their need. The author assumed they weren't in dire need, but that's his judgment. The ethical question here is about the action of taking back the money after giving it. If the author realized he gave the wrong amount, he might be justified in correcting it, but the way he did it might have been considered rude or inconsiderate. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because once you give money to someone in good faith, retracting it can be seen as a breach of trust or generosity. The correct approach might have been to give the $20 instead of taking back the $5. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
