I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for taking back $5 after giving it to a kid who asked for $20. Let me go through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author was buying pizza and approached by two girls. The older one asked for money. He gave her $5, but then the girl said they wanted $20. He took back the $5 and left. His girlfriend thinks it was a bad move. The author thinks maybe not, since the kids didn't look homeless.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are: the initial donation of $5, then the girl changing the request to $20. The author took back the $5 and left. \n\nWait, when you give someone money, especially a child, if they then ask for more, does that change the situation? If the author gave the $5 thinking it was sufficient, but the girl then says they want $20, maybe there's a misunderstanding. But once the $5 is given, can the author take it back? In some places, once you give money as a donation, it's yours to give, and you can't take it back. But if there was a misunderstanding, like the child said they needed $20 but then accepted the $5, maybe the author felt misled. \n\nHowever, the author took the $5 back after giving it. That might be seen as taking advantage of the situation. If the girl was just changing her mind after accepting the money, that's one thing. But maybe the author felt tricked and wanted to correct it. But in reality, the girl might have just been trying to get more money and realized the author wasn't willing to give $20. \n\nAlso, the girls' appearance: not homeless or impoverished. That might lead some to question if they were genuinely in need. But that's making assumptions based on appearance, which isn't always reliable. \n\nThe author's action of taking back the money could be seen as dishonest or manipulative, especially if the girl expected the $5 as a donation. By taking it back, he might have broken a social contract of giving. On the other hand, if there was a misrepresentation (like the girl saying they wanted $20 but then taking $5), maybe the author felt misled and wanted to correct it. \n\nBut in the scenario, after giving the $5, the girl says they want $20. The author then takes back the $5. That could be interpreted as the author realizing he was asked for $20 but only gave $5 and correcting his mistake. However, once the $5 is given, taking it back might not be appropriate unless there was a fraudulent request. \n\nAlternatively, the author might have thought he was being scammed, but the girls didn't look homeless. Maybe they were just kids asking for money, not a scam. If the author gave the $5 in good faith and then realized he wanted to give more, but the girl was insistent on $20, he might have felt uncomfortable. But taking back the money after giving it could be seen as a dishonest move. \n\nSo, if the author took back the $5 after giving it because the girl changed her mind, that's taking back a donation he didn't have to give in the first place. That might make him at fault because once a donation is given, it's a completed transaction. Taking it back could be considered unethical. \n\nOn the other hand, if the girl misrepresented their needs (first asking for some money, then saying they want more), the author might have felt tricked. But the initial request was for any money, and the girl then asked for more. The author might have felt he was being asked for $20, but when he gave $5, she was okay with that. Then he realized he wanted to give the $20, so he took back the $5. But that's not a common social norm. People usually don't take back donations once given. \n\nSo, the author's action could be seen as wrong because he took back the money after giving it, which isn't typical. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move because it's taking back a donation, which is expected to be given freely. The author's reasoning that the girls didn't look homeless might not justify the action. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
