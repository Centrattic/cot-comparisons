I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who took back the money from the girls is in the wrong. The situation is that a man gives $5 to a girl who asks for money, but then she says they want $20. He takes back the $5 and leaves. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move, but the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girls approached him for money. He gave $5, but then they asked for $20. He took the $5 back. The man might have felt tricked or that the girls were up to something. But is it okay to take back the money?\n\nIn terms of legality, once money is given as a gift, it's hard to reclaim. But in this case, the man didn't give the $5 as a gift yet; he handed it over, then the girl changed the request. So he took back the $5. Ethically, this is a gray area. If the girls had a genuine need, taking back the money might seem callous. But if they were trying to scam him, he's protecting himself. \n\nThe description says the girls looked untidy but not homeless. So maybe it's not a clear-cut case of desperation. The man's reaction was to take back the money when he realized they wanted more. The girlfriend's disapproval suggests she thinks he should have given the $20 or at least not taken back the $5. But the man might have felt he was being misled. \n\nIt's important to consider the intent. If the girls genuinely needed money, not taking it back could be more generous. However, if they were trying to get more money under false pretenses, the man's action was a way to avoid being taken advantage of. The man's decision to take back the $5 could be seen as self-preservation. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of trust and how people in need are treated. If the man assumed they were scammers without evidence, that's a problem. The girls might have had a legitimate need but asked for $20 because they needed more, not because they were trying to trick him. In that case, taking back the $5 would be inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, if the man felt uncomfortable after their request and didn't want to give more, maybe he could have just said he couldn't give $20 and offered something else. But he chose to take back the $5, which might have been abrupt and hurtful.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the man's action was a reasonable response to a potential scam or an inconsiderate act towards someone in need. Given the information, it's ambiguous, but the man might be in the wrong for not handling the situation more gracefully. Alternatively, he might be justified in protecting himself. However, the key point is that taking back the money after giving it might be seen as a poor choice, especially if the girls genuinely needed it. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he could have handled it differently without taking back the $5.\n"
