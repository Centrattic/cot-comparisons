I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is they gave a girl $5, and then when the girl asked for $20 instead, they took the $5 back and walked away. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move, but the author is unsure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was giving money to a child, which can be tricky. When you give money to someone, especially a child, it's usually with the understanding that it's a donation or a gift. If the child then asks for more, does the giver have the right to take back the initial amount? Legally, once money is given, it's theirs. But in this case, the author took it back after the child requested more. That's where the moral dilemma comes in.\n\nThe girls were described as not being in dire straits. They were clean but untidy, no shoes. That might suggest they aren't homeless or in extreme poverty. So maybe the author thought they were being asked for more than they needed. But is it right to retract a gift? If the author gave $5 and then took it back because the child asked for $20, is that considered a betrayal of trust? Or is the author within their rights to change their mind?\n\nAnother angle: When you give someone money, you can't take it back unless they owe you something. So maybe the author is wrong to take back the $5. But the author's reasoning was that the initial offer was $5, and when the child asked for $20, they felt they should adjust. But the child might not have realized they were supposed to take the $5. Maybe the author should have just said no to the $20 without taking the $5 back. That way, the initial donation stands, and they can refuse the higher amount politely. \n\nAlso, the age of the children is a factor. A 12-year-old might not fully understand the implications of asking for money. The author might have thought they were being manipulated into giving more. But again, taking back the money after giving it could be seen as dishonest. \n\nIn some cultures, retracting a gift is considered rude or unethical. So the author's action might be viewed as a breach of trust. The girlfriend's reaction as a \"dick move\" suggests that others might see it that way. \n\nBut then again, the author was in a situation where they felt the initial donation was insufficient, so they tried to correct their mistake. However, the mistake was giving $5 when they intended to give $20. If they didn't want to give $5, they shouldn't have given it. But if they did give it, taking it back is problematic. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because once the $5 was given, they can't take it back. They should have either given $20 from the start or not given anything. Taking back the money after the fact is a bit of a bait-and-switch and could be seen as dishonest or disrespectful to the child.\n"
