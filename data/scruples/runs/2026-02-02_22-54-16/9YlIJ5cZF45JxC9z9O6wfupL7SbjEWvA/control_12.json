I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person gave $5 to a 12-year-old girl who later asked for $20. Then they took back the $5 and left with the $20. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the initial giving of $5 was a charitable act. But when the girl changed her mind and asked for more, the author decided to take back the $5. The key issue here is whether the author had the right to take back the money after giving it. \n\nIn most cases, once you give someone money, it's theirs unless there was a misunderstanding or a condition attached. The author didn't mention any conditions when giving the $5. The girl then asked for $20, so maybe the author felt misled, but taking the money back might not be the right approach. \n\nAlso, the girls' appearance is mentioned as not being in dire straits, which might lead some to question the validity of their request. However, the author's action of taking the money back could be seen as deceptive because they gave the $5 initially and then took it back without explaining. \n\nThe girlfriend thinks it was a dick move because the author might have tricked the girls. The author's action could be viewed as exploiting the situation by giving money and then retracting it. \n\nLegally, once the money is given, it's transferred. Retaking it could be considered theft or fraud if there wasn't a prior agreement. Ethically, it's about trust and honesty. The author might have thought they were being clever, but it could come off as underhanded. \n\nSo considering both legal and ethical perspectives, the author probably did something wrong by taking back the money after giving it without any prior conditions. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
