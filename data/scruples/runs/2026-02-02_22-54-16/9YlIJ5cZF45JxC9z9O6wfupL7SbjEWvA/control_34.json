I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about giving money to two girls and then taking it back.\n\nFirst, the author gives $5 to a girl who then asks for $20. He takes back the $5 and leaves. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nHmm, when someone asks for money, giving it is a voluntary act. The girls approached him, so he had the choice to give any amount. He gave $5, but they wanted more. Then he took back the $5. Legally, he might be in the right because once he gave the money, he can't force it to stay. But morally, maybe? He could have just said no to the $20. Instead, he took it back and walked away. That might seem abrupt. \n\nBut the girls didn't look homeless, so maybe they were testing him or trying to manipulate. The author might be questioning his own judgment here. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that taking back the money was rude. However, the author had the right to change his mind. \n\nWait, but once he gave the $5, taking it back might be seen as rude. Perhaps he should have just declined to give more instead of taking it back. Maybe he's overstepping by physically taking the money back. \n\nOn the other hand, if the girls were just trying to get as much as possible, the author's action could be a way to not be taken advantage of. But how to handle that? Maybe a better approach would be to give a firm no instead of taking back the money. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might not be in the wrong legally, but morally, taking back the money could be seen as rude. The answer might be A (wrong) because he should have handled it more politely instead of taking back the money. Alternatively, B (not wrong) because he had the right to change his mind. \n\nI think the key point is that he took the money back after giving it. Normally, once given, you can't take it back unless they offer to return it. If he gave it and then wanted to retract, that's not customary. So taking it back might be seen as inconsiderate. Hence, A.\n"
