I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for taking back $5 after giving it to a girl who then asked for $20. Hmm.\n\nFirst, he gave $5 to the girl, thinking she needed some money. Then she said they wanted $20, so he took back the $5 and gave $20 instead. Wait, no, actually, the description says he gave $5, then she asked for $20. He then said he would take back the $5 and give a $20. So he took the $5 back and gave a $20 bill. So he ended up giving $15 total? Or was it replacing the $5 with $20? \n\nThe girlfriend says it was a dick move. The main question is whether it was wrong to take back the $5 after giving it. Legally, once you give money, it's theirs. But if there was a misunderstanding, maybe he could take it back. But the girl didn't give it back. Wait, the user says he took the $5 back and gave a $20. So he took back the $5 and gave a $20 in its place. So he gave $15 more in total. But the problem is, did the girl have the right to demand more money after receiving the $5? \n\nIt's a bit of a tricky situation. If he gave $5, and then she said they wanted $20, maybe she was trying to get more. But he thought he was helping, then realized he should give more. But in doing so, he took back the $5. So, did he have the right to take it back? If the transaction wasn't completed yet, maybe he could. But once the money is given, it's usually considered a gift. However, if there's an agreement for a service or something, maybe not. \n\nThe girl's sister was around 6, so maybe they were asking for money for something specific. The user might have felt embarrassed about giving too little, so tried to correct it. But taking back the $5 might have been perceived as rude or a manipulation. The girlfriend thinks it was a dick move because he took back the money after giving it. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, morally, maybe he should have just given the $20 in the first place instead of taking back the $5. But legally, if there's no contract, he can take back the money if the other party hasn't fulfilled any obligation. However, since he gave the $5 first, then took it back, maybe it's seen as dishonest. \n\nThe girl didn't give him anything for the $5, so he could argue that he had the right to take it back. But the act of taking it back might be seen as a lack of trust or a condescending move, especially towards children. So, the answer might depend on the perspective. The user's action might be seen as wrong because once you give money, it's theirs, and taking it back could be seen as a betrayal of trust. But if the user realized he gave too little and wanted to correct it, maybe it's understandable. \n\nBut since the girl was asking for more, he could have just given the $20 from the start. Taking back the $5 might have been unnecessary and caused more harm. The answer could be A (yes, he's in the wrong) because he took back the money after giving it, which could be seen as a violation of trust, even if he intended to give more. Alternatively, B (no) if he didn't have any obligation to give the money and could change his mind. \n\nConsidering the context, the user's action might be seen as wrong because once the money is given, it's a gift and can't be taken back. So taking it back was a bad move. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
