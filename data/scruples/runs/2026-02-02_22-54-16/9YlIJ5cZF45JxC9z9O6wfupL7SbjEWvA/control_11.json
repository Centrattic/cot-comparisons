I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about giving money to two girls who asked for it.\n\nThe author initially gave $5 but the older girl asked for $20 instead. The author then took back the $5 and walked away. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move, but the author isn't sure.\n\nSo, the key points here. First, the author gave $5, which the girl then said they wanted $20. The author didn't have $20, so they took back the $5 and left. The girls didn't seem homeless or in dire need, just maybe not well-dressed but clean.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. When giving money to someone, especially a child, there's an expectation that the giver is providing a charitable act. But when the recipient then demands more, that changes the situation. The author didn't have $20, so they couldn't fulfill the request. Taking back the $5 was a way to retract the initial donation when the terms changed.\n\nBut is that fair? If the author gave the $5 as a donation, the girl's request for more might be seen as taking advantage. However, once the $5 was given, the author might have felt misled. But once money is given, it's generally considered a gift unless there was a specific agreement. So taking it back could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the girl was in need.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have felt pressured by the girl's sudden demand for a higher amount. The author's actions could be seen as a way to avoid being taken advantage of. However, the act of taking the money back after giving it might come off as rude or untrustworthy.\n\nAlso, considering the context: the girls were not in dire straits. Maybe the author could have said no to the $20 without taking back the $5. That way, they could have kept their initial donation without engaging in the back-and-forth.\n\nSo, the author's mistake might be in taking back the money instead of just declining the $20 request. Taking back the $5 could be seen as a breach of trust or stinginess after having already given. Alternatively, the author might have felt justified in retracting the donation when the request changed.\n\nBut in terms of social norms, once you give money, it's usually not expected to take it back. Even if the recipient asks for more, the giver can choose to say no without needing to retrieve the initial amount. So the act of taking back the money might be the issue here.\n\nTherefore, the author could be in the wrong for taking back the money, making the answer A.\n"
