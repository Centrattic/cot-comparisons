I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves giving money to two girls, first $5, then taking it back when they ask for $20.\n\nFirst, the author gives $5 to the girls. The older girl then says they want $20. The author then takes back the $5 and walks away. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move, but the author is unsure.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: Did the author have an obligation to give $20 after initially giving $5? The initial transaction was a donation of $5. When the girls asked for more, the author decided to retract the $5. \n\nI need to consider if the author had a commitment to give $20 once the $5 was given. Since the $5 was given first, and then the request for $20 came after, the author might not be obligated to fulfill that. However, taking back the $5 after handing it over could be seen as deceptive or taking advantage of the situation. \n\nThe girls were described as not being in dire poverty, so maybe the author thought they were being taken advantage of. But the act of taking back the money after giving it could be considered rude or a breach of trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had the right to change their mind, especially if they felt the initial amount was a mistake. But the way it was done\u2014taking back the money after handing it over\u2014might be seen as inconsiderate or dishonest. \n\nSo, there's a balance here between personal choice and social expectations. The author might be in the wrong for retracting the money after giving it, even if they felt it was a mistake. The action could be perceived as baiting the girls to ask for more, then taking back the money. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because taking back the money after giving it could be seen as dishonest or manipulative, even if the initial intent was to donate.\n"
