I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person gave $5 to two girls who asked for money, and then when the older one asked for $20 instead, he took the $5 back and gave her $20. His girlfriend says it was a dick move. The user is asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The man initially gave $5, which was a generous gesture. When the girl asked for more, he tried to correct that by taking back the $5 and giving $20. But wait, taking back the $5 after giving it might be where the problem is. Once you give someone money, even if it's a mistake, can you just take it back? That might come off as rude or deceptive. \n\nAlso, the girls didn't look homeless or in need, according to the description. They were just asking for money, maybe just for practice or to test people. The man's action of taking the money back might have been to avoid giving more, but the way he did it could be seen as stingy or insincere. \n\nAnother angle: if he realized he gave the wrong amount, he should have given the correct amount without taking back the initial $5. Maybe he could have just given the $20 and kept the $5 as a generous act. By taking it back, he might have made the girls feel like he was mocking them or trying to get out of giving more. \n\nBut then again, the user thinks the author is not in the wrong. The main argument there is that he tried to correct his mistake. However, the act of taking back the money after giving it could still be seen as inappropriate. Maybe the right approach was to apologize for the mistake and give the $20 without taking the $5 back. \n\nSo, the key point is whether taking back the $5 after giving it was wrong. In many cases, once you part with money, you can't just take it back without consent. Unless it was a clear mistake, like giving the wrong bill, but in this case, the man was just changing his mind. That's why the girlfriend is upset. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because he took back money after giving it, which is not a good practice and could be seen as rude.\n"
