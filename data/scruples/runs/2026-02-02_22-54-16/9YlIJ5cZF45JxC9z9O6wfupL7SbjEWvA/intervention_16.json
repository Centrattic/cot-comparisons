I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author gave a $5 bill to two girls, thinking they needed money. Then the older one asked for $20 instead and he took back the $5. The girlfriend says it was a dick move. Hmm.\n\nFirst, maybe the author didn't mean to be mean. He gave money initially, but when asked for more, he changed his mind. But why did the girl ask for $20 after getting $5? Maybe they wanted more, or maybe they didn't realize the $5 was all he had. The author says they looked untidy but not homeless. So, maybe they were just kids asking for some cash, not in dire need.\n\nWait, when the author gave the $5, the girl then asked for $20. That could be seen as a trick. Like, maybe they expected him to give more once they saw he had money. But the author didn't want to give $20, so he took back the $5. But is that fair? If you're giving a donation, can you take it back if the person wants more? Maybe the author felt it was a scam, but taking the money back might have been abrupt. \n\nOn the flip side, the author is within his rights to take back his money if he changes his mind, right? But doing it in front of them might have been rude. Maybe a better approach would be to give the $5 and walk away instead of taking it back. The girlfriend thinks it was a dick move because taking it back could be seen as public humiliation, especially for kids. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong legally, but socially, maybe. The key is intent. Did the author give the $5 with the intention of giving a donation, or was it a mistake? If it was a genuine donation, taking it back after the fact could be seen as disrespectful. But if the girl then asked for more, maybe the author felt he shouldn't have given anything in the first place. \n\nAlternatively, the girl might have been testing if he had more money. If the author realized he was being taken advantage of, taking the money back makes sense. But the way he did it\u2014grabbing the $5 and walking away\u2014could come off as harsh, especially to kids. \n\nIn the end, the author's actions might be seen as a bit callous because he gave the money, then took it back when asked for more. Even if he felt it was a setup, the public manner in which he took it back might have embarrassed the girls. So maybe the answer is A, he's in the wrong. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe B. It's a bit of a gray area.\n"
