I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole\" situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about giving $5 to two kids who asked for money, then when the older one asks for $20 instead, the author takes back the $5 and walks away.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author gave $5 initially, but when the child asked for $20, they took the $5 back and left. The girlfriend says it was rude, but the author is unsure. The kids weren't homeless but just looked untidy (no shoes but clean). The user thinks the author isn't wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did something wrong. Let me break it down. Giving money to someone in need is a kind gesture, but the author changed their mind when the request was increased. The initial $5 was given, but then the child asked for more. The author's response was to take the $5 back and leave. \n\nBut wait, once the $5 was given, could they take it back? If someone gives money as a donation, can they retract it if the recipient changes their mind? In some places, once a gift is given, it's considered a done deal. However, in this case, the author might not have intended to give $20 and realized they were being asked more than they were willing to give. The author's action was to take back the $5 and offer $20, but the kids didn't return the $5. So the author took it back to avoid giving $20. \n\nThe problem here is whether it's ethical to take back money once it's been given. The author might have felt pressured after the initial gift, but retracting the money could be seen as stingy or dishonest. On the other hand, the author might not have been in a position to give $20 and decided to correct their mistake. \n\nThe kids' behavior: the older one asked for $20 after receiving $5. Maybe they were testing the author's generosity. The author tried to back out of the initial gift to meet the new request, but that could come off as being inconsiderate. The key is the author's reaction. Taking back the $5 might have been seen as a betrayal if the child expected the $5 to be a final gift. \n\nAlso, the author mentions the kids weren't in dire need but just looked untidy. So maybe the author felt they weren't in a real hardship, which adds to the justification. However, the act of taking back money after giving it could still be seen as rude or deceptive. The author's action might have been impulsive, and the girlfriend's reaction suggests that others might view it as inconsiderate. \n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a principle of honesty and follow-through. If someone gives money, retracting it could be seen as breaking trust. However, if the initial act was a mistake (like giving $5 by mistake when intending to give $20), then it might be reasonable to correct it. But in this case, the author gave $5, then realized the child wanted more. Perhaps the author felt they had to adjust their offer, but taking back the money was a poor way to handle it. \n\nAnother angle: the author could have said, \"I can give $5,\" and not taken it back when the child asked for $20. Taking it back might have made the situation awkward for the kids. The author might have felt they were being taken advantage of, but handling it by retracting the money could be seen as a dick move. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer depends on context. If the author genuinely made a mistake in the amount, they might not be at fault. But if they gave the money and then tried to take it back because the child wanted more, that's where the issue lies. The key is whether the author's action was honest and respectful. Taking back the money after giving it might be the problem, regardless of the initial intent.\n"
