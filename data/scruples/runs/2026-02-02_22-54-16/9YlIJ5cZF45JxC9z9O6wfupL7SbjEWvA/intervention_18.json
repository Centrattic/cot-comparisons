I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking back the $5 after the girl initially asked for $5 but then changed to $20. The author gave the $5, then the girl asked for $20 instead. The author took back the $5 and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was approached by two girls, gave $5, then the older one said they wanted $20. The author then took back the $5 and left. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move, but the author isn't sure.\n\nThe key points here are intent and deception. Did the girl deceive the author? If the girl had no intention of taking the $5 and was just trying to get more money, that's different from if she genuinely needed $5 and then realized she needed $20. However, the author mentions the girls looked untidy but not homeless. Maybe the author suspected they weren't in real need.\n\nIn terms of ethics, giving money is a voluntary act. If the person receiving the money then changes their request, the giver isn't obligated to give more. The author took back the $5 because they were going to give $20, but when the request changed, they took back the $5. This could be seen as the author being cautious or not wanting to give more than intended. Alternatively, the girl might feel cheated because the author didn't follow through after giving the $5.\n\nBut legally, there's no contract here. The author could change their mind. Ethically, it's more nuanced. If the girl was in genuine need, taking back the $5 could seem stingy. However, if the author felt misled, then it's understandable. The author says the girls \"definitely not impoverished or homeless,\" so maybe the author didn't believe they needed the money. In that case, the author's action isn't wrong because they were being cautious and not falling into a potential scam.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
