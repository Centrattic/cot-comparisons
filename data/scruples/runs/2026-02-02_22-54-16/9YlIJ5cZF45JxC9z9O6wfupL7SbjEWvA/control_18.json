I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about giving money to two girls who asked for it. Initially, the person gives them $5, but when the older girl says they wanted $20, the author takes back the $5 and walks away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author gave $5 out of kindness, but when the request was upped to $20, they took the money back. The main point of contention is whether this action is wrong. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move, but the author is unsure. \n\nThe girls looked untidy but not homeless or impoverished. That detail might matter because it could influence perceptions of their need. If they weren't in dire straits, maybe the author is being cautious. But the author gave money initially, which suggests they thought the girls had a legitimate need. Then, when the amount was increased, the author took back the $5. \n\nI should think about the context of giving money to strangers. People often give out of goodwill, but sometimes that can be exploited. However, the author didn't ask for anything in return. The older girl changed the request after receiving the initial amount. The author's response was to take back the $5, which could be seen as stingy or as not wanting to be taken advantage of. \n\nThere's also the aspect of trust. Once the money is given, taking it back might break that trust. The younger sister might not know what's happening, and the older one is pressuring for more. The author might be right to not give more because they could be being scammed, but taking back the initial amount they already gave might be the problem. \n\nAnother angle is that the author had the intention to help but then changed their mind when the request was higher. The act of taking the money back could be seen as a betrayal of the initial goodwill. On the other hand, if the girls were trying to get more than what was offered, maybe the author was protecting themselves from being taken advantage of. \n\nI should also consider cultural norms. In some places, people might expect that once you give money, you can't take it back. But in others, especially if there's a suspicion of a scam, people might be more cautious. The key here is that the author didn't give the $20, but took back the $5. \n\nSo, the question is: is the author wrong for taking back the money? If the girls genuinely needed help, taking back the $5 could be seen as not following through. But if the author felt they were being asked for more than they intended, then it's a matter of personal boundaries. \n\nThe user might be looking for a balanced view. The answer depends on whether the author's action was a reasonable way to set boundaries versus being dishonest. Since the author didn't lie initially and then corrected their mistake, maybe it's not wrong. But some might argue that once given, taking back is unkind. \n\nIn the end, I think it's a judgment call, but the author's actions can be seen as not wrong because they were correcting their own mistake when the request changed. However, there's a counterargument about trust and the initial act of giving. But given the details, the answer is probably B (No) because the author adjusted their donation and didn't give more, which is their right. The problem might be that the author didn't keep the $5 after being asked to give more, but in this case, they took it back. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
