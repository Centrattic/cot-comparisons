I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about giving money to two kids who asked for it.\n\nFirst, the person initially gives $5, then the girl asks for $20 instead. The author takes back the $5 and walks away. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move, but the author isn't sure. The kids looked untidy but not homeless or impoverished.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the initial act of giving money, the change in request, and the author's reaction. When someone asks for money, the giver can choose how much to give. The author gave $5, which was a charitable act. Then the girl asks for more, which might be unexpected. The author's response is to take back the $5 and offer $20 instead. But he doesn't have $20 to give and walks away.\n\nWait, no, actually, he takes back the $5 and says he'll get $20. But he doesn't actually give the $20. He just takes the $5 back. So he's going back on his initial donation. Was he obligated to give more once he gave $5? Probably not. The problem is, when you give money, you can't take it back. If the kids asked for $20 first, the author might not have given anything. But since he gave $5, the girl then ups the request. The author's action of taking back the $5 could be seen as stingy or not following through. \n\nBut the author might have felt pressured. The question is whether taking back the money was wrong. The girls weren't in dire straits, so maybe the author was right to not give more. However, once he gave the $5, retracting it might be seen as rude or breaking trust. The author's intention was to help, but the follow-up action might have been inconsiderate. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't obligated to give more. The initial $5 was a choice. If the girl wanted more, the author could decline. But taking back the $5 after giving it might be seen as a step back from the initial generosity. \n\nSo, the girlfriend's perspective is that it's a dick move because he took back the money. But the author's reasoning is that the kids wanted more, so he tried to adjust. However, the author didn't actually have $20 to give, so the offer was insincere. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for deciding to take back the money. He had the right to change his mind. However, the way he did it might have been abrupt. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. So, answer B (No) because the author isn't obligated to give more than he intended. The initial donation was his choice, and he can retract if he feels the request is unreasonable. The kids weren't in a desperate situation, so the author's action is defensible. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
