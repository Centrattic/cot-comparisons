I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves giving a kid $5, then when the kid asks for $20 instead, taking back the $5. The author's girlfriend thinks it's a dick move, but the author isn't sure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person gave $5 to a girl who asked for money, thinking it was a small gesture. Then the girl or her sister wanted $20 instead. The author took back the $5 to give the higher amount. However, the user mentions the girls looked untidy but not homeless or impoverished.\n\nThe key points here are intent and deception. Did the girl have any right to expect $20 after being given $5? If the initial request was for money, and the donor decided to give $5, then changing the request after the fact might be an issue. Also, if the girls were not in genuine need, maybe the author could have refused the initial request.\n\nTaking back the $5 could be seen as a way to honor a higher commitment, but if there was no prior agreement for $20, the author might be just correcting an overcommitment. However, the act of taking back the money might come across as manipulative or dishonest, especially if the girls were expecting the $5 as a gift and then had it taken away.\n\nAnother angle is the author's assumption about the girls' situation. If they weren't in dire need, the author might have been under no obligation to give money in the first place. But once given, taking it back could be seen as withholding, especially if the girls were honest about their need.\n\nEthically, it's about honesty and the intent behind the action. If the author realized they could give more, taking back the initial amount to give a larger sum might be considered generous, but the method of doing so could be questionable. Alternatively, if the author felt pressured or lied about their initial intent, that's different.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people might view the act of taking back a gift as inconsiderate, regardless of the reason. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that taking back the money after giving it might be seen as disrespectful.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they gave money with the intention of helping, then took it back to give more, which could be seen as insincere or manipulative, especially if there was no prior agreement. The girls' need wasn't confirmed, but the act of retracting a gift after giving it might be socially frowned upon, regardless of their actual need.\n"
