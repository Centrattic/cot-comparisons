I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about giving money to kids who asked for it, but then taking it back when they asked for more.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author gives $5 to a 12-year-old girl, but then the girl asks for $20 instead. The author takes back the $5 and gives nothing. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move, but the author isn't sure. The kids looked untidy but not homeless or impoverished.\n\nHmm. So the main question is whether taking back the money was wrong. Let's consider the intentions here. The author initially gave $5 in good faith, assuming it was a donation. When the girl changed her mind and asked for more, the author tried to reverse the transaction. Is that fair?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, once the money is given, it's a completed transaction. Taking it back might be seen as deceptive, especially if the recipient expected to keep it. However, the author might argue that the request was a mistake, and they didn't want to give more. But if the girl was just asking for a higher amount, the author could have said no and kept the $5. Instead, taking back the $5 could be perceived as dishonest because the author made the recipient return the money after it was already given. \n\nAlso, the kids' appearance: they weren't homeless, so maybe they were just asking for money for something trivial. The author might have felt they were being taken advantage of. But still, giving money to a child is a personal choice, and if the child changes the amount, the author could have just refused to give more without taking back the initial $5. \n\nThe girlfriend's opinion is that it's a dick move, which suggests that the action is seen as rude or inconsiderate. The author might be overthinking, but the act of taking back the money could be seen as a breach of trust or generosity. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might be in the wrong because once the money is given, retracting it after the fact could be seen as unethical. The better approach would have been to either give $20 if they wanted it or keep the $5 if they didn't. Taking it back after the donation is made could be seen as a selfish move, especially if the child had already accepted it. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
