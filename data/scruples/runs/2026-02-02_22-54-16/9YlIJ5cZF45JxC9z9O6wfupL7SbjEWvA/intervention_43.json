I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the person is asking if they were in the wrong when they took back the $5 they gave to two girls. Let me re-read the situation to make sure I get all the details right.\n\nThe author was buying pizza, got the order, and on the way back to their car, a 12-year-old and her younger sister (around 6) approached them asking for money. The author gave them $5, but then the older girl said they wanted $20. The author asked for the $5 back to give a $20 bill instead. Then the author took the $5 and walked away. The girlfriend says it was a dick move, but the author isn't sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but clean), not obviously homeless or impoverished.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author initially gave $5, which was a donation. Then the older girl asked for $20. The author then tried to correct their mistake by asking for the $5 back to give $20, but walked away after the girl didn't return the $5. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nLet me break it down. When the author first gave the $5, that was a generous act. But when the girl asked for $20, maybe the author thought they made a mistake in the amount. However, once the $5 was given, it's no longer the author's money. The author can't just take it back unless the girl is willing to return it. By taking the $5 back, the author is essentially reclaiming their money, which could be seen as a way to correct their mistake. But the problem arises in how they did it. The girl might have felt pressured or confused. Also, the author didn't offer to give $20 instead; they took the $5 back without a clear agreement. \n\nAnother angle: giving money to children might not be the best idea. Maybe the girls were just asking for money for a specific reason, and the author's initial intent was to help by giving $5. When the girl asked for $20, the author might have thought they should give more, but once the money is given, you can't retract it. The author's action of taking the $5 back might have been abrupt and could be seen as a betrayal of trust. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction says it was a dick move, which suggests that taking the money back after giving it might be perceived as inconsiderate. The girls might have already spent the $5 or were expecting more. The author's action could be seen as taking advantage of the situation, even if unintentionally. \n\nAlso, the context of the girls' appearance: not homeless but untidy. Maybe they were in a situation where they needed money for something else, but the author's initial assumption might not be accurate. Taking back the money after the initial donation might have made the situation awkward or worse for the girls.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author genuinely thought they should give $20, but had only given $5 by mistake, they might have tried to correct that. But the proper way would be to give another $15, not take back the $5. Taking back the $5 without the girl's consent could be seen as wrong because it's a breach of trust. The author's intention might be good, but the action is inappropriate.\n\nIn summary, the author might have acted without considering the girls' perspective. Giving money to children can be tricky because they might not be in a position to handle such a situation, and taking money back after giving it can be seen as dishonest or inconsiderate. The author's action, even if with good intentions, might be ethically questionable because it's about taking back money once given, which isn't possible unless the recipient is willing to return it. So, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
