I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person gave $5 to two girls who asked for money. The older girl then said they wanted $20, so the author took back the $5 and walked away. The girlfriend thinks it was a dick move, but the author isn't sure.\n\nFirst, the initial act of giving $5 is a kind gesture. The problem arises when the older girl changes the amount they're asking for. The author, upon realizing the increase from $5 to $20, decided to retract the $5. Now, the question is whether that's wrong.\n\nI need to consider intent. The author might have thought they were helping, but when the request changed, they felt it was better to take back the money. The key points here are: Did the author have a right to take back the money once it was given? Well, once the $5 was given and then returned, there's no issue. The author gave, then took back, which is their right. The girls didn't have a legal claim to the money, so the author isn't obligated to keep giving. \n\nAlso, the girls' appearance isn't impoverished, which might make the author question the legitimacy of the request. But even if they were, the author isn't required to give money. The situation is about the author's right to change their mind after the initial donation. Since the money was returned, there's no harm done. The author isn't in the wrong because they can choose to retract a donation if they change their mind, especially if the circumstances change (like the amount requested increasing). So the answer should be B.\n"
