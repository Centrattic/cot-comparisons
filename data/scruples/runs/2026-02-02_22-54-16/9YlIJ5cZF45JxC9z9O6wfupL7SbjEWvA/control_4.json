I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves giving $5 to two girls who asked for money, then the older girl says they want $20 and the author takes back the $5. The girlfriend thinks it was a dick move. The question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author gives $5 initially, then when asked for $20, takes back the $5. The key points here are the intentions and the actions.\n\nThe author's perspective is that they were generous by giving $5, but when the older girl increased the amount, they decided not to give more. The argument against the author is that they were dishonest by not giving $20 after taking back the $5. The defense is that the author wasn't obligated to give more and that the girls might not have been in genuine need.\n\nI should consider the ethical aspects. Did the author have an obligation to give $20 after giving $5? Probably not. However, the act of taking back the $5 might be seen as deceptive because the initial offer was made in good faith, and then withdrawn upon a higher request. That could be perceived as not being honest or respectful of the initial gift.\n\nAlso, the girls' appearance is mentioned as not being homeless or impoverished. This could imply that the author suspects the girls might have been scamming or asking for more than they needed. However, the author should consider that even if the girls were in a questionable situation, the act of taking back the money after giving it could be seen as a breach of trust or empathy.\n\nAnother angle is the intention behind the request for $20. Did the older girl genuinely need more, or was it a tactic to get more money? The author might have felt they were being asked for more than they were comfortable giving, which is their right. But the way they took back the $5 might have been abrupt and could be seen as stingy or rude.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is not legally wrong, but socially or morally, it's debatable. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that she thinks the author was inconsiderate. The key here is whether the author's action was respectful and compassionate. By taking back the money, the author might have humiliated the girls or made them feel like they were being taken advantage of.\n\nSo, the author's action might be seen as wrong because they didn't handle the situation with more empathy. If the girls were genuinely in need, taking back the money after giving it could be hurtful. Even if the author suspected the girls weren't in dire need, the way they withdrew the money could be considered unkind. The author could have simply declined the $20 request without taking back the $5.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they went back on their initial generous act in a way that could be seen as disrespectful and dishonest.\n"
