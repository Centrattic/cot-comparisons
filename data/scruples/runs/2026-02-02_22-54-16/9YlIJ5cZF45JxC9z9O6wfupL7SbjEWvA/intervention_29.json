I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking back the money after giving $5 to two girls who asked for $20. The situation is a bit tricky.\n\nFirst, the author gave $5, and the girl then asked for $20. So, the initial action was generous, giving $5. But then the girl wanted more. The author took back the $5 and gave $20 instead, but then walked away. The girlfriend thinks it was a dick move. The key points here are the interaction and the perception of the situation.\n\nThe author probably thought that the girl was trying to get more money by pretending they needed $20. But why would a 12-year-old and her sister not have any money? Maybe they were just asking for help, but the way they presented it might have led the author to think they were trying to scam. However, the children looked untidy but not homeless, so maybe they were just in need but not in a dire situation.\n\nThe author's actions: giving $5, then taking it back to give $20. But instead, they took the $5 back and walked off. So, the author didn't give $20; they just took back the $5. That might be seen as dishonest because they told the girl to give back the $5 to get $20, but then didn't follow through. That could be deceitful. Alternatively, maybe the author realized they were being taken advantage of or thought the girls were lying about needing $20.\n\nBut there's another angle. If the author genuinely thought they were being scammed, then it's understandable. However, the author's description says the kids were \"untidy but still clean,\" not in poverty. So maybe the author overreacted. The main issue is whether the author's action of taking back the money was justified.\n\nI think the author might be in the wrong because once they gave the $5, taking it back could be seen as breaking a trust. Even if the girl asked for more, the author could have given $20 if they were willing to help more. Instead, by taking back the $5 and walking away, it might have been perceived as mocking or tricking the kids. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that it wasn't seen as a good move. So, the answer might be A (Yes), but I need to make sure. Alternatively, if the author felt they were being scammed, maybe B (No). But the situation is ambiguous. Given that the kids were not in obvious distress, it's possible the author overstepped. So, leaning towards A.\n"
