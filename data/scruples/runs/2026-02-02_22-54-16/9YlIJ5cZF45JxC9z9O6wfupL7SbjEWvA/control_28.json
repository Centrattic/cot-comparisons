I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person gave $5 to a girl who asked for money, then when the girl said they wanted $20 instead, he took the $5 back and walked away. His girlfriend called it a dick move. The question is whether he was wrong.\n\nFirst, when someone asks for money, and you give them an amount, they might not clarify if they want more. But here, the girl changed her mind after receiving the $5. The person tried to be accommodating by offering to get a $20 instead. But then he took the $5 back and left. \n\nHmm, so if you give someone $5, and they say they actually want $20, do you have an obligation to give more? Not really. The initial offer was $5, and they changed their request. The person could have said they can't give more, which is their right. \n\nBut maybe the problem is that he took the $5 back after giving it. Once you give money, you can't take it back. If the girl wanted more, he could have said, \"I can't give more,\" instead of retracting the $5. That might seem rude. So by taking back the $5, he might have insulted her, showing he didn't want to give at all. \n\nThe context also mentions they weren't homeless or impoverished, which might imply they weren't genuinely in need. But the person didn't know that. The key issue is whether taking back the money after giving it was wrong. Generally, once you hand over money, it's theirs. Retracting it could be seen as inconsiderate. So maybe the author is in the wrong because he went back on his gesture, which might have been rude. So answer A.\n"
