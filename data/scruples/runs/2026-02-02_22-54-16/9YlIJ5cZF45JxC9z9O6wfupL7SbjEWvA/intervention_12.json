I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about someone giving money to two girls, then taking it back when they ask for more. The user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial act of giving $5. The author saw a girl and her sister asking for money. They handed over $5, which is a kind gesture. The key moment comes when the older girl says they wanted $20 instead. The author then takes back the $5 and says they'll give $20. But when they actually take the money back, they don't give the $20. That's the point of contention.\n\nThe user's girlfriend says it's a dick move. Why? Maybe because the author didn't actually give $20. They might have felt like they were being manipulated or that the initial $5 was taken advantage of. The girls might have realized they could get more, so they asked for it. But the author didn't follow through, which could be seen as unfair.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they were being pressured into giving more than they wanted. They might feel that once they realized the amount wasn't suitable, they had the right to renege. But is that acceptable? If someone gives money with the understanding of a certain amount, then takes it back under pressure, that might not be the best approach. \n\nAlso, the description says the girls weren't homeless or impoverished. Maybe the author felt it was a scam or that the girls weren't in real need. But asking for more money after receiving some could be seen as trying to get more, which is a bit of a tricky situation.\n\nThe author's action might be seen as deceptive because they said they would give $20 but didn't. That could feel like a betrayal of trust. People might expect that if you offer money and then take it back, you would give a larger amount. Not doing so could be considered dishonest, even if the initial intent was just to give $5.\n\nAlternatively, the author might have regretted the initial amount and wanted to correct it. But the way they handled it\u2014taking back the $5 without giving $20\u2014is problematic. It's a bit of a bait-and-switch. That's where the girlfriend's criticism comes from.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't follow through on the promise to give $20, which could be seen as dishonest. Even if the initial $5 was a mistake, taking it back without giving the promised amount is misleading. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
