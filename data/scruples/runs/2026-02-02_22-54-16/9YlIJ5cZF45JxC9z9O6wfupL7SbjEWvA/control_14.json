I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who took back the money is in the wrong. The situation is that he gave a girl $5, then when asked for $20, took back the $5 and left. His girlfriend says it was a dick move.\n\nFirst, the key points: He initially gave $5, which he could afford. The girl asked for $20 instead. He took back the $5 and walked away. The girls weren't in obvious distress, not homeless, just maybe not dressed nicely.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, charity is usually voluntary. He wasn't obligated to give money in the first place. By giving $5, he was being generous. When the girl asked for more, he had the right to retract his initial offer. It's his choice whether to give more. The problem might be in the way he took back the $5. If he gave it out of goodwill and then took it back, that could be seen as insincere or stingy. But he wasn't lying; he just changed his mind. \n\nHowever, if the girl expected the $5 as a gift, taking it back might be rude. But since he offered it and then realized he wanted to give more, he tried to take back the $5 to give $20. But when he changed his mind, he took the $5 back. The issue might be that he gave with the intention of helping, then reversed it. \n\nThe girls' appearance isn't a factor in whether he's in the wrong. They might have needed the money or not, but the act itself is about his choice. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, taking back a gift after giving it could be seen as a mistake. People might expect that once given, it's theirs. But from a legal standpoint, he's within his rights to take back money he gave if it was a mistake. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether retracting the money was respectful. If he gave $5 and then said he'll give $20, but then walked away without giving the $20, that's a problem. But according to the story, he took back the $5 and left. So he didn't give the $20. That might be seen as not following through on his promise. Wait, in the scenario, he says he took back the $5 and walked away. So he didn't give the $20. So he initially gave $5, then took it back and left. That could be seen as taking back a gift, which is not nice. But he wasn't forced to give money. \n\nAlternatively, if he gave $5 as a donation, then taking it back might be considered rude or deceptive. Because people might think the donation is final. So in that case, he's in the wrong. But if it was a mistake in the amount, he can correct it. \n\nThe key is whether the act of giving and then taking back is considered wrong. Since he gave $5, then took it back, maybe he was being impulsive. The girl might have expected the $5 as help, and taking it back could be seen as not being generous. \n\nSo the answer could be A (in the wrong) because he gave and then took back, which is not respectful. However, he wasn't obligated to give in the first place. But once given, taking it back could be seen as insincere. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
