I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person gave $5 to two kids who asked for money. Then the older girl asked for $20 instead, so he took back the $5 and walked away. The girlfriend thinks it was a dick move.\n\nFirst, the initial act of giving $5 is a kind gesture. The problem arises when the girl changes the request to $20. The person didn't have to give any money, especially after the initial offer. The kids might have been testing or trying to get more than they first asked for. The author isn't obligated to meet the increased request. Taking back the $5 could be seen as a way to stop being taken advantage of. However, some might argue that once you part with money, it's not yours anymore, regardless of the situation. But the kids didn't actually have a need that the author knew about; they just looked untidy but not homeless. So the author might not be in the wrong because he had the right to withdraw his offer if the terms changed. The key point is consent and the initial agreement. The author gave $5 under the understanding that it was a small amount. When the request increased, he retracted his offer. That seems reasonable. So the answer is B.\n"
