I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person gave $5 to two girls, and when the older one asked for $20 instead, he took back the $5 and left. The question is whether he was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, when someone asks for money, it's typically a donation. The author gave $5, which is a choice. The girl then changing the amount might be a test or trying to get more. The author didn't have to give more, and taking back the $5 could be seen as a way to not be taken advantage of. However, in some contexts, taking back the money after giving it might be seen as stingy or not charitable. But since the girls weren't in obvious distress and the author felt they weren't truly in need, maybe it's understandable. The key points are the intent of the donation and the girls' behavior. If the girls were genuine, taking back the money could be considered selfish. But if they were just asking for more, the author is protecting himself. The answer might be B, not in the wrong, because it's a personal choice, and the author had the right to retract the donation before finalizing the exchange.\n"
