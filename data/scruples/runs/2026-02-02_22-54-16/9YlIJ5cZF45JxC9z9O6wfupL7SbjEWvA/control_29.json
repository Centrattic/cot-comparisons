I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the person gave $5 to two girls asking for money, but then when they said they wanted $20 instead, he asked for the $5 back and gave them a $20. His girlfriend thinks he was a dick, but he's unsure.\n\nFirst, when someone asks for money, giving them an amount you can spare is usually considered a kind gesture. In this case, the man gave $5 initially. Then the girl changed the request to $20. The problem here might be that the girls asked for more than the initial amount after receiving some money. But wait, the man didn't give them the $20 right away. He took back the $5 and gave them $20. So, he ended up giving $15 in total. But why did he do that?\n\nThe man's reasoning might be that he didn't want to give more than he was willing. However, taking back the $5 could be seen as stingy or not genuine if the girls were genuinely in need. The key here is whether the girls were actually in need. The author mentions they looked untidy but not homeless. So maybe they weren't in dire need, which could imply they were just asking for money for something else. \n\nBut from the girls' perspective, if they asked for $20 and he gave $5, then changed his mind and took back the $5 to give $20, it might look like he was being cheap at first and then trying to correct himself. However, the act of taking back the money might be confusing or even seen as dishonest if they were expecting the $5 to stay. \n\nAnother angle is that giving money to strangers can have risks, and the person might have realized they were being taken advantage of. However, if he chose to take back the $5 and give more, that shows he wasn't trying to deceive. But maybe the initial $5 was a mistake, and he corrected it. \n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that it was a dick move. Maybe because he gave the $5 and then took it back, which could be seen as not being genuine in the first place. People might expect that once you give money, you don't take it back unless there's a problem. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the girls were genuinely in need and he tried to give more after realizing they needed more, maybe he's in the right. But if he gave the $5 out of pity and then tried to correct himself by giving $20, but the way he did it was awkward (taking back the money), that could be seen as rude. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the girls were just testing people for pocket change. The author might have been wise not to give more than he was comfortable with, even if it meant retracting the initial $5. \n\nI think the main issue is whether retracting the money was deceptive. If he gave the $5 and then asked for it back to give $20, it could be seen as a good-hearted correction. But if the girls were expecting to get the $5 and then were taken back, maybe he should have just given $20 upfront instead of taking back the $5. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), because he corrected his mistake and ended up giving more. But others might argue that taking back money after giving it was a dick move, making the answer (A). But since the author's intention was to give more once he realized, perhaps B is the right choice.\n"
