I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves giving money to a young girl and her sister, then taking the money back after realizing they asked for more.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author gives $5 to a girl who then says they want $20. The author asks for the $5 back to give $20 instead. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move, but the author isn't sure. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nThe key points here are consent and the nature of the transaction. When someone gives money, it's usually a donation. If the recipient then changes their request, the giver isn't obligated to fulfill the new request. However, taking back money that was already given might be seen as deceptive or dishonest, depending on how it's done.\n\nWait, the author took back the $5 and walked away. But the girl initially asked for $5, then changed to $20. The author's logic is that they were willing to give $20, so they wanted the $5 back to give more. However, once the $5 is given, it's a completed transaction. To take it back might be considered breaking trust. But if the author explains the situation, maybe it's understandable. But the way it's done\u2014without the girl's consent\u2014could be problematic.\n\nAlso, the girl's age is a factor. If she's a child, the author might have been trying to be generous but then felt misled. But taking back the money after the exchange could be seen as taking advantage of the child's innocence.\n\nAnother angle: the author might have misunderstood the request. Maybe the girl was joking or confused. But by asking for the $5 back, the author could come off as trying to manipulate the situation. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that she thinks the author acted inconsiderately.\n\nI think there's a nuance here. On one hand, the author was trying to be generous but then felt the need to adjust the donation. On the other, taking back the money that was already given, especially from children, might be seen as inconsiderate or even exploitative. The fact that the children were not in obvious need (untidy but not homeless) might add to the complexity. The author might have been trying to help but then changed their mind, which could be seen as insincere.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Maybe. If they took back the money without the girl's permission, it could be considered a breach of trust. But if the girl was trying to get more money, the author might not be at fault. However, the act of taking back the money after the donation could be seen as dishonest regardless. I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the author was trying to correct their initial intent, but there's a counterargument. However, given the context that the children weren't in dire need, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
