I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by taking back the $5 after the little girl initially asked for $5 and then changed it to $20.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author gave $5, then the girl asked for $20. The author took back the $5 to give $20. The key point here is whether the girl was being truthful about her request. The author might have felt misled when the request changed. But in many places, there's an expectation that if someone asks for money and then increases the amount, the person giving the money isn't obligated to give more. \n\nHowever, there's a social norm aspect. The author might have been trying to help, and the girls' behavior could be seen as exploitative. On the other hand, the author's action of taking back the $5 could be seen as a way to correct a misunderstanding. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction is that it was a \"dick move,\" which suggests some social pressure. But the author's intention was to give $20, so taking back the $5 to fulfill the new request isn't inherently wrong. The problem might be the sudden change in the request. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they were responding to a changed request. They didn't have to give money in the first place, and when the terms changed, they adjusted accordingly. The girls might have been testing or trying to get more, but the author acted within their rights.\n"
