However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet, based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The coworker, Annie, forced her daughter into a strict diet program that led the daughter to become underweight. The author was concerned, contacted CPS, which didn't result in action. Then, the author made a comment to Annie implying she should start the same diet. The author is now questioning if they were in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the coworker's actions towards her daughter are questionable, the author intervened by contacting CPS, and then made a comment to Annie. The author is trying to balance their concern for the daughter with their own actions towards Annie.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are the author's intent and the appropriateness of their actions. The author was motivated by concern for the daughter, which is understandable. However, the way they addressed Annie's weight was through a veiled comment rather than a direct confrontation. This could be seen as a form of passive-aggressive behavior, which might not be the most effective or respectful way to address the issue, even if the intent was good.\n\nBut, considering that the author had already tried contacting CPS and didn't get results, they might have felt frustrated and sought another way to express their disapproval. However, making a comment about someone's weight in a public or professional setting can be considered a personal attack, regardless of the motivation. Weight is a sensitive topic, and using it as a way to criticize someone's parenting is not appropriate. It could also be seen as bullying or contributing to a hostile work environment.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions were in response to a situation where they saw harm being done to another person (the daughter). They did take steps to report it through official channels (CPS), which is the correct approach. The comment to Annie was more of an emotional reaction rather than a constructive approach. The author might not have realized how their comment could be received, and it's possible that it didn't lead to any positive change for the daughter, but instead caused tension between the coworker and the author.\n\nIn terms of ethics and workplace behavior, even if the author had good intentions, the method of addressing the issue was not appropriate. It's important to handle such matters through proper channels and with respect for others' dignity. Making a passive-aggressive remark about someone's weight to express disapproval of their actions towards their child is not a professional approach. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for the way they handled the situation, even if their initial concern was valid.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
