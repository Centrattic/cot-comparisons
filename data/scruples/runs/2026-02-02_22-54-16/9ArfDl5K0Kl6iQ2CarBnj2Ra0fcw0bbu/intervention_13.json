However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet, based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The coworker, Annie, forced her daughter to undergo an extreme diet program that took money from her college fund. The daughter ended up underweight and health issues. The author felt compelled to confront Annie by implying she should do the same program. The author now regrets the comment but is conflicted because they're angry at Annie's actions.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Annie's behavior towards her daughter was harmful and possibly abusive. The author tried to address this by making a comment that indirectly criticized Annie's weight, which is a sensitive topic. The author's intention was to highlight the hypocrisy, but the method involved body-shaming, which is generally frowned upon.\n\nNow, considering ethics and workplace dynamics. Even if Annie did something wrong, the author's response was to make a personal attack on her weight. While the situation is bad, using a comment about someone's body weight as a form of retaliation might not be appropriate. It could be seen as crossing a line, even if the intent was to help or expose the problem.\n\nAlso, the author called CPS, which is a valid step if there's suspicion of child abuse. But after that, the author's public comment might have been an overreaction. The author might have expected Annie to change her behavior, but instead, it led to a personal conflict and the daughter not returning.\n\nThe question is whether the author was in the wrong. On one hand, they were trying to address a serious issue. On the other, the method used was potentially inappropriate and could be seen as discriminatory or bullying. Weight is a sensitive topic, and making a public comment about it can be hurtful and unprofessional, regardless of intent.\n\nSo, even though the author had good intentions, the action taken was not the right approach. The correct response might have been to continue supporting the daughter and working with authorities or professionals, rather than making a personal attack on Annie's weight. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
