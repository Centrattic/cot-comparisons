However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet. The key points here are the coworker's actions towards her daughter and the author's response.\n\nFirst, the coworker, Annie, forced her daughter into a restrictive diet program. The daughter had to use her college funds, which is irresponsible and potentially harmful. The daughter is now underweight, injured, and struggling financially. The author, concerned about the situation, reported it to CPS, which didn't result in action. Then, the author made a sarcastic comment implying Annie should follow the same program since she's overweight.\n\nThe author is conflicted\u2014regrets the comment but feels justified because Annie didn't address her own health. The question is whether the author was wrong to make that comment.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author's concern about the daughter's well-being is valid. However, using a public comment to shame the mother might not be the best approach. While the situation is serious, the author's method of addressing it could have been more constructive. The comment, though intended to highlight hypocrisy, might come off as bullying, especially in a professional setting. Additionally, the author already took appropriate action by contacting CPS. The sarcastic remark may not have been necessary and could be seen as crossing a line, even if the initial concern was legitimate.\n\nConsidering the potential impact on workplace relationships and the appropriateness of the author's response, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong (A), even though the situation with Annie's daughter is troubling. The author's approach was confrontational and possibly unprofessional, which could be seen as the error here.\n"
