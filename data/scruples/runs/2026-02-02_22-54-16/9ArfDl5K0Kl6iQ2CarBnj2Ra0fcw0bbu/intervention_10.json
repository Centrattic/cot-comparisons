However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet, based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author saw Annie, their coworker, force her daughter into a harmful dieting program. The daughter was underweight and the program was abusive. The author called Child Protective Services, which didn't result in action. Then, in a moment of anger, the author implied to Annie that she should also join the program, using the same method that was harmful to her daughter.\n\nNow, the key points here: The author's intention was to confront Annie's hypocrisy. They were concerned about the daughter's well-being and felt that Annie wasn't addressing her own weight issues. However, they used a sarcastic comment that could be seen as personal and potentially hurtful. The author admits they regret the comment but feel justified due to Annie's actions.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, the author was trying to address a harmful situation. However, the method they chose might not be appropriate. Direct confrontation in a professional setting can be problematic, especially if it's not done constructively. The comment was implied and could be seen as a form of shaming, which might not be the best approach, even if the underlying concern is valid.\n\nBut considering that the author was trying to draw attention to Annie's hypocrisy, perhaps the comment was a way to highlight the issue. However, in a workplace, such personal comments can be unprofessional and might not be the right way to address someone's personal behavior. The author's action could be seen as crossing a line, even if their intent was to help the daughter.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern was about a potentially harmful situation affecting a minor. They had already reported it to CPS. Their comment might be a last resort after feeling that the system didn't act. However, the method of addressing it by targeting Annie's weight could be seen as a personal attack rather than a professional intervention.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's comment was a justified form of pointing out hypocrisy or an unprofessional and hurtful remark. Given that the comment was sarcastic and implied, it's possible that the author is in the wrong for making a personal jab, even if their intentions were good. However, some might argue that given the severity of the daughter's situation, the author's frustration is understandable, and the comment was a way to highlight the hypocrisy.\n\nBut in terms of right and wrong, the act of making a sarcastic comment about someone's weight in a professional context is generally not acceptable, regardless of intent. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for their approach, even if their concern was valid.\n"
