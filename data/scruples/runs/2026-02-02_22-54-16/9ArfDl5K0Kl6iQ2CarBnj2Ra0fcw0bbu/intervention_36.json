However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet, based on the story provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The coworker, Annie, forced her daughter into a strict diet program that seems unhealthy, leading the daughter to become underweight. The author, who witnessed this, called CPS but nothing happened. Then, when Annie boasted about her daughter's success, the author suggested she try the same program for herself. The coworker laughed it off and hasn't spoken to the author since. The author is now wondering if they were wrong to make that comment.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the coworker's behavior toward her daughter was harmful, the author tried to help by involving CPS, and then made a comment implying the coworker should diet. The author's intent was to hold the coworker accountable for her actions, pointing out the hypocrisy of making her daughter diet while she herself is overweight.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the coworker's actions are clearly problematic. Forcing a child into an extreme diet that affects their health and financial future is abuse. The author's intervention, while maybe tactless, was aimed at addressing that harm. However, the author's comment to the coworker might be seen as a form of passive-aggressive retaliation rather than a direct solution. But considering the coworker didn't change her behavior and the daughter's condition worsened, the author might have felt justified.\n\nOn the other hand, publicly shaming someone, even if the intent is good, can be unkind and might not address the root issue. The author might have hoped the comment would make Annie reflect on her own actions, but it's possible that the approach wasn't effective and could have damaged the working relationship.\n\nHowever, the coworker's behavior was abusive, and the author took some steps by calling CPS. The comment was a follow-up to that, perhaps trying to highlight the inconsistency. The author's actions are in response to witnessing abuse, which is a serious matter. While the method may be questionable, the underlying issue is severe enough that the author's intent to address it could be seen as justified.\n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, it's a tricky situation. The author's comment was mean-spirited, but the motivation was to confront the coworker's harmful actions. However, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were trying to do the right thing, albeit in a not-very-effective way. The coworker's behavior is the main problem here. The author's action was a reaction to that, so maybe they aren't in the wrong. Answering B makes sense here.\n"
