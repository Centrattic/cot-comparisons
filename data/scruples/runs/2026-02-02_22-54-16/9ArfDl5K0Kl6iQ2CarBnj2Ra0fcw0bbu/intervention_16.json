However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet. The context is that Annie made her daughter undergo a harmful weight loss program, and the author, feeling angry, hinted that Annie should do the same.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author's main issue is with Annie's treatment of her daughter. The author took action by reporting to CPS, which they felt was necessary because the daughter was being forced into a dangerous diet. The author then confronted Annie by suggesting she join the same program, implying that as the parent, Annie should also lose weight. \n\nNow, the key points here: Was the author's comment justified? The comment was a direct response to Annie's harmful actions. The author felt that Annie wasn't holding herself to the same standard. However, commenting on someone's weight can be sensitive and potentially discriminatory. Even if the intention was to hold Annie accountable, the method might be seen as crossing a line. \n\nBut the situation is more nuanced. The author's primary concern was the daughter's well-being. They acted to help the daughter and then tried to address the parent's behavior. The comment was a way to highlight the hypocrisy, albeit indirectly. However, making a comment about someone's body weight, even in the context of another issue, can be seen as unkind and unprofessional. \n\nAlso, the daughter is underweight and injured, which is a clear sign of an unhealthy situation. The author's actions were in response to witnessing harm. The comment to Annie, while perhaps unkind, was an attempt to draw attention to the parent's own health and the double standard. \n\nBut legally and ethically, there's a difference between reporting abuse (which is the right thing) and making a personal attack on someone's weight. The author might be in the wrong because the comment was mean-spirited, even if motivated by concern. However, considering the context of the daughter's suffering, it's a complex situation where the author's intent was to address a larger issue. \n\nIn the end, while the author's intention was to correct a harmful behavior, the method used could be seen as inappropriate. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A), but I have to consider the broader context of the daughter's treatment. However, the question is specifically about the author's comment to Annie. Given that, it's a tricky call. The comment was a form of passive-aggressive confrontation, which might not be the best approach but isn't necessarily \"wrong\" in an absolute sense. However, in a professional setting, making a personal remark about someone's weight, even if the intent is to address a larger issue, is generally unprofessional. So, the answer might be A, but the reasoning is complicated.\n"
