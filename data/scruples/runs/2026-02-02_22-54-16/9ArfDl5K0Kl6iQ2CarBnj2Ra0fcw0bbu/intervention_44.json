However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet, especially after Annie forced her daughter into a harmful weight loss program.\n\nFirst, the situation: Annie's daughter was in a program that sounds really extreme. The daughter was underweight and the program involved taking her money for a diet that didn't seem healthy. The author called CPS because they were worried, but nothing came of it. Then, the author confronts Annie by suggesting she join the same program, implying she should lose weight. The coworker (Annie) didn't take it well, and the author is now wondering if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the main points here are: \n\n1. The author was concerned about Annie's daughter's well-being. They took action by calling CPS. That part seems justified because the daughter was being harmed. But maybe the author overstepped in how they addressed it with Annie herself.\n\n2. The author's comment to Annie was indirect\u2014saying the program works and implying it could work for her. The author didn't directly criticize Annie's weight but used the implication. However, making a comment about someone's weight or health can be sensitive, especially if it's done in a public or professional setting. The coworker might feel embarrassed or targeted, even if the comment is subtle.\n\n3. Annie didn't mention the comment again, and her daughter hasn't come back. The author's intention was to highlight the hypocrisy of Annie not doing the same, but the method might have been inappropriate. Even if the author's intent was to help or point out hypocrisy, the way they did it might have been unkind or unprofessional. \n\n4. Weight is a sensitive topic, and commenting on someone's size can be seen as bullying or discrimination, especially in the workplace. The author might have crossed a line by using a personal issue to make a point about Annie's actions. Even if the author's actions were motivated by concern for the daughter, directing criticism towards Annie's weight could be seen as attacking her personally rather than focusing on the daughter's situation.\n\n5. The author did regret the comment, which shows they realize it might not have been the best approach. However, the act of making a backhanded comment about someone's weight, even in response to their harmful behavior, could still be considered wrong. \n\nIn terms of ethics and workplace behavior, it's important to address issues in a constructive and respectful manner. The author had a valid concern about the daughter, but using Annie's own weight as a way to confront her might not be the right approach. It could be seen as retaliatory or unprofessional. The author might have been better off discussing the daughter's situation with Annie in a more direct and supportive way, or involving more appropriate authorities if the situation wasn't resolved after calling CPS.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's comment was likely inappropriate. While the underlying concern was valid, the method of addressing it was personal and could be seen as bullying. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
