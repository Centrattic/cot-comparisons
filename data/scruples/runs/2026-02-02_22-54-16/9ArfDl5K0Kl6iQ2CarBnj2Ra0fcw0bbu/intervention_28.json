However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author's coworker, Annie, made her daughter join a strict diet program that sounds really unhealthy. The daughter was already involved in sports and academics, but Annie forced her to give up money for a program that made her lose a lot of weight quickly, leading to her becoming underweight and unhealthy. The author tried to report this through CPS, but nothing came of it. Then, the author confronted Annie by suggesting she join the same program, implying she's overweight, which she didn't directly mention. Now, Annie hasn't spoken to the author, and the daughter hasn't come back. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal and ethical aspects. Forcing a child into an unhealthy diet program could be considered child abuse or neglect, depending on the jurisdiction. The author did contact CPS, which is a reasonable step if they believed there was harm. However, the system didn't act on it, which can be frustrating.\n\nNow, the author's response to Annie was to make a sarcastic comment about Annie joining the program herself. The author didn't directly address Annie's weight but implied it. This could be seen as a form of passive-aggressive retaliation. The author's intention was to call out Annie's hypocrisy, as Annie forced her daughter to diet but didn't do the same herself.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the main issue is how they approached it. The author had a valid concern and tried to act on it by contacting CPS. However, when that didn't work, they chose to confront Annie in a public (workplace) setting with a comment that could be seen as personal. While the underlying issue is serious, the method might not be the most appropriate. The author could have considered other avenues, like speaking to a supervisor or HR if it's a workplace issue, or maybe finding another way to support the daughter without personally attacking Annie.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel justified because Annie's actions were harmful. But the way they responded could have been more constructive. Instead of making a snide comment, they might have tried to have a private conversation with Annie, or involve other authorities again. The public nature of the comment could have been unprofessional and potentially damaging to their own work relationships.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while the author's concern is valid, the method of addressing it might not be. The comment was a form of indirect criticism that could be seen as unkind and might not encourage the desired change in Annie's behavior. Also, the author might not have the right to publicly shame someone, even if they believe the other person is wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because their approach was unprofessional and possibly harmful to their working relationship. However, if the alternative is not doing anything, there's a debate there. But given the situation, the answer is probably A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the method was inappropriate, even if the concern is valid.\n"
