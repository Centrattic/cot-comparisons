However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet. The situation involves Annie's daughter being forced into a restrictive weight loss program, which the author found concerning and even reported to CPS. The author then made a sarcastic comment implying Annie should join the program herself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's coworker, Annie, is being criticized for her actions towards her daughter, which could be seen as harmful. The author's comment was a form of passive-aggressive retaliation for not wanting to repeat the same behavior. However, making such a comment about someone's weight can be considered bullying or body-shaming, which is generally not acceptable in a professional setting.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the author's intent. They were trying to draw a parallel between Annie's treatment of her daughter and Annie's own weight, suggesting that she should focus on herself. However, the method used (publicly implying she should diet) might be considered inappropriate, even if the concern was valid. The author had already taken action by calling CPS, which shows they had good intentions to help the daughter. However, the comment might have crossed a line by targeting Annie's weight, which isn't directly related to the daughter's situation.\n\nAnother angle is the potential harm caused by the author's comment. By making that remark, the author might have damaged the working relationship with Annie, and possibly caused her distress. Even if the author was trying to make a point, the approach was likely unprofessional. The workplace isn't the appropriate place to address personal issues, especially sensitive ones like body weight.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern about the daughter's well-being is valid. However, the solution was to involve authorities (CPS) which is the right step, rather than making a personal jab. The comment might have been a justified reaction to Annie's harmful behavior, but the method was flawed. \n\nIn many cases, direct confrontation or public shaming isn't effective or appropriate. The author's comment could be seen as a form of passive aggression rather than a constructive approach. It's possible that the author hoped to encourage Annie to reflect on her actions through their comment, but the outcome might have been counterproductive.\n\nConsidering all these points, while the author's concern about the daughter's welfare is commendable, the way they addressed Annie's behavior was inappropriate. The comment about Annie's weight was not the right approach in a professional setting and could be viewed as bullying or unprofessional. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for making that sarcastic remark.\n"
