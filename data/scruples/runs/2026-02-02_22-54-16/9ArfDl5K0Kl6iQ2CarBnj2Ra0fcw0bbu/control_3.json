However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet, based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the context. The coworker, Annie, made her daughter go through a strict diet program that led the daughter to become severely underweight. The author, who witnessed this, tried to call out Annie by implying she should do the same diet. The author is now wondering if they were in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Annie's actions towards her daughter are questionable and possibly harmful. The author tried to confront Annie indirectly by suggesting she join the same program. The author's intent was to highlight the hypocrisy, but they're now regretful but also justified because of Annie's behavior.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, maybe not, but ethically? Well, the author's main issue is that they felt compelled to act because of Annie's harmful actions. However, the method they used was to imply that Annie should lose weight, which is a sensitive topic. \n\nIn many cases, commenting on someone's weight can be considered inappropriate or even discriminatory, especially in a workplace. Even if the author's intention was to point out Annie's hypocrisy, the approach might have been unprofessional. The author might have crossed a line by making a passive-aggressive comment about someone's body, regardless of the underlying reasons.\n\nHowever, there's also an argument that the author was trying to help the daughter by confronting the mother. The problem is that the author's method was indirect and could be seen as a personal attack rather than addressing the real issue (Annie's treatment of her daughter). The author could have tried a different approach, like reporting to authorities if they were concerned about the daughter's welfare, instead of making a comment about the mother's weight.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's action, while possibly well-intentioned, was probably unprofessional and inappropriate. They focused on the mother's weight rather than addressing the child's welfare directly through the proper channels. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because making a comment about someone's body, even if they've done something wrong, isn't the right approach. The author should have addressed the situation differently, perhaps by involving proper authorities or finding another way to support the daughter without targeting the mother's weight.\n"
