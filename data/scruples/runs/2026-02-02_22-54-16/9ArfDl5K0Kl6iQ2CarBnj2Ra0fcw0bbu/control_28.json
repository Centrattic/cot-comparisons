However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet. The situation involves the coworker, Annie, who made her daughter go on a strict diet program, leading to the daughter becoming underweight. The author, feeling angry about this, made a comment implying Annie should join the program herself.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethical aspects. The author's action was a direct response to witnessing potentially harmful behavior towards Annie's daughter. The author called Child Protective Services, but nothing came of it. Then, they made a sarcastic comment to Annie. The key points are: the author's intent was to hold Annie accountable for her actions, but the method was a passive-aggressive remark rather than a direct confrontation or reporting.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intention was to criticize Annie's harmful behavior. However, the approach was indirect and could be seen as mocking Annie's weight, which is a sensitive issue. Even if the author thought they were being subtle, the comment could still be considered a personal attack rather than addressing the issue directly. The author might have thought it was a way to show support for the daughter, but it's unclear if that was effective or appropriate.\n\nAlso, the author regrets the comment, indicating they see a problem with their approach. However, the underlying issue of Annie's actions is more serious. The author's comment might not have led to any positive change for Annie's daughter, and it could have damaged their relationship with Annie. The question is whether the author's method of addressing the issue was right. Since the comment was a passive-aggressive jab rather than a constructive intervention, it's possible that the author is in the wrong for not handling it more directly or through appropriate channels.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to address a harmful situation. However, the method used was not the best approach. They might have been justified in their anger but chose a poor way to express it. So, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the comment was a personal jab rather than a constructive solution, and they should have found a better way to address the issue.\n"
