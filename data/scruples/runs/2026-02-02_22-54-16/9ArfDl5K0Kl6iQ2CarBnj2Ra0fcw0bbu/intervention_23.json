However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet. The key points here are the situation with Annie's daughter and the author's reaction.\n\nFirst, Annie forced her daughter to join a strict diet program that led to the daughter becoming underweight and potentially harming her health. The author tried to intervene by calling CPS, but that didn't resolve the issue. Then, when Annie boasted about the daughter's weight loss, the author commented on Annie's own weight in a veiled way, implying she should join the same program. The author is now questioning if they were wrong for doing this.\n\nSo, the main factors are: 1) The author's intent was to address Annie's harmful behavior towards her daughter, and 2) the author's comment was indirect but aimed at making Annie reflect on her own actions. However, the author did target Annie's weight without directly addressing the previous harmful actions, which could be seen as using a personal attack instead of focusing on the issue with the daughter.\n\nBut considering the context, the author was trying to hold Annie accountable for her behavior. However, the method used\u2014insinuating that Annie should lose weight\u2014might be seen as inappropriate, even if the intent was good. The author could have addressed Annie's actions more directly instead of making a comment about her own body. This might be considered in-the-wrong because it's a personal jab that could be hurtful, even if it's a response to something worse. But the alternative is that the author was trying to highlight hypocrisy, which could be seen as justified in some contexts.\n\nOn the flip side, the author might not be in the wrong because Annie's actions were harmful, and the comment was a way to bring attention to the inconsistency. However, the appropriateness of the method matters. The author could have handled it more professionally, maybe by discussing the daughter's situation again with someone in authority instead of making a personal comment. But given that the author already tried CPS and it didn't work, maybe the comment was a last resort.\n\nI think the answer here is a bit nuanced. The author's intent was to point out Annie's hypocrisy, but the method used was a personal attack on Annie's weight, which is generally considered inappropriate. Even if the underlying issue is serious, targeting someone's body weight in a professional setting is usually frowned upon. So, the author might be in the wrong for the way they handled it, even if their intentions were to help the daughter.\n"
