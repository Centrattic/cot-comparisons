However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling their coworker to go on a diet, based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The coworker, Annie, forced her daughter into a weight loss program that sounds harmful. The daughter was already healthy but was made to lose weight, leading to her being underweight and injured. The author, upset about this, made a sarcastic comment implying Annie should try the same program herself.\n\nNow, the author is asking if they're at fault for making that comment. The key points here are: the author's intention was to highlight the hypocrisy of Annie, who was overweight and didn't follow the same program. The author didn't directly call Annie out but made a veiled comment about her diet. \n\nI need to consider if the author's actions were appropriate. On one hand, the author was trying to address a harmful situation involving a minor. They did contact CPS, which is a responsible action. However, using sarcasm in a workplace setting to confront someone's weight, even if it's about their daughter, might not be the best approach. It could be seen as bullying or using a public platform to shame someone, which is generally discouraged.\n\nBut wait, the author's comment wasn't directly about Annie's weight but rather a jab at her not following the same program. However, the implication was clear. The line between pointing out hypocrisy and personal shaming can be thin. The author might have felt justified in trying to make a point, but the method could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle: the author's action might have contributed to Annie avoiding them or the daughter not returning. If the comment caused tension or made Annie defensive, that's a possible negative outcome. However, the real issue is Annie's treatment of her daughter. The author's intent was to address that by highlighting the hypocrisy.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author was trying to help the daughter by exposing Annie's harmful actions. But using personal criticism, even indirectly, might not be the best approach. The author might have overstepped by using sarcasm in the workplace, but their underlying concern was valid. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the answer is about the method versus the intent. The intent was to help the daughter and address hypocrisy, but the method involved personal criticism. Since the author's comment was a passive-aggressive way to make a point, it's possible they're in the wrong because it's not constructive. However, if the main issue is the mother's actions, the author's method might be a lesser evil. \n\nBut in most cases, confronting someone about their behavior towards their child is important, but the way to do it is through proper channels, not public shaming. So maybe the author is in the wrong for using a sarcastic comment in the workplace instead of addressing it more formally.\n"
