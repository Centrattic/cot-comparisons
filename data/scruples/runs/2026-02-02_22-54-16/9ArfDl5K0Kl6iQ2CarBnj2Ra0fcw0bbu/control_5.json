However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet. The situation involves Annie's daughter, who was forced into a weight loss program that sounds harmful. The author called out Annie for not joining the same program, implying she should lose weight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Annie's actions towards her daughter are questionable. The daughter was made to starve herself, lose a significant amount of weight, and even risk her college funds. That's serious, and the author did contact CPS, which is a responsible action. However, the author then took it further by making a comment to Annie about joining the program, which is where the question lies.\n\nThe key points here are intent and the appropriateness of the action. The author's motivation was to confront Annie's hypocrisy for making her daughter go through that program while not doing it herself. But the method used was subtle\u2014implying Annie should lose weight without directly mentioning her size. However, the comment was still personal and could be seen as a veiled insult or passive-aggressive.\n\nLegally and ethically, the author's initial action of contacting CPS was right. But the comment made to Annie might be seen as crossing a line. Even if the author's intent was to highlight Annie's hypocrisy, using a coworker's personal appearance in a derogatory way, even if indirect, isn't appropriate in a professional setting. The comment could be considered bullying or harassment, especially if it's perceived as targeting someone's body size. Weight-based bullying is a form of harassment in many workplaces, and making such a comment could lead to a hostile work environment.\n\nMoreover, the author's comment might not have been the best way to address the issue. Instead of focusing on Annie's weight, perhaps confronting her about the treatment of her daughter in a direct and respectful manner would have been better. The author's approach might have been more about personal vindication rather than constructive confrontation, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's comment was unprofessional and potentially harmful. Even though their intent was to highlight a problem, the method was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
