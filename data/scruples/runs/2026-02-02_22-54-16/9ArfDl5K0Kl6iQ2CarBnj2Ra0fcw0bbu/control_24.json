However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet. The situation involves Annie's daughter who was in a restrictive weight loss program, and the author called out Annie for not doing the same.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author witnessed Annie forcing her daughter into a strict diet that led to the daughter becoming underweight and unhealthy. They contacted CPS but nothing came from it. Then, the author made a comment implying Annie should also do the program, which was a veiled insult about her weight. The question is if the author is at fault.\n\nSo, let's consider both sides. On one hand, Annie's actions towards her daughter are concerning. She used her daughter's money, forced her into an unhealthy diet, and disregarded her well-being. The author tried to help by reporting to CPS but that didn't work. Then they made a comment to Annie, which might have been the only way they felt to address the situation. However, the author's approach was indirect\u2014implying Annie should lose weight without directly confronting her about her daughter's treatment.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author's comment targeted Annie's own weight, which could be seen as bullying or using body shaming. It's possible that the comment was not effective in addressing the real issue with Annie's behavior towards her daughter. Instead, it focused on Annie's appearance, which might not have been the best approach and could have come across as hypocritical or mean-spirited, especially if the author isn't in a position to judge others' bodies.\n\nAlso, making a comment in the workplace about someone's weight, even if the intention is to point out hypocrisy, could be inappropriate and potentially hostile. The author might have thought they were helping by calling out Annie's hypocrisy, but using body shaming as a method might not be the right approach. It's possible that the author's actions could be seen as crossing a line, even if their intentions were to help the daughter.\n\nAnother angle is the effectiveness of the author's action. The comment didn't lead to any positive change, and it caused a rift between them. Annie stopped talking to the author, and the daughter didn't return. The author's regret suggests they realize the comment might have been harsh. However, their anger at Annie's actions towards her daughter is understandable. The challenge here is balancing the need to address harmful behavior without resorting to methods that could be considered bullying.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author's primary concern should have been the daughter's well-being. Reporting to CPS was the right step, but since that didn't result in action, the author tried another approach. However, using a personal attack on Annie's weight might not be the most effective or ethical way to address the issue. It's important to consider that even with good intentions, the method used can be problematic.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's intention was to help the daughter by confronting Annie, but the method chosen was a personal attack on Annie's body, which can be seen as wrong. Body shaming is generally not a constructive approach and can be harmful. The author's actions, while motivated by concern, may have been inappropriate and ineffective. Therefore, the author could be considered at fault for using body shaming as a response, even if they intended to address a serious issue.\n"
