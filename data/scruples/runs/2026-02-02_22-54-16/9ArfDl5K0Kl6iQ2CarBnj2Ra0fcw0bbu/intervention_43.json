However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe coworker, Annie, made her daughter go through an extreme dieting program, taking her money for a weight loss scheme that sounds harmful. The daughter was already involved in sports and academics, but Annie forced her to lose weight, leading to the daughter becoming underweight and injured. The author, witnessing this, felt compelled to confront Annie by suggesting she join the same program, implying she should lose weight. Now they're questioning if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethical implications of the author's action. The main issue here is the author's response to witnessing potentially abusive behavior by Annie towards her daughter. The author's comment was a backhanded way to criticize Annie's actions by pointing out her own weight. But is this appropriate?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, Annie's actions seem problematic. Forcing a daughter into a restrictive diet, especially one that's financially burdensome and potentially harmful, is concerning. The author intervened by calling out Annie's hypocrisy, which might be seen as a way to expose the issue. However, the method used was a veiled insult rather than a direct confrontation. \n\nIn terms of workplace conduct, the author's comment could be seen as unprofessional. Direct confrontation might be more appropriate, especially if there's a need to address something as serious as potential child abuse. But the author already reported to CPS, so maybe they felt that the comment was a form of holding Annie accountable. \n\nThe author regrets the comment but feels justified in anger. The question is whether the means (implying Annie should lose weight) were the right way to express concern. It's possible that the author's comment was more about personal frustration than helping Annie, which could be seen as hypocritical or bullying. However, given Annie's harmful behavior, the author's intent was to highlight the hypocrisy, which might be understandable.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author didn't physically or emotionally harm Annie, but the comment was a form of public shaming. Whether that's acceptable depends on cultural and personal ethics. Legally, unless the comment was harassment, it might not be a violation, but ethically, it's a gray area. The author's main fault might be not addressing the situation through proper channels (like HR or direct confrontation) instead of using a passive-aggressive approach.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's primary responsibility was to protect the daughter, which they did by reporting to CPS. The comment was a personal reaction, which might not be the best approach but isn't necessarily \"in the wrong\" since the main issue was the daughter's treatment, not the author's comment per se. Therefore, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
