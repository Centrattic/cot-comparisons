However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet, after witnessing Annie's harmful behavior towards her daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Annie is forcing her daughter, who was already healthy and involved in sports, to join a strict diet program, taking her college funds, and the daughter ended up underweight and sick. The author, concerned, called CPS, which didn't result in action. Then, the author confronted Annie by suggesting she join the same program, implying she needs to lose weight. The author is now questioning if they were wrong.\n\nI should consider the key points here. The main issue is whether the author's response was appropriate. The author's coworker did something harmful to her daughter, and the author tried to address it by pointing out the hypocrisy. However, the method used was a passive-aggressive comment about the coworker's weight.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author had a valid concern about the daughter's well-being. But directly addressing the mother's weight, even implicitly, might not be the best approach. It could be seen as shaming, which might not be effective and could damage the working relationship. The author might have intended to highlight the hypocrisy but could have chosen a different method, like discussing it more directly with Annie or involving a higher authority if necessary.\n\nAlso, considering workplace dynamics, making a comment about someone's weight, even if it's implied, could be problematic. It might not be within the author's role to address this in a personal manner. The author's main issue is Annie's treatment of her daughter, not her weight, so the approach might have been misdirected.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to help the daughter by confronting the mother, which shows concern. However, the method was perhaps not the most constructive. The author might have regretted the comment, indicating that they recognize it wasn't the best approach, even if they felt justified.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's method was appropriate. While the concern is valid, the approach taken could be seen as shaming and not addressing the root issue effectively. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the way they handled it, even if their intentions were good.\n"
