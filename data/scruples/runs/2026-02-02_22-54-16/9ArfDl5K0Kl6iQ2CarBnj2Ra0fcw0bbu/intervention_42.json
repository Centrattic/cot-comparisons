However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet, based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The coworker, Annie, forced her daughter to join a strict diet program, taking the daughter's college funds, leading her to become underweight and injured. The author, concerned, reported it to CPS, but nothing came of it. Then, when Annie was boasting about the daughter's success, the author implied she should try the same diet herself. The author is now wondering if they were right to do that.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) Annie's actions towards her daughter were harmful and unethical, 2) The author tried to address the issue by reporting to CPS but that didn't work, 3) The author then made a sarcastic comment implying Annie should lose weight, which led to tension.\n\nNow, the ethical dilemma is whether pointing out Annie's own weight was appropriate. The author's intention was to highlight the hypocrisy. However, even if the intent was good, publicly suggesting someone lose weight can be seen as rude or discriminatory, regardless of the context. Weight-related comments can be sensitive and potentially contribute to body shaming, which is generally frowned upon in the workplace.\n\nEven though Annie's behavior towards her daughter was concerning, the author's method of addressing it by making a personal comment about her weight might not be the right approach. The author had already taken steps (calling CPS), so maybe a more direct approach to confront Annie about her treatment of her daughter would have been better than a sarcastic remark.\n\nIn terms of workplace etiquette, making a comment about someone's weight, even if it's a veiled suggestion, isn't appropriate. It's possible that the author wanted to highlight the hypocrisy, but the method used could be seen as unprofessional and possibly offensive. The author might be justified in their anger but not in their method of response.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for the way they handled it, even if the underlying issue with Annie was problematic. The correct approach might have been to address the daughter's situation more directly or support her through other means, rather than making a comment about Annie's weight.\n"
