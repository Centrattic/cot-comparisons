However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author, let's call them \"Person A,\" works with Annie, who is very nice but does some bad things. Annie's daughter was going into her senior year, saving money for college. Annie made her daughter join a diet program that required her to lose 10% of her body weight in 3 months. The program involved a restrictive diet and the daughter had to use her college funds. The daughter ended up underweight, injured, and sick. Person A reported this to CPS, but nothing came of it. Then, when Annie was boasting about the daughter's success, Person A confronted her by suggesting she join the same program, implying she's overweight. Now Person A is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's consider the main points. Annie's actions towards her daughter are questionable. Forcing a teenager, especially one involved in sports and academics, into a restrictive diet that leads to underweight and health issues sounds like an eating disorder. The program seems exploitative, taking money and not providing adequate nutrition. Person A tried to help by contacting CPS, which is a responsible action. However, the home visit didn't result in any action, which is frustrating.\n\nNow, when Person A confronted Annie, they didn't directly accuse her but used implication. The comment was meant to point out the hypocrisy of Annie forcing her daughter into a program she herself isn't following. The question is whether this reaction was appropriate.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's intention was to confront the hypocrisy and perhaps encourage Annie to address her own weight issue. However, the method used was a veiled insult. Even if the author's motivation was to help the daughter, the approach might have been unprofessional. By making a comment that implies Annie is overweight without directly addressing the issue with her daughter, the author could be seen as crossing a line. It's possible that the comment was a form of passive aggression rather than a constructive approach.\n\nOn the other hand, Annie's actions were harmful, and the author had valid concerns. The author might feel justified in trying to highlight the hypocrisy, but the way it was done might not be the best method. The author could have escalated the issue through proper channels instead of making a personal jab. Since the daughter is already affected and the CPS didn't act, maybe the author should have focused on that rather than confront Annie directly in a work environment where such topics are sensitive.\n\nAlso, the author's comment could be considered a form of shaming, which might not be effective and could damage workplace relationships. Even if the intention was good, the method might be inappropriate. So, the author might be in the wrong for handling it that way instead of continuing to support the daughter through appropriate means or reporting the issue again if necessary.\n"
