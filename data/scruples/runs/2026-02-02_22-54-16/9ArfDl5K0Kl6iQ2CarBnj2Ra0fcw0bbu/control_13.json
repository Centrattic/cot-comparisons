However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet, based on the story provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The coworker, Annie, forced her daughter into a restrictive diet program that led the daughter to become underweight. The author called out Annie for not doing the same program herself, implying she should lose weight. The author is now questioning if they did the right thing.\n\nSo, the main points here: Annie's actions towards her daughter are concerning. The author took action by calling out Annie, which might be seen as a way to address the problem indirectly. But was it the right approach?\n\nThe author's intention was to point out the hypocrisy, but the method was public and indirect. The daughter is now not coming back to the office, which could indicate that the situation is sensitive and maybe the author's comment caused more issues. However, the original issue is about the daughter's well-being. The author did report to CPS earlier, so they were trying to help. But the comment might have crossed a line by targeting Annie's weight instead of focusing on the daughter's welfare. The author might have violated privacy or used a public shaming approach, which isn't effective and could be inappropriate. Even though Annie's actions were harmful, the author's response might not be the right way to handle it. So, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because they addressed the issue in a way that targeted the mother's weight publicly without a direct, constructive approach.\n"
