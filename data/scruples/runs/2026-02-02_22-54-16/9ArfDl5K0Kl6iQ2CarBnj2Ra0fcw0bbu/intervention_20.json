However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a coworker named Annie who forced her daughter to go on an extreme diet, leading the daughter to become severely underweight. The author, after seeing the negative effects on the daughter, made a sarcastic comment implying that Annie should try the same diet. Now the author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is whether the author's comment was an appropriate response to Annie's harmful behavior. Let's break it down. \n\nAnnie's actions: She took her daughter's money intended for college and forced her into a restrictive diet program. The daughter, who was already active in sports and academics, ended up underweight and injured. The author reported this to CPS, which did a home visit but found no action. The author felt it was necessary to act after seeing the daughter's condition and the financial strain.\n\nThe author's response: They made a sarcastic comment suggesting Annie should join the program herself. This was a public shaming of sorts, using the situation to imply that Annie needed to lose weight. The author didn't directly accuse Annie of wrongdoing but used the daughter's success to imply hypocrisy.\n\nNow, to evaluate if the author was wrong. The author's intent was to highlight the hypocrisy and perhaps show support for the daughter. However, making a public comment like that could be seen as bullying or adding to the problem. Even if the author's intention was to draw attention to the issue, the method might not be the best. \n\nBut on the other hand, Annie's actions were harmful and the author tried to help by reporting and then making a point. The author might feel justified in trying to call out Annie's behavior. However, the author's comment could also be seen as crossing a line, even if it was meant to be a pointed critique. It's a delicate situation where the author's intent is to address a wrong, but their method might not be the most constructive.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's comment was an appropriate way to address the issue. While the situation with Annie is definitely problematic, the author's approach could be seen as revenge or public shaming rather than a constructive solution. The author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to highlight the issue, but their method might not have been the best. However, depending on the perspective, the author could be considered in the wrong for making a personal jab instead of addressing the issue through proper channels or directly supporting the daughter. \n\nBut considering that the author had already reported to CPS and the daughter is now avoiding the office, the author's comment might have been a last resort. The answer might lean towards \"No,\" the author is not in the wrong because they were trying to address a harmful situation, even if the method was harsh.\n"
