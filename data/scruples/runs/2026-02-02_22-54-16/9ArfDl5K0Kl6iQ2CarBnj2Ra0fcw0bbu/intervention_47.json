However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet, especially after witnessing Annie's harmful actions towards her daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker's daughter was forced into an extreme diet program, leading to health issues. The author, witnessing this, felt it was necessary to confront Annie. The author's comment was a jab at Annie's own weight, implying hypocrisy since Annie enforced a strict diet on her daughter but didn't follow it herself. The key here is whether the author's response was appropriate or if they overstepped.\n\nThe author's intention seems to be to address the injustice they observed. However, the method used\u2014calling out Annie's weight in a public work setting\u2014might be seen as a personal attack rather than addressing the underlying issue of the daughter's treatment. Even though the comment was indirect (not directly saying \"you're overweight\"), the implication was clear. This could be considered unprofessional and potentially discriminatory, as commenting on someone's weight can be a sensitive and personal matter, especially in a workplace.\n\nAdditionally, the author did take action by contacting CPS when they noticed the daughter's condition, which shows concern. But the follow-up comment to Annie might have been a misguided way to express that concern. The author's frustration is understandable, but the approach risked escalating personal conflict and could have made Annie defensive, possibly hindering future communication or support.\n\nAlso, considering the daughter's situation, the author might have been trying to highlight the hypocrisy without directly confronting Annie about her parenting. However, the comment about the program working on the author could be seen as a form of shaming, which might not be effective in changing Annie's behavior and could instead cause resentment.\n\nIn terms of ethics, is it right to call out someone's weight in a professional setting, especially when the main issue is the treatment of the daughter? The author might be conflating their own frustration with Annie's parenting into a personal attack on Annie's weight. While the underlying concern is valid, the method used could be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions were driven by a desire to address the harm done to the daughter. However, the workplace isn't the appropriate setting for such confrontations, and the comment could be seen as a violation of professionalism. The author might not be \"in the wrong\" in terms of intent, but the execution of the comment could be considered unwise and unprofessional.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because the method used to address the issue was inappropriate, even if the concern was valid. However, there's a counterargument that the author was trying to highlight hypocrisy. But given the context of the workplace and the sensitive nature of body weight, the author's comment was likely inappropriate.\n"
