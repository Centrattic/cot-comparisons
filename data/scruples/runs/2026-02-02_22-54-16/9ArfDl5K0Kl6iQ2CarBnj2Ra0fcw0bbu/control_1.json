However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nAnnie's daughter was forced into a weight loss program by Annie. The program involved giving up college funds, strict dieting, and the daughter lost a lot of weight, becoming underweight. The author called Child Protective Services, which didn't result in any action. Then, the author confronts Annie at work by implying that the program might work for her too, pointing out the hypocrisy since Annie is overweight. Annie took the money from the program, and the daughter is now facing financial issues because of it.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to address Annie's harmful behavior towards her daughter. The author was concerned about the daughter's health and well-being, which is understandable. However, the method used was a sarcastic comment implying Annie should also join the program. The author didn't directly confront Annie about the daughter's situation but used a veiled threat or comment.\n\nIn terms of ethics, is it right to confront someone about their behavior, especially when that behavior affects a minor? The author did contact CPS, which is appropriate, but perhaps the follow-up was not effective. However, the comment at work might be seen as a form of retaliation or public shaming. Even if the author's intent was to highlight the hypocrisy, making a comment that could be interpreted as mocking someone's weight might not be the best approach.\n\nWeight is a sensitive topic, and making a comment about someone's weight in the workplace, even indirectly, could be considered unprofessional or discriminatory. The author's comment might be seen as a form of body shaming, regardless of the context. Even if the comment was meant to make a point about Annie's actions, it's possible that the author crossed a line by targeting Annie's weight instead of addressing the issue directly.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to address a serious situation where a minor's health was compromised. The author's actions were motivated by concern for the daughter's well-being. However, the method chosen was not the most effective or appropriate. Instead of directly addressing Annie or the employer about the situation, the author chose to make a passive-aggressive comment during work time, which might not have been the best approach.\n\nWorkplace dynamics also matter here. The author's coworker, Annie, is in a position where her actions (forcing her daughter into a harmful program) are a family matter, but the author is now retaliating in a professional setting. This could affect workplace relationships and create a hostile environment. The author's regret suggests they realize the comment might have been inappropriate, even if the underlying concern was valid.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's comment was a reaction to a serious issue but was delivered in a way that could be seen as unprofessional and potentially discriminatory. Even though the intent was to highlight hypocrisy, the method was not appropriate. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
