However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet. The situation involves the coworker, Annie, who forced her daughter into a harmful weight loss program. The author, upset by this, made a sarcastic comment implying Annie should try the same program.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author's coworker was abusive by taking money intended for college and making the daughter starve, leading to health issues. The author intervened by calling CPS when they noticed the daughter's condition. Then, when Annie bragged about her daughter's success, the author made a comment suggesting she should do the same. \n\nThe key points here are the author's intent and the context. The author was trying to hold Annie accountable for her actions, pointing out the hypocrisy of her not following the same diet. However, making a comment about someone's weight, even in the context of their abusive behavior, can be sensitive. The comment might be seen as crossing a line, especially since weight is a personal and often sensitive topic. \n\nOn one hand, the author had valid concerns and tried to help the daughter. On the other hand, the comment could be seen as shaming, which might not be the best approach, even if the intention was to highlight hypocrisy. The author might have a point in wanting Annie to address her own weight, but the method used was indirect and potentially unkind. \n\nAlso, considering the outcome: Annie didn't respond, and the daughter hasn't returned. The author regrets the comment but feels justified. The question is whether the author overstepped. In professional settings, discussing weight can be discriminatory, especially if it's not relevant to work. Even with good intentions, the comment might be inappropriate. \n\nSo, while the author's actions were motivated by concern for the coworker's daughter, the method of addressing the issue could be seen as unprofessional and shaming. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for making such a comment publicly, even if the underlying issue was serious.\n"
