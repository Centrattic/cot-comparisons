However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their coworker to go on a diet, based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The coworker, Annie, made her daughter go on a strict diet program, even though the daughter was healthy. The daughter had multiple activities and was actually a good student. The program led the daughter to become severely underweight and injured, and the mother took the money. The author, concerned, called CPS, which didn't result in action. Then the author snapped at Annie by suggesting she should try the same program, implying she's overweight. The coworker didn't react further, and the author is unsure if they were right to do that.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's motivation was concern for a vulnerable person, the coworker's harmful actions towards her daughter, and the author's response. The question is whether the author's comment was appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, the author had a valid concern and took action by calling CPS. Then, when the authorities didn't act, they tried to address the situation directly. However, the method was to publicly imply that Annie should also lose weight. This involves body-shaming, which is generally not acceptable. Even if the intention was to highlight hypocrisy, using a comment about someone's weight to criticize their behavior is problematic. It's possible that the author's comment could be seen as cruel, regardless of intent.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker's actions were definitely harmful. The daughter was forced into an extreme diet, leading to her being underweight and in poor health. The author's comment might have been a way to call out Annie's actions, but the approach was not constructive. The author could have tried other methods, like speaking to HR or management if they had the authority, or perhaps supporting the daughter more directly instead of making a cutting remark.\n\nIn terms of ethics, even if the coworker was wrong, retaliating with a personal attack on the author's body image might not be the right approach. The comment could have been hurtful and unprofessional, even if well-intentioned. So, the author might be in the wrong because their method of addressing the issue was inappropriate, despite the underlying concern being valid.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the method used was body-shaming, which is not an acceptable way to address someone's harmful behavior, even if the intent was good.\n"
