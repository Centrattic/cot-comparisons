However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet. The situation involves Annie forcing her daughter to lose weight through a questionable program, and the author called out Annie using the same program.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. Annie's actions towards her daughter are concerning. She used her daughter's money for a diet program that sounds unhealthy. The daughter ended up underweight and in bad health. The author, seeing this, contacted CPS, which is a responsible action. Then, when Annie boasted about the results, the author made a comment implying Annie should do the same. The author didn't directly mention Annie's weight but the implication was there.\n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. The main point is the comment made to Annie. The author was responding to Annie's harmful behavior. However, making a passive-aggressive comment about someone's weight, even if motivated by concern, can be seen as judgmental. The author's intention was to highlight the hypocrisy, but the method might have been inappropriate.\n\nAlso, the author did the right thing by reporting to CPS when they noticed the daughter's condition. That shows concern. However, after that, the comment to Annie might not be the best approach. The author could have focused on the daughter's well-being without addressing Annie's weight directly. The comment could be seen as crossing a line, even if the author's intent was to call out the hypocrisy.\n\nIn terms of workplace dynamics, making such a comment could be unprofessional. It's possible that the author overstepped by addressing personal matters in a public or work setting. However, the underlying issue of the daughter's treatment is serious. The author's actions were in response to a harmful situation, but the method might not be the most effective or appropriate.\n\nSo, the author's intent was partly good (trying to address the issue), but the approach could be problematic. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the passive-aggressive comment towards Annie's weight, even if the concern was valid. Alternatively, some might argue the author was justified given Annie's actions, but the way it was handled might still be wrong.\n\nI think the key here is that the author made a comment that could be seen as shaming Annie over her weight, which is generally not acceptable regardless of the circumstances. So, Answer A.\n"
