However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" question is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker, Annie, who forced her daughter into a harmful weight loss program. The author, upon witnessing the daughter's suffering and Annie's actions, made a snide comment implying Annie should also go on the diet.\n\nFirst, I need to assess Annie's actions. She took her daughter's money, forced her into a program that led to the daughter becoming underweight and injured. That's clearly harmful and possibly abusive. The author's intention was to confront Annie about her hypocrisy, but the method was passive-aggressive. The author didn't directly address the issue to authorities or support the daughter beyond calling CPS, which didn't result in action. Then, instead of confronting Annie directly about her daughter's situation, the author made a veiled insult about Annie's own weight. \n\nThe key question is whether the author's response was justified. While Annie's actions were wrong, the author's retaliation by insinuating weight loss on Annie might not be the best approach. It's possible that the comment was a form of passive-aggressive retaliation rather than constructive intervention. However, the author's motivation was to highlight the hypocrisy and potentially encourage Annie to address her own health. \n\nBut, considering the potential harm: the comment could be seen as bullying or making a personal attack, which might not be effective and could damage workplace relationships. The author's primary responsibility might have been to support the daughter or take more direct action, but they didn't do that. Instead, they opted for a snide remark. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author did act out of concern for the daughter's well-being, but the method was inappropriate. The author could have escalated the issue further through proper channels or supported the daughter more directly. The comment, while perhaps intended as a wake-up call, was a personal jab that might not address the root problem. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not handling the situation more constructively and for making a personal attack instead of addressing the issue directly.\n"
