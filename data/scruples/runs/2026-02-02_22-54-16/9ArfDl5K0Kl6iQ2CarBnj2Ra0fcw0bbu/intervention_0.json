However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for commenting on their coworker's weight after the coworker, Annie, forced her daughter into an extreme dieting program.\n\nFirst, Annie's actions towards her daughter are questionable. She used her daughter's college funds for a weight loss program, which sounds like a scam. The daughter ended up underweight and injured, and the program didn't provide proper nutrition. The author called CPS, but nothing came of it. That shows the author tried to help the daughter first, which is commendable.\n\nNow, the author's response to Annie was to suggest that Annie should try the same program. The author didn't directly accuse Annie of being overweight but implied it. The question is whether this comment was justified. The author was angry because Annie didn't apply the same program to herself, which seems hypocritical. However, the author's intention was to point out the hypocrisy, not to bully Annie.\n\nBut is that the right approach? Telling someone to go on a diet can be seen as personal and potentially offensive, even if there's a valid reason. The author might have thought that by highlighting the double standard, they were encouraging Annie to address her own weight issues. However, the method could be seen as passive-aggressive or even cruel, especially given the context of Annie's harmful behavior towards her daughter.\n\nOn one hand, the author was trying to help the daughter by holding Annie accountable. On the other, the comment might have been a form of retaliation rather than a constructive approach. The author did report to CPS, which is the right step, but the comment might not have been the best way to handle it. Also, the author's own actions in the office could come off as unprofessional or judgmental.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the main issue is whether pointing out someone's weight in a sarcastic way is the right approach. Even if the intent is good, the impact can be negative. The author might have crossed a line by making a personal comment in the workplace, especially since it's a sensitive topic. However, considering the harmful actions of Annie towards her daughter, the author's comment could be seen as a justified response to hypocrisy.\n\nBut legally and ethically, the author might still be in the wrong because the comment is about personal appearance and could foster a hostile work environment. Even if the intent was noble, the method isn't appropriate. The right action would have been to continue advocating for the daughter and advising Annie through proper channels rather than making a personal jab.\n\nSo, weighing all factors, the author did act out of concern but chose an inappropriate method. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
