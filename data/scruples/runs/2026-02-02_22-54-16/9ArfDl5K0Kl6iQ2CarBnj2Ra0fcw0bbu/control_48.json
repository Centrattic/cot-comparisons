However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their coworker, Annie, to go on a diet. The situation involves Annie forcing her daughter into an extreme diet program, which the author found troubling and led to reporting it to CPS. Then, when Annie boasted about her daughter's weight loss, the author made a comment implying Annie should try the same program.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is with Annie's actions toward her daughter. The author called CPS because they were concerned about the daughter's health and well-being. That seems like a responsible action, as the daughter was severely underweight and in poor health. The author had valid concerns about child neglect or abuse here.\n\nNow, when Annie started boasting about the daughter's success, the author responded by suggesting Annie should do the same. The question is whether this was wrong. The author's comment was indirect but implied that Annie, who is overweight, should also lose weight. However, the underlying issue is that the author felt Annie was hypocritical for making her daughter go through an extreme diet without changing her own habits.\n\nBut is it the author's place to comment on Annie's weight? Even if the author had good intentions, making a comment about someone's body can be seen as personal and potentially hurtful. However, the context here is that Annie's actions toward her daughter were harmful. The author's comment might have been intended to highlight the hypocrisy, but it's still a judgment about Annie's weight, which is a sensitive topic.\n\nThe key factors here are the author's intent and the method used. The author was trying to address the hypocrisy but used a public comment that could be seen as shaming Annie. Even though the comment didn't explicitly call Annie out for her weight, the implication was clear. In a workplace, making such a comment could be considered unprofessional and might contribute to a hostile environment, regardless of the underlying concerns.\n\nAdditionally, the author had already taken appropriate action by contacting CPS. Making a personal comment about Annie's weight might not be the most effective or ethical way to address the issue, especially since the author isn't in a position to judge or comment on someone else's body. It's possible that the author's frustration led them to make a snap judgment, which isn't helpful.\n\nTherefore, while the author had valid concerns about the daughter's situation, the way they addressed Annie's own weight was inappropriate. The comment was a personal attack rather than a constructive approach. So, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong for making that comment, even if their intentions were to highlight the hypocrisy.\n"
