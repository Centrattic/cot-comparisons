However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet. The main issue here is the author's coworker, Annie, forcing her daughter to starve herself on a strict diet program, which led to the daughter becoming underweight and harming herself. The author, after trying to report this to CPS without success, snaps at Annie by suggesting she should do the same program since she's overweight. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Annie's actions towards her daughter are definitely concerning and potentially abusive. The author tried to take action by calling CPS, which didn't result in any intervention. The author's frustration is understandable given the situation. However, the author's response was to publicly imply that Annie should also go on a diet, which is a direct comment about Annie's weight. \n\nEven though the comment was a subtle jab, it's important to note that the author's intention was to highlight the hypocrisy of Annie, who made her daughter go through a harmful diet while she herself is overweight. However, making a comment about someone's weight, even in response to their abusive behavior, can be seen as crossing a line. Weight is a sensitive topic, and public shaming or implied criticism can be hurtful and unproductive. \n\nThe author might argue that their intent was to protect the daughter and hold Annie accountable, but the method of responding by targeting Annie's own weight could be viewed as mean-spirited or retaliatory. The key here is whether the author's comment was a proportionate and appropriate way to address the issue. Since the author had already taken steps by calling CPS, maybe a direct conversation with Annie or involving other authorities would have been better. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author felt that the system (CPS) didn't help, they might have felt powerless and used the only means available to them. But even so, making a comment in a work setting about someone's weight could be seen as unprofessional and potentially discriminatory, depending on the workplace culture.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's primary concern was to address the harm Annie was causing her daughter, which is commendable. However, the method they chose to do so may not be the right approach. It's possible that the author is in the wrong because they targeted Annie's weight instead of addressing the issue through more constructive or professional channels. \n\nAnother angle is the potential impact on the author's relationship with Annie and the workplace environment. Publicly implying someone should lose weight can create a hostile work environment, especially if weight is a protected class in their area. Even if the author's intent was good, the action could be considered unprofessional or even discriminatory. \n\nConsidering all these factors, while the author's intention was to help the daughter and hold Annie accountable, the method of using a comment about Annie's weight might not be the appropriate way to handle it. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for their approach, even if the underlying issue is serious.\n"
