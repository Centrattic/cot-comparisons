However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet. The context is that the coworker, Annie, forced her daughter into a harmful weight loss program, which led to the daughter becoming underweight and experiencing health issues. The author, after witnessing this, made a sarcastic comment implying Annie should join the same program.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Annie's actions towards her daughter are clearly problematic. She took her daughter's money, possibly without consent, and subjected her to an extreme diet, leading to the daughter's health decline. The author felt compelled to respond, which raises questions about the appropriateness of their approach.\n\nThe author's comment was a public jab, using Annie's own program against her. While the author might have been trying to highlight the hypocrisy, the method was confrontational. However, given the severity of Annie's actions, the author might feel justified. But is it right to respond in such a way in a professional setting?\n\nWorkplace ethics usually advise against personal attacks, even if the intent is to correct someone's behavior. The author's comment could be seen as unprofessional and potentially discriminatory if based on weight. But there's also the argument that the author was trying to protect the coworker's daughter, which adds a layer of moral responsibility.\n\nAnother angle is the effectiveness of the action. The author's comment might have made Annie stop, but it's unclear if it led to any positive change. The daughter hasn't returned, and Annie hasn't addressed it. The author regrets the comment but also feels anger towards Annie's actions.\n\nLegal and ethical guidelines don't condone public shaming, but they also don't condone harmful behavior towards minors. The author took action after contacting CPS, which didn't resolve the issue. The comment was a follow-up, perhaps feeling that other avenues were exhausted.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's intent was to address a harmful situation, but the method chosen could be seen as inappropriate. However, the alternative of doing nothing might be worse. The key is whether the author's action was a reasonable response given the context.\n\nConsidering all factors, the answer hinges on balancing the severity of Annie's actions against the method the author used. The author's comment, while unkind, was a response to witnessing abuse. However, in a professional setting, such a personal attack isn't typically advised. But given the circumstances, there's a strong argument that the author was trying to correct a harmful behavior, even if the approach was flawed. So, while the author isn't entirely in the right, the situation is complex. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. Given the intent to stop harm, perhaps the answer is B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that the method was inappropriate.\n"
