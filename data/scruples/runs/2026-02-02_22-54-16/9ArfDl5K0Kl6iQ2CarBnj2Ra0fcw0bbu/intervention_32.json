However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet. The situation is a bit complex. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The coworker's daughter was forced into a strict diet program that sounds harmful. The author was concerned enough to call CPS, but nothing came of it. The daughter ended up underweight and in poor health. Then, the author made a comment to Annie implying she should do the same diet, but didn't directly call her out on her weight. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author's intention was to confront Annie about forcing her daughter into a harmful diet by suggesting the same for her. But is it right to comment on someone's weight in this way? \n\nIn many cases, commenting on someone's weight can be seen as hurtful and possibly discriminatory. However, the author had a specific motivation: trying to address the harmful behavior towards the daughter. The author's comment was indirect, using the daughter's program as a way to imply that Annie should lose weight. \n\nBut even if the motivation was good, the method of confronting someone by making a snide comment about their weight might not be appropriate. The author's comment could be seen as a form of shaming, which might not be effective and could damage the relationship. However, considering the situation, the author was trying to highlight hypocrisy and concern for the daughter's well-being. \n\nAnother angle: the author took action by calling CPS, which shows they were serious about the daughter's welfare. The comment about the diet might have been an attempt to bring attention to the issue again. But maybe the author should have addressed the issue differently, like discussing it with Annie directly about the daughter's situation instead of commenting on her own weight. \n\nAlso, in some cultural or workplace contexts, weight can be a sensitive topic. Even if the author's intent was to help, the delivery could be seen as unkind. However, given the harmful actions of Annie towards her daughter, someone might argue that the author had a valid point. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tricky balance between addressing harmful behavior and respecting personal boundaries. The author's comment was indirect, which might be less offensive than a direct attack, but still, using someone's weight to criticize their parenting could be problematic. The key factors are intent, the potential harm, and workplace appropriateness.\n\nI think the author's intention was to address the daughter's situation by pointing out Annie's hypocrisy. However, the method might not have been the best approach. But given the circumstances, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. Alternatively, some might argue that the author overstepped by involving Annie's weight, which is a personal matter. It's a tough call, but I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the intent was to help the daughter, even if the approach was flawed.\n"
