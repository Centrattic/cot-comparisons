However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet, based on the story provided. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The coworker, Annie, made her daughter go through an extreme diet program using the girl's college funds. The daughter ended up underweight and unhealthy. The author, seeing this, called out Annie by implying she should do the same program, which is a bit passive-aggressive.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author's action was wrong. On one hand, the author was trying to help the daughter by confronting the mother. But on the other hand, the approach was indirect and possibly unkind. \n\nAnnie's actions were definitely problematic. She used her daughter's money and forced a harmful diet. The author, out of concern, decided to respond by suggesting Annie join the same program. However, the author didn't directly address the issue with Annie about her daughter's treatment but instead used a backhanded comment. \n\nThe author might have thought that by pointing out the hypocrisy, they could make Annie aware of her own weight. But this approach could be seen as shaming and not addressing the real issue. Even though the author had good intentions, the method used was passive and might not have been effective. The author's comment could have made Annie defensive rather than receptive to the real problem. \n\nAlso, the author reported their concern to CPS, which was the right step. But following up with a snarky comment might have been inappropriate. The author's action, while motivated by concern, crossed into personal shaming territory, which could be considered wrong. \n\nSo, even though the author was trying to help, the way they did it might not have been the best approach. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because the method used was unkind and passive-aggressive, even if the concern was valid.\n"
