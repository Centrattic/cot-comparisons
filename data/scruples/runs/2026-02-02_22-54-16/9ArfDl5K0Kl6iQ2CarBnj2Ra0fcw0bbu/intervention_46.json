However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the first post (AITA) is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is a coworker of Annie, who is described as overweight. Annie's daughter was involved in a strict weight loss program that the author found concerning. The daughter ended up underweight and injured, and the author reported the situation to CPS, which didn't result in action. Then, when Annie boasted about the program's success, the author commented on it in a way that implied Annie should also join the program. The author is now unsure if they were right to make that comment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author's main motivation was concern for Annie's daughter's well-being. They noticed the daughter becoming more sickly and even resorted to calling CPS. The author's action of reporting was a responsible step. However, when the CPS didn't take action, the author felt compelled to address the issue in another way.\n\nNow, the key point is the author's comment to Annie. The author didn't explicitly call Annie out for being overweight but made a veiled comment implying that Annie should also use the program. The question is whether this comment was appropriate. \n\nOn one hand, the author was justified in their concern for the daughter's health. They had a moral obligation to act when they noticed signs of abuse or neglect. On the other hand, directing a comment at Annie's weight, even indirectly, could be seen as crossing a line. The author might have assumed that Annie was in need of losing weight, which is a personal choice and not a direct consequence of her actions towards her daughter. \n\nHowever, the author's intention was to highlight the hypocrisy of Annie benefiting from a program that was harmful to her daughter without applying it to herself. The comment was a form of expressing frustration and pointing out the inconsistency. While it's important to address harmful behavior, doing so by making a jab at someone's weight could be considered unkind and possibly inappropriate, especially in a professional setting.\n\nBut considering the context, the author was trying to address an issue where they felt Annie wasn't taking responsibility for her actions. The comment was a response to Annie's boasting, which the author found hypocritical. The author might not be in the wrong because their primary concern was the daughter's well-being, and the comment was a reaction to Annie's behavior. However, there's a nuance here between addressing the issue directly versus taking a jab at the parent's weight.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author's actions were driven by a desire to help the daughter and hold Annie accountable. The comment, while possibly tactless, was a response to a situation where the author felt the system (CPS) didn't act. Therefore, the author's actions could be seen as justified under the circumstances, even if the method was not the most professional.\n"
