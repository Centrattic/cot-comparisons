However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet, based on the coworker forcing her daughter into an extreme diet.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The coworker, Annie, made her daughter participate in a restrictive diet program that led to the daughter becoming underweight and health issues. The author, upon witnessing this, confronted Annie by implying she should do the same diet, using the daughter's success as an example. The author is now concerned about being at fault.\n\nThe main question is whether the author's response was appropriate. The author's intention was to point out the hypocrisy of Annie not following the same diet herself. However, the approach was indirect and possibly passive-aggressive. Instead of addressing Annie's behavior towards her daughter directly, the author made a veiled comment about Annie's weight, which could be seen as cruel or insensitive.\n\nLegally and ethically, the author might be in a tricky spot. While the situation with Annie's daughter is concerning, the author's response of telling Annie to diet could be seen as crossing a line. The author's comment was public (at work) and used the daughter's experience to shame Annie about her own weight. This could be considered bullying or harassment, especially if it was done in a public setting. Even if the author's intention was to highlight the hypocrisy, using a passive-aggressive comment that focuses on body weight is generally not an effective or respectful way to address someone's behavior.\n\nAdditionally, the author had already contacted CPS, which is the appropriate action when there's suspicion of child neglect or abuse. After that, the author's next step should have been to perhaps support the daughter or let the authorities handle it. The comment about Annie's diet might have been an overreaction, especially since the author admitted to feeling angry and snapped. The comment didn't directly address Annie's behavior towards her daughter but instead focused on Annie's own weight, which is a separate issue and could be seen as a personal attack.\n\nIn terms of corporate policy, making comments about a coworker's weight in the workplace could lead to discrimination claims. Weight-based discrimination is illegal in some jurisdictions, and the author's comment could create a hostile work environment. Even if the author's intent was to criticize Annie's parenting, the method used was inappropriate and could reflect poorly on the author.\n\nHowever, the underlying issue is that Annie's actions were harmful to her daughter. The author was concerned and tried to help by involving CPS, which was the right step. But the subsequent comment about Annie's weight was not the right approach. The author might have wanted to point out the inconsistency in Annie's behavior but did so in a way that could be seen as cruel and unprofessional.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author had valid concerns about the daughter's welfare and took appropriate steps by contacting CPS, the method of confronting Annie by shaming her weight in the workplace was inappropriate and unprofessional. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for the way they handled the situation.\n"
