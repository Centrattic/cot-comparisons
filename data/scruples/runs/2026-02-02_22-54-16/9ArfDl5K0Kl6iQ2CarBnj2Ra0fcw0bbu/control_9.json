However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet. The key here is understanding the context provided.\n\nAnnie's daughter, who is in high school, was forced into a strict weight loss program by Annie. The program involved taking money from the daughter's college funds, leading to the daughter becoming severely underweight and unhealthy. The author, upon seeing the daughter's condition and Annie's role in it, felt compelled to confront Annie by suggesting she join the same program. The author didn't directly comment on Annie's weight but implied it through the suggestion, which Annie took as a jab.\n\nFirst, the author's intent was to address Annie's behavior towards her daughter. However, the method they chose was to publicly imply that Annie needed to lose weight. Even though the author had good intentions based on the daughter's suffering, using a sarcastic remark about the coworker's weight could be seen as crossing a line. Weight is a sensitive topic, and making a comment in a public work setting, even if implying a broader issue, can be considered unprofessional or hurtful.\n\nMoreover, the author's action might not have been the most effective way to address the serious issue of the daughter's well-being. Reporting to CPS was the correct step, but trying to address Annie's own weight through a veiled comment might not be the right approach. It's possible that the author's comment could have made Annie defensive, potentially making her less likely to change her behavior towards her daughter. Additionally, the author's action could be seen as hypocritical if Annie's weight isn't an immediate health risk, but the focus should be on the daughter's situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern for the daughter's welfare is valid, and they did take action by contacting CPS. However, using a public, indirect method to confront Annie about her weight might not be appropriate. The author's comment could be seen as a form of passive-aggressive behavior that doesn't address the root issue effectively and could harm workplace relationships.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's concern for the daughter is understandable, the method they used to address Annie's behavior was inappropriate. The direct issue was the daughter's welfare, not Annie's weight. The comment was a personal jab that might not contribute to solving the problem and could be seen as unkind and unprofessional. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
