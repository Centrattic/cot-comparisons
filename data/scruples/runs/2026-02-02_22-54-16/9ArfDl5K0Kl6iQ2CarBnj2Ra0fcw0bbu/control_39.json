However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet, referencing the coworker's harmful behavior towards her daughter. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The coworker, Annie, forced her daughter into a restrictive diet program using her college funds, leading the daughter to become underweight and injured. The author, witnessing this, called CPS, which didn't act, then confronted Annie by implying she should join the same program. The author regrets the comment but is angry at Annie's hypocrisy.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for making that comment. Let's break it down. \n\nAnnie's actions are clearly problematic. She took her daughter's money, forced her into a harmful diet, and ignored her health. The author acted out of concern, which is understandable. But the method of confronting Annie by insinuating she should diet because she's overweight is a bit tricky. \n\nIs it wrong to address someone's weight in this context? Weight-related comments can be sensitive and often touch on biases. Even if the author's intent was to highlight hypocrisy, using a snide comment about weight might not be the best approach. It's possible that the author's comment was a form of passive-aggressive retaliation rather than addressing the real issue directly. However, considering the serious nature of Annie's actions towards her daughter, the author's motivation was to draw attention to the problem. \n\nThe key factors here are intent and the appropriateness of the response. The author tried to confront Annie indirectly, which might not be the most effective method, but given the circumstances, it's a reaction to a harmful situation. However, making a comment about someone's weight, even if implying a connection to their behavior, can be seen as crossing a line, especially in a professional setting. \n\nThere's also the aspect of whether the author should have addressed the issue more directly with Annie or through other channels, like human resources or a supervisor, rather than making a snide remark. But the author did contact CPS, which is a responsible action. The comment to Annie might have been an emotional reaction after seeing the daughter suffer. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is trying to do the right thing by protecting the daughter, but the method might be questionable. However, the underlying issue is Annie's harm towards her child, which is more severe than a weight comment. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because their actions were motivated by concern for the daughter's well-being. The comment was a way to point out Annie's hypocrisy, even if it wasn't the most constructive approach. So, answer B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
