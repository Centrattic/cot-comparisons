However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author confronting their coworker, Annie, about her forcing her daughter into a harmful weight loss program. The author then tells Annie to start the program herself, implying she should do the same since she's overweight. \n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The coworker's daughter was underweight, injured, and the program was potentially unhealthy. The author felt compelled to act after seeing the daughter's condition. The author's comment was meant to highlight the hypocrisy of Annie not applying the same program to herself.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the author did take action after witnessing what they believed was harm to a minor. However, the method they used was a public jab, which might be seen as inappropriate or unprofessional. While the author's intentions were to help the daughter, directly calling out the mother in front of coworkers could be considered a breach of privacy or an unkind approach. The coworker might feel humiliated, and the author could have approached it differently, like involving authorities or talking to Annie privately. \n\nHowever, the coworker's actions as a parent were questionable, and the author's comment might have been a way to hold her accountable. But the line between standing up for someone and being unprofessional can be thin. The author's action could be seen as justified in trying to help the daughter but might be considered tactless or hypocritical if the author themselves is also overweight, though that's not stated. \n\nConsidering that the daughter was harmed and the author acted out of concern, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. But the approach was harsh and possibly unkind. So, there's a mix here. However, the main issue is the method used. Since the author's intent was to help, but the execution was problematic, maybe the answer leans towards \"No,\" the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to intervene in a harmful situation. However, others might argue the method was inappropriate. But given the serious nature of potential child abuse, the author's action, while unkind, was in response to a harmful situation. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
