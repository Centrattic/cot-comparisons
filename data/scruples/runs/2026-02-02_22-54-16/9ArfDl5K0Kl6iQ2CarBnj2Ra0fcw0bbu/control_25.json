However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet. The situation is complicated because the coworker, Annie, forced her daughter into a harmful weight loss program. The author felt compelled to snap at Annie by implying she should try the same program.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the ethical aspects here. The coworker's actions towards her daughter are definitely concerning. The daughter was underweight, injured herself, and lost money meant for college. The author was worried and called CPS, but nothing came of it. The author then made a comment to Annie that might have been a passive-aggressive way of pointing out the hypocrisy.\n\nNow, the author's action was to suggest Annie start the program herself. Even though the comment was indirect, it's about body shaming. Weight is a sensitive topic, and making a comment about someone's weight, even as a reaction to their harmful behavior, could be seen as crossing a line. The author regrets the comment but still feels it was justified due to Annie's actions.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to address a real issue with Annie's behavior towards her daughter. On the other hand, the method used\u2014using the daughter's situation to imply the mother is also overweight\u2014might be seen as inconsiderate. The author didn't directly confront the harmful actions but instead focused on the mother's weight, which could be viewed as a personal attack rather than addressing the actual problem.\n\nAlso, the author's comment didn't directly address Annie's behavior towards her daughter, which might be more effective. Instead, they used a veiled threat about their own weight, which could come off as bullying or hypocrisy. The coworker might feel attacked and withdraw, which happened as Annie stopped talking to the author and her daughter hasn't come back.\n\nLegally, maybe the author is within their rights to express concern, but ethically, the method might be questionable. The author's intention was to highlight the hypocrisy, but the approach could be seen as mean-spirited. The question is whether the comment was a justified response or if it was inconsiderate and crossed into bullying territory.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author had valid concerns about Annie's actions towards her daughter, the way they addressed it by making a passive-aggressive comment about Annie's weight is likely where they went wrong. The focus on the mother's weight rather than the daughter's treatment may not be the most effective or ethical approach, making the author at least partially in the wrong.\n"
