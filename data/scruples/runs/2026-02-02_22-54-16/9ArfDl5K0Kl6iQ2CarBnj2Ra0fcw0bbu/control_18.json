However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after telling their overweight coworker Annie to go on a diet. The context is that Annie forced her daughter into a strict diet program that led the daughter to become severely underweight. The author, upset about this, confronted Annie with a comment implying she should also start the program, which made Annie stop mentioning it and the daughter hasn't come back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Annie's actions towards her daughter are concerning. Forcing a teenager into a restrictive diet, taking her college money, and leading to health issues seems abusive. The author's intention was likely to call out Annie's hypocrisy, as Annie was happy with her daughter's weight loss but didn't address her own weight. The author felt they had to act after seeing the daughter's deterioration, which is understandable in terms of concern for a minor's well-being.\n\nHowever, the method used was a public comment that may have been passive-aggressive. The author didn't directly address the issue in a constructive way but instead made a snide remark. While the intent was to highlight hypocrisy, the approach might have been inappropriate. The author's comment could be seen as personal and judgmental, even if it was meant to provoke change. \n\nBut given the context of potential child abuse, the author's actions might be justified as a form of intervention, albeit not the most effective. However, the author could have reported the situation to authorities instead of making a personal comment. The key here is whether the author's comment crossed the line into personal harassment or if it was a necessary intervention to protect the daughter. The answer likely leans towards the author being in the right because of the severity of the situation, but there's a nuance in the method of confrontation. But since the options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong), and considering the underlying child welfare issue, the answer is probably B.\n"
