However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their coworker, Annie, to go on a diet. The situation involves Annie's daughter being forced into a harmful diet program. \n\nFirst, the author saw that Annie's daughter was being pressured to lose weight through an extreme diet, which led to health issues and financial loss. The author called CPS, which didn't result in action. Then, when Annie boasted about her daughter's weight loss, the author implied Annie should do the same, which was a veiled comment about her weight.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. The key points are: the author's coworker (Annie) was mistreating her daughter, and the author took action by reporting and then making a comment. \n\nOn one hand, the author had a legitimate concern about the daughter's well-being and tried to help by calling CPS. The comment was a way to hold Annie accountable for her actions. But on the other hand, the author's approach could be seen as crossing a line by targeting Annie's weight, which is personal and might not be the best way to address the issue. \n\nHowever, the main issue is the harm done to the daughter. The author's comment was a response to Annie's harmful behavior. Even if the comment was harsh, it might be seen as a reaction to the bigger problem of child abuse. The author's intention was to confront Annie's hypocrisy, not just her weight. \n\nBut is it appropriate to make a comment about someone's weight in the workplace? It's generally considered a sensitive topic and can be seen as bullying or discriminatory. However, in this context, the author's action was a response to a serious issue. \n\nThe answer might depend on whether the comment was a reasonable response given the circumstances. Since the author was trying to highlight the hypocrisy and the main issue was the daughter's treatment, the comment might be justified. However, the method of addressing it could be questioned. \n\nBut since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, considering the broader context of the daughter's abuse, it's possible that the author is not in the wrong because they were trying to address a harmful situation, even if their approach was not ideal. So the answer might lean towards B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
