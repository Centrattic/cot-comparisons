However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet. The coworker, Annie, forced her daughter to lose a significant amount of weight using a program that sounds unhealthy, even leading to the daughter becoming underweight and injured. The author, after calling Child Protective Services (CPS) without success, confronts Annie by implying she should join the same program, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, the key elements here are the author's intent and the method used. The author's motivation was to address Annie's harmful behavior towards her daughter. The author felt compelled to act after CPS didn't take action. The comment made was indirect, using the success of the program on the daughter as a reason for Annie to consider it herself. The author didn't directly accuse Annie of being overweight but made the implication clear.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The author's main issue is with Annie's parenting and the harm done to her daughter. The author's comment was a form of retaliation or a way to highlight the hypocrisy in Annie's actions. The author's action was meant to hold Annie accountable, given that the direct approach (calling CPS) didn't result in intervention. However, the author did make a pointed comment in a public setting (workplace), which could be seen as unprofessional or crossing a line, even if the intent was good.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions were in response to observing and reporting abuse. The comment was a form of indirect confrontation, which might not be the best approach but doesn't necessarily make the author in the wrong. The author's intent was to support the daughter and address the parent's harmful behavior. The fact that the author regretted the comment after the fact shows some self-awareness, but the situation was dire given the daughter's health.\n\nHowever, the author could have taken other approaches, like encouraging the daughter to seek help or consulting with a supervisor about the situation. Publicly implying that Annie should lose weight, while not directly abusive, could be seen as a personal attack, especially since the author has the authority to make such a comment in the workplace. It's a sensitive topic, and even if the intent was good, the method might not have been appropriate.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's concern for the daughter is valid and their actions were motivated by a desire to stop the harm, the way they addressed it might be considered inappropriate. However, given the lack of success in the previous efforts (CPS), the author might feel justified. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but there's a nuance here between intent and method.\n"
