However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet. The situation involves Annie's daughter being forced into a harmful weight loss program, which the author found concerning and reported to CPS. Now, the author is wondering if their comment to Annie about joining the same program was appropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The author's coworker, Annie, subjected her daughter to an extreme diet that led to the daughter becoming severely underweight and harming herself. The author took action by calling CPS, which didn't result in any intervention. Then, the author made a comment to Annie implying that she should join the same program. The key issue here is whether the author's comment was a justified response or crossing a line.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is upset about Annie's behavior towards her daughter. The comment was meant to hold Annie accountable for her actions by pointing out the hypocrisy of making her daughter diet while she remains overweight. However, the approach might be seen as confrontational or passive-aggressive. The author didn't directly confront Annie about the daughter's treatment but instead used the situation to imply she should diet herself. This could be seen as using a personal attack rather than addressing the underlying issue directly.\n\nLegally, the author's action of calling CPS was appropriate if they genuinely believed there was child endangerment. However, the subsequent comment might be problematic in a workplace setting. Publicly or even privately making such a comment could be seen as a form of harassment or creating a hostile work environment, especially if it's based on someone's weight. Weight is a sensitive topic and can touch on issues of discrimination or bullying.\n\nEthically, while the author's intentions were to address a harmful situation, the method used was indirect and could be hurtful. The comment might not effectively address the root problem of Annie's behavior towards her daughter. Instead, it could lead to resentment and potentially damage the workplace relationship without resolving the issue.\n\nIn terms of workplace dynamics, the author's comment might not be the best approach. If the author is concerned about Annie's daughter's well-being, perhaps a more constructive approach would be to continue reporting the situation through appropriate channels rather than making a personal jab. The comment could be seen as crossing the line from concern to personal criticism, especially if it's based on someone's physical appearance.\n\nAdditionally, the author's comment could be viewed as a form of shaming, which is generally not effective in changing behavior and can lead to defensiveness. The comment might have been intended to make Annie reflect on her actions, but it's more likely to cause her to feel attacked rather than inspired to change.\n\nConsidering all these factors, while the author's concern for the daughter is valid, the method of addressing it by commenting on Annie's weight is problematic. The author might be in the wrong for using a personal and potentially hurtful approach rather than focusing on the child's well-being through appropriate channels.\n"
