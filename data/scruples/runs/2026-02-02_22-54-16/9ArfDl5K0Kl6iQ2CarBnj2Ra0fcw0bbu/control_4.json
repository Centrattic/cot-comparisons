However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet. The situation involves Annie forcing her daughter to undergo an extreme dieting program, which led to the daughter becoming underweight and health issues. The coworker, the author, felt compelled to confront Annie by implying she should join the same program, leading to a strained relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author's main issue is with Annie's treatment of her daughter. They took action by calling Child Protective Services, which didn't result in intervention. Then, the author confronted Annie publicly, using the same program Annie used on her daughter. The question is whether this confrontation was justified or if the author overstepped.\n\nAnnie's actions are questionable. Forcing a teenager in sports and academics to starve herself for weight loss is harmful, especially when the daughter's health is visibly deteriorating. The author's concern is valid, but their method of addressing it\u2014publicly shaming Annie\u2014might be problematic. Even if the author's intent was to hold Annie accountable, the approach could be seen as bullying or using Annie's weight as a weapon, which is a sensitive issue. Weight shaming can perpetuate stigma and doesn't address the root problem constructively.\n\nThe author's comment was indirect but implied criticism of Annie's weight. While the author might feel justified in wanting to protect the daughter, the method could have been more private and supportive. Public confrontation without addressing the actual abuse (the forced diet on the daughter) might not be effective and could alienate the coworker, making Annie less likely to change her behavior or seek help.\n\nAdditionally, the author's comment might not have resolved the daughter's situation. The daughter's fear about loans and her health issues weren't directly addressed. The author's action might have been a momentary reaction driven by anger rather than a constructive solution. The fact that Annie hasn't spoken to the author since could mean she's hurt or defensive, which isn't helpful for any resolution.\n\nConsidering all this, while Annie's actions are concerning, the author's response, though well-meaning, was a form of retaliation that could be seen as inconsiderate and perpetuating the same kind of harmful behavior\u2014using weight as a point of judgment. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for their approach, even if their intentions were to help the daughter.\n"
