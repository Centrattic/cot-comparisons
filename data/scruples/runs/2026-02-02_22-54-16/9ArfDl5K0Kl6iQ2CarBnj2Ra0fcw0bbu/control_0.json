However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet. The coworker, Annie, forced her daughter into an extreme diet program that led to the daughter becoming underweight and harming herself. The author, upset about this, made a comment implying Annie should join the program herself.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The key points are that Annie's actions towards her daughter are questionable. The daughter was forced to give up her college funds for a restrictive diet, leading to health issues. The author, after witnessing this, confronted Annie by suggesting she should try the same program. The author didn't directly say \"you're overweight,\" but the implication was clear.\n\nThe main question is whether the author's response was justified. On one hand, Annie's behavior is concerning and possibly abusive. The author tried to help by involving CPS, which didn't result in action. Then, the author's comment was a way to hold Annie accountable for her own weight issues, given her daughter's situation. However, the author's approach might be seen as passive-aggressive and possibly unprofessional. Direct confrontation or involving authorities might have been better steps. \n\nBut the author's intent was to address the hypocrisy of Annie enforcing the diet on her daughter without doing it herself. The comment might be seen as a form of indirect criticism, which could be justified given the severity of the situation. However, the author's method of addressing it through a veiled insult could be problematic. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while Annie's actions are wrong, the author's response might not be the most effective or appropriate. The author might have overstepped by making a snide remark instead of seeking further intervention. But given the context of Annie's harmful behavior, the author's frustration is understandable. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions were a reasonable response to the situation. Considering the potential for harm in Annie's actions and the author's intent to highlight this hypocrisy, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. However, the method used was passive-aggressive, which is unprofessional, but the situation's severity could mitigate that.\n"
