However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet, based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The coworker, Annie, forced her daughter to go on an extreme diet that led to the daughter being underweight and harming herself. The author, who witnessed this, called CPS, but nothing came of it. Then, when Annie boasted about her daughter's weight loss, the author made a comment implying she should do the same program herself. Now they're asking if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the main points here are: Annie's actions towards her daughter are questionable and possibly abusive. The author intervened by calling CPS, which is a responsible action. Then, when Annie boasted, the author made a sarcastic comment about her joining the program. \n\nThe key issue is whether the author's comment was appropriate. The author's intention was to point out Annie's hypocrisy\u2014using a program on her daughter but not herself. However, commenting on someone's weight can be sensitive. Even if the author's intent was to highlight Annie's behavior, the method might be seen as crossing a line. Publicly implying someone should lose weight, even indirectly, can be hurtful and is often considered a personal attack, regardless of the reason.\n\nAlso, the author admits they regretted the comment and that Annie hasn't spoken to them since. This suggests that the comment might have been a harsh reaction. However, considering the context of Annie's abusive behavior towards her daughter, the author's frustration is understandable. \n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, the question is whether the author's action (the comment) was justified. While the author had good intentions, the method of addressing Annie's behavior by making a personal comment about her weight might not be the best approach. It's possible that the author, while trying to highlight the hypocrisy, used a method that could be seen as attacking Annie instead of addressing the root issue.\n\nHowever, given the severity of Annie's actions towards her daughter, and the fact that the author tried to intervene through CPS, maybe the comment was a justified expression of anger. But in terms of workplace interactions, making a sarcastic comment about someone's weight could still be seen as unprofessional, even if the underlying concern is valid.\n\nSo, balancing these factors, the answer might depend on whether the comment was an appropriate response. Since the author's action was a personal jab rather than a constructive approach, they might be in the wrong. But if the intent was to hold Annie accountable for her actions, it's a bit more nuanced. However, the act of publicly implying someone should lose weight is generally not acceptable, regardless of the reason. Hence, the author might be in the wrong despite their intentions.\n"
