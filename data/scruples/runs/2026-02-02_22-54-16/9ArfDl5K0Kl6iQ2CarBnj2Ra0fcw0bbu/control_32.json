However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet, specifically referencing the coworker's harmful actions toward her daughter. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The coworker, Annie, forced her daughter into a dangerous diet program, taking her college funds. The author, concerned about the daughter's health, contacted CPS, which didn't lead to action. Then, the author confronted Annie by implying she should do the same diet, which Annie found amusing. Now, the author is wondering if they were wrong.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intent and the method used. The author's motivation was to address the hypocrisy they observed\u2014Annie making her daughter lose weight while she herself is overweight. However, the way they addressed it was indirect, using a sarcastic comment that implied Annie should also diet. The author didn't directly confront Annie about the harmful behavior towards her daughter but instead focused on the author's own issue with Annie's weight.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, making a passive-aggressive comment that could be seen as body-shaming is generally considered inappropriate. Even if the author had good intentions, the approach could be hurtful and doesn't address the real issue of the daughter's treatment. The author should have focused on supporting the daughter or escalating the matter through proper channels if CPS didn't act. Instead, they took it out on Annie in a way that's more about their own feelings than helping the daughter.\n\nAlso, body-shaming is usually frowned upon, regardless of the circumstances. While Annie's actions were harmful, the author's response might not be the most effective or ethical way to address it. They might have intended to highlight the hypocrisy, but the method was inappropriate. The author's responsibility is to advocate for the daughter's well-being, not to retaliate against Annie in a personal way.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's comment was probably inconsiderate and not the best approach. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong for making the comment, even if their intentions were to address a serious issue.\n"
