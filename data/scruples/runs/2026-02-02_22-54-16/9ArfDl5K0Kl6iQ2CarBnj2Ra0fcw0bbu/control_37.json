However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet. The situation is a bit complex because it's not just about a direct comment but the context in which it was made.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The coworker, Annie, forced her daughter into a restrictive diet program that led the daughter to become severely underweight. The author found out about this through Annie's boasting and then decided to confront her by suggesting she should try the same program. The author didn't explicitly say Annie is overweight but implied it. Now, they're asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here: Annie's actions towards her daughter are questionable, maybe even abusive. The author tried to help by calling CPS, which didn't result in action. Then, the author's response was to make a sarcastic comment implying Annie should diet. The author is conflicted, feeling angry but also regretful.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, directly confronting someone about their weight can be problematic, but the context here is that the author is reacting to Annie's harmful behavior towards her daughter. The author's intention might have been to highlight the hypocrisy or to make Annie reflect on her actions. However, the method used (a comment that targets the mother's weight) might be seen as shaming, which is generally not advisable.\n\nBut wait, the author didn't directly attack Annie's weight; they used the example of the daughter's program to imply that Annie should consider it. The comment was indirect, relying on the implication. However, even indirect comments about someone's body can be hurtful and may not be the best way to address the underlying issue. The author's main issue is with Annie's parenting, but they directed their frustration towards the mother's weight, which might not be the most effective or appropriate approach.\n\nAlso, considering the outcome: Annie hasn't spoken to the author since, and the daughter hasn't returned to the office. This could mean that the comment had unintended consequences, possibly damaging their relationship. The author's intention was to address the daughter's welfare, but their method of confronting Annie might have backfired or was unprofessional.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, even if the author's intention was to help, the method of addressing the issue by making a potentially shaming comment could be seen as wrong. It's important to address harmful behavior without resorting to personal attacks, even if they're implied. The author could have approached it differently, maybe by discussing the daughter's situation with Annie in a more constructive way or seeking further intervention through proper channels if CPS didn't act.\n\nIn summary, while the author's concern about Annie's daughter is valid, the way they chose to address it by implying a diet for Annie might be considered inappropriate or unkind, even if it was meant to highlight the mother's hypocrisy. So, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong), but there's nuance here because the underlying issue is serious.\n"
