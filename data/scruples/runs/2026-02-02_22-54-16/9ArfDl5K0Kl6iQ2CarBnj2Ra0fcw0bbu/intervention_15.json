However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet. The context provided includes Annie's harmful behavior towards her daughter, who the author helped by calling CPS. The author feels justified in their response because they believe Annie is hypocritical for forcing her daughter to diet while not doing it herself.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from both sides. Annie's actions are definitely problematic. She forced her daughter into a harmful diet program, which led to the daughter becoming severely underweight and injured. The author intervened by reporting to CPS, which shows concern for the child's well-being. However, the author then made a comment implying that Annie should also go on the same diet. The key here is whether the author's comment was an appropriate response.\n\nThe author's intention was to point out the hypocrisy, but the method might be questionable. Publicly calling someone out in a way that's sarcastic or implies criticism without directly addressing the harmful behavior might not be the most effective or ethical approach. The author's comment could be seen as a personal attack rather than addressing the real issue, which was the daughter's treatment. Even though the author's actions (calling CPS) were right, the comment about Annie's weight might not be justified. The focus should have remained on the daughter's welfare rather than the mother's weight, which is a separate issue. The author might have overstepped by using Annie's own weight as a form of retaliation, which could be considered unkind or discriminatory, regardless of the situation. Weight-based comments can perpetuate stigma and are often not helpful. So, while the author's concern is valid, the method of addressing it by making a sarcastic comment about Annie's weight might place the author in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
