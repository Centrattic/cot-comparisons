However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet. The coworker, Annie, forced her daughter to undergo an extreme diet program, which led to the daughter becoming underweight and having health issues. The author, concerned about this, made a comment implying that Annie should also try the program, given her own weight.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. Annie's actions towards her daughter are clearly problematic. She used her daughter's college funds for a weight loss program, which seems coercive and potentially harmful, especially since the daughter is already involved in multiple physical activities and is an academic standout. The author's intervention led to contacting CPS, which didn't result in action, so the author then made a sarcastic comment in the office.\n\nNow, the question is about the author's comment. The author didn't directly criticize Annie's weight but used the situation to imply she should follow the same program. The key here is whether this comment was an appropriate response. \n\nIn terms of professional conduct, workplace interactions should be respectful. Even if the author's intention was to highlight the hypocrisy or to encourage Annie to address her own health, the approach might not have been the best. Calling out someone's weight in a public or semi-public setting (like the office) can be seen as bullying or discriminatory, especially since weight is a sensitive topic and can relate to health issues. The author's comment might be viewed as a form of shaming, which isn't productive and could be considered unprofessional.\n\nMoreover, the author's main concern was Annie's treatment of her daughter. While the author had valid concerns, the method of addressing it by making a comment about the mother's weight could be seen as crossing a line. The author might have better addressed the situation by continuing to support the daughter, perhaps through formal channels rather than making a personal jab at Annie. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intent was to highlight the inconsistency and potential harm in Annie's actions. However, in professional settings, personal attacks or shaming, even indirect, can escalate conflicts and may not lead to the desired outcome. The author's comment might have been a result of frustration, but it's important to consider the impact on workplace relationships and the appropriateness of the response.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's comment, while possibly well-intentioned, was likely unprofessional and could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
