However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet. The situation involves Annie forcing her daughter into an extreme diet program that led to the daughter being severely underweight. The author called CPS, which didn't result in action, and then made a sarcastic comment to Annie about joining the same program.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if the author's actions were justified. The main issue here is Annie's behavior towards her daughter. Forcing a teenager into a restrictive diet that's harmful, using her college funds, and resulting in the daughter being underweight and injuring herself is clearly abusive and neglectful. The author tried to report this through CPS, which didn't act, so they took another step by confronting Annie sarcastically.\n\nNow, the author's sarcastic comment was a jab at Annie's own weight, implying she should do the same as her daughter. Even though the author didn't explicitly say \"you're overweight,\" the implication was there. The question is whether this was an appropriate response.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author's intention was to point out the hypocrisy of Annie not taking the same steps as her daughter. However, the method used\u2014making a snide comment in a public or semi-public work setting\u2014might be problematic. Even if the intent was good, the approach could be seen as unprofessional or bullying. The author might have been trying to get Annie to reflect, but public shaming, even with a sarcastic remark, isn't typically a recommended way to address such issues. It could also be considered a form of harassment, depending on the workplace's policies and culture.\n\nHowever, considering the severity of Annie's actions and the author's prior efforts to report it (CPS call), the author might feel justified in trying to provoke a response. The comment could be seen as a last resort after official channels failed. Still, the author's approach might not be the best, and there's a risk of escalation. The key here is whether the author's actions were proportionate. While the underlying issue is grave, the method of confrontation might not be the most constructive. The author could be in the wrong for not using a more direct and respectful approach, even if their intentions were to help.\n\nAdditionally, the author's comment was a veiled jab, which might be seen as passive-aggressive rather than addressing the issue directly. In the workplace, such comments can lead to a hostile environment, even if the intent is to critique someone's behavior. So, while the author is right to be concerned about Annie's actions, the way they expressed their disapproval might be unprofessional. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for the method, even if the concern was valid.\n"
