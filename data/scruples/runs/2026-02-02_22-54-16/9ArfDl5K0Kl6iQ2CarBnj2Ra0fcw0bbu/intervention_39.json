However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet, especially after witnessing the coworker's harmful actions towards her daughter.\n\nFirst, the coworker, Annie, forced her daughter into an extreme diet that led to the daughter becoming underweight and injured. The author tried to report it via CPS, but nothing came of it. Then, when Annie boasted about the daughter's success, the author made a comment implying Annie should follow the same program, which is a bit passive-aggressive but not direct.\n\nThe author's intention seems to be to point out the hypocrisy and perhaps make Annie reflect on her own behavior. However, the author isn't directly accusing Annie of wrongdoing in front of others, just making a sarcastic remark. The key point is whether this comment was an appropriate response given the situation.\n\nBut here's the catch: the author isn't in a position of authority to confront Annie publicly. Making a comment like that could be seen as unprofessional, especially in a workplace. Also, the author's actions might have crossed a line by using the daughter's situation to shame Annie, which could be considered a form of personal attack rather than addressing the actual issue.\n\nEven though Annie's actions are concerning, the author's response might not be the right approach. The appropriate steps would be to involve proper authorities or report through official channels if the situation is as harmful as described. The author's comment, while coming from a place of concern, could be seen as overstepping and contributing to a hostile work environment.\n\nSo, even though the author's intentions might be good, the method of confronting Annie was probably unwise and unprofessional. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
