However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet after witnessing Annie force her daughter to lose weight through a harmful program. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is disturbed by Annie's behavior towards her daughter. Annie made her daughter join a weight loss program that involved taking money from her college funds and starving, leading the daughter to become underweight and injured. The author, after trying to report it and CPS didn't act, confronts Annie by implying she should join the same program. The author is now questioning if they were right to do that.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intent and the method used. The author's concern is valid because Annie's actions were harmful. However, the way they confronted Annie was indirect and possibly passive-aggressive. Instead of directly addressing the issue or involving appropriate authorities, they made a comment that could be seen as mocking or implying hypocrisy. \n\nEven though the author's intention was to highlight the hypocrisy, the method might not be the most effective or ethical. Public shaming or indirect comments can sometimes backfire and might not lead to the desired change. Also, the author's comment could be seen as crossing a line, even if the underlying concern is justified. \n\nBut on the flip side, the author did try to help the daughter by contacting CPS. When that didn't work, they might have felt frustrated and used the only option they had, which was to confront Annie in a less-than-ideal way. However, the comment about Annie joining the program herself could be perceived as a form of retaliation or bullying rather than constructive criticism.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, while the author had good intentions, the action taken was questionable. The appropriate response would have been to handle it through proper channels or have a more direct, respectful conversation. Therefore, the author could be considered in the wrong for the way they chose to respond.\n"
