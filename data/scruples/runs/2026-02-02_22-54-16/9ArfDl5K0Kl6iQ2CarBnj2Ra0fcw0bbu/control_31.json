However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet, based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The coworker, Annie, forced her daughter to go on an extreme diet, leading the daughter to become severely underweight. The author, upset by this, made a sarcastic comment implying that Annie should join the same program. Now they're wondering if they were wrong to do that.\n\nSo, the main points here are: Annie's actions towards her daughter are concerning and potentially harmful. The author tried to intervene by calling out Annie indirectly. The question is whether the author's response was appropriate.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author had a valid concern about a minor being harmed. However, the method they used to address it was a public, sarcastic remark rather than a direct, private approach. But since they were in the office and the comment was made to Annie directly, it might be considered a form of confrontation. However, the author didn't report the abuse through official channels like CPS; they did call CPS initially, but the home visit didn't result in action. \n\nThe author's comment might be seen as crossing a line because it's a form of public shaming, even if it's to make a point. However, Annie's actions were clearly abusive, and the author's intention was to highlight the hypocrisy. The problem is whether the author's method was appropriate. Public shaming can be counterproductive and may not address the root issue effectively. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to help the daughter by holding Annie accountable. But the approach might have been unprofessional and could have backfired, leading to Annie becoming defensive instead of seeking help. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were trying to help someone in need. But the method of using a sarcastic comment in the workplace could be unprofessional and potentially harmful to their own workplace relationships. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's action was a reaction to a serious issue, but the approach might be seen as inappropriate. However, the underlying issue with Annie's actions is a bigger problem. But the question is specifically whether the author is in the wrong for their comment. \n\nI think the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even though the intention was good, the method used was inappropriate and unprofessional. However, some might argue that it's not wrong because Annie's actions were worse. But from a standpoint of how to handle such situations, the author should have perhaps escalated the issue properly rather than making a sarcastic comment in the workplace.\n"
