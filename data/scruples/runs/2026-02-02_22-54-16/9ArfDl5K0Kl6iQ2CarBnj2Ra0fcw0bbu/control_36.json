However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet, based on the coworker's harmful behavior towards her daughter.\n\nFirst, the coworker, Annie, forced her daughter into a restrictive diet program, which led the daughter to become severely underweight and injured. The author, concerned about this, called CPS, which didn't result in action. Then, in a moment of anger, the author implied that Annie should also join the program, which was a veiled comment about her weight.\n\nNow, the key points here: The author's intention was to confront Annie's hypocrisy\u2014using a harmful program on her daughter but not applying it to herself. However, the method chosen was a passive-aggressive comment that could be seen as targeting Annie's weight, which is a sensitive and personal issue. \n\nEven though the author's concern was valid regarding the daughter's well-being, directly commenting on someone's weight in a public or work setting is generally considered inappropriate and can be seen as bullying or discriminatory. The author's action might have crossed a line by using Annie's own actions against her in a way that focused on her body size rather than the harmful behavior towards her daughter.\n\nAdditionally, the daughter's situation was serious, and the author's approach might have been a way to express frustration, but it's possible that a more constructive approach, like discussing the daughter's well-being without attacking Annie's weight, would have been better. The author's comment could have been hurtful and might not have encouraged the desired change in Annie's behavior.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while the author had good intentions, the method used was flawed. The comment about Annie's weight, even if implied, could be seen as discriminatory and unprofessional, especially in a workplace setting. Therefore, the author might be at fault for the way they addressed the issue, even if the underlying concern was valid.\n"
