However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet, based on the coworker's harmful actions towards her daughter. \n\nFirst, the coworker, Annie, forced her daughter into a strict diet program that led the daughter to become underweight and possibly harmed her health. The author, after witnessing this and reporting to CPS (which didn't result in action), lashed out by suggesting Annie join the same program. The author's intention was to highlight the hypocrisy but didn't directly address the coworker's actions. \n\nThe key points here are: the coworker's harmful behavior towards her daughter, the author's attempt to address it indirectly, and the question of whether the author's response was justified. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author's action was a form of confrontation, albeit passive-aggressive. Directly confronting someone about their weight can be seen as bullying, but in this context, the author's motivation was to address the coworker's harmful behavior. However, the approach might not be the most effective or respectful. \n\nLegally, the coworker's actions towards her daughter might be a separate issue that the author was right to report. But the author's response of suggesting the coworker lose weight might not address the root problem and could come off as unprofessional or discriminatory.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's intention was to address a serious issue, but the method used was not appropriate. The author is in a difficult situation, but the response might not be the best way to handle it. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
