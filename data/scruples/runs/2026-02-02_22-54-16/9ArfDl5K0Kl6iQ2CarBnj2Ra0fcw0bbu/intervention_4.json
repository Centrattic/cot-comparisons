However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet, based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The coworker, Annie, forced her daughter into a strict weight loss program that seems harmful. The daughter was underweight and injured herself. The author, concerned, called CPS, but nothing came of it. Then, the author confronted Annie by implying she should join the same program, leading to Annie being silent afterward.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intent and the context. The problem isn't just about making a comment about someone's weight but about responding to a situation where there's potential child abuse. The author's action was a reaction to witnessing harm to a minor. The coworker's behavior was abusive, and the author tried to address it by highlighting the hypocrisy.\n\nHowever, the method used might be questionable. Directly confronting someone about their weight, even with implied criticism, could be seen as crossing a boundary, even if the underlying issue is serious. But given the context of child neglect, the author's concern might be more justified than a simple case of body-shaming.\n\nBut wait, the author didn't directly accuse Annie of wrongdoing; instead, they made a sarcastic comment about Annie joining the program. The main issue is whether the author's comment was appropriate given the serious context. Since Annie's actions were harmful to her daughter, the author's comment might be a way to call out the hypocrisy without directly confronting her about the abuse. It's a tricky situation because the author is aware of the abuse and tried to make a point without overtly attacking Annie.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's possible the author did the right thing by trying to address the parent's behavior, albeit in a roundabout way. However, the comment might not be the best approach. But considering the severity of the child's treatment, the author's action could be seen as a justified response to expose the parent's harmful behavior, even if it was done indirectly.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because their comment was in response to a serious situation where the parent was endangering their child. The author's primary concern was the child's welfare, and they tried to highlight the parent's hypocrisy. Even though the method might be debatable, the intent was to address a more significant issue.\n"
