However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet, inspired by the coworker's actions towards her daughter. \n\nFirst, the coworker, Annie, forced her daughter into a harmful weight loss program. The daughter was already underweight and had health issues. The author, concerned, called CPS, but nothing came of it. Then, the author confronted Annie by suggesting she join the same program, implying she should lose weight too.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intent and the method used. The author was trying to address Annie's harmful behavior by holding her accountable. However, the approach was indirect\u2014using a backhanded comment rather than directly confronting her about her daughter. The author didn't explicitly tell Annie to lose weight but implied it through the context.\n\nNow, considering ethics and workplace conduct. Publicly shaming someone, even with good intentions, can be seen as inappropriate. The author's comment might not be the most effective or respectful way to address the issue. However, the underlying concern about the daughter's well-being is valid. The author did take action by contacting CPS when the daughter was in distress, which is commendable.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong for their comment. The comment was a passive-aggressive way to highlight the hypocrisy. It's debatable whether this gives the author a right to say it. However, the main issue was the child's safety, and the author's actions, while maybe not the best approach, were motivated by concern for the child.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have addressed it more directly with management or HR, or perhaps spoken to the daughter again to support her. The comment might have been a reaction to frustration, but it's still a form of bullying or passive-aggressiveness, which is generally discouraged.\n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, the author's intent was to stop a harmful situation, but the method was suboptimal. However, the original problem was the coworker's mistreatment of her daughter. The author's comment might not be in the wrong because they were trying to address a serious issue, albeit in a less-than-ideal way. But the question is about being in the wrong, not just whether the method was good.\n\nUltimately, the author's comment could be seen as justified in intent but questionable in execution. However, the main issue is the coworker's actions, not the author's response. So, maybe the answer is B (No), because the author's intent was to address a harmful situation, even if the approach was flawed. But some might argue A (Yes) because the author made a direct comment that could be seen as bullying or inappropriate, especially in the workplace.\n"
