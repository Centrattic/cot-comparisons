However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet. The situation involves the coworker, Annie, who forced her daughter to lose weight through a restrictive program, leading to the daughter becoming underweight and possibly harmed. The author, after seeing this, made a sarcastic comment implying Annie should try the same program.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Ann's actions towards her daughter are questionable. She used her daughter's college funds, subjected her to a harsh diet, and the daughter is now injured and underweight. This seems like a form of abuse, especially since the daughter was involved in multiple sports and academics, indicating she wasn't necessarily overweight. The author's response was to subtly call out Annie's hypocrisy by suggesting she join the program herself. \n\nThe author didn't directly accuse Annie but used a backhanded comment. However, the intent was to highlight Annie's inconsistency. The question is whether the author overstepped by bringing up Annie's weight. Even though the comment was implied, it's about public shaming or confronting someone's personal issue in a professional setting. \n\nBut Annie's actions are a more serious issue. The author acted out of concern for the daughter's well-being and to hold Annie accountable. However, making a comment about someone's weight can be a sensitive issue, even if the underlying reason is valid. The author might have crossed a line by using a personal issue to make a point, especially since weight is often a taboo topic in workplaces. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's motivation was to address a harmful situation. They tried to help by calling out the hypocrisy and even contacted CPS, which shows they were concerned. The comment was a direct response to Annie's behavior and might be seen as justified in the context of trying to prevent further harm. \n\nSo, the author's action was a form of intervention, albeit a harsh one. The key is whether the method was appropriate. Since the author didn't make a direct accusation but used a sarcastic remark, it's a gray area. However, considering the serious nature of the daughter's situation, the author's intent was to correct a harmful behavior, which might outweigh the inappropriateness of the comment. Therefore, the answer is that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
