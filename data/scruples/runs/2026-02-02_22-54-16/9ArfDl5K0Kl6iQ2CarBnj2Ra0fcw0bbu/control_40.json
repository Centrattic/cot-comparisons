However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet. The situation involves Annie forcing her daughter into a strict weight loss program, which the author found concerning and even contacted CPS about. The author then made a comment implying that Annie should join the same program.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author was worried about the daughter's health, which is valid. Forcing a teenager into a restrictive diet, especially taking money from college funds, is problematic. The author's intention was to call out Annie's hypocrisy, as she's overweight but made her daughter lose weight. The comment was a passive-aggressive way to suggest Annie should lose weight too.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is wrong. From an ethical standpoint, even if the author's intent was to help or point out hypocrisy, publicly shaming someone (even with implied comments) can be seen as crossing a line. However, considering the harm Annie caused her daughter, the author might feel justified. But the act of making a veiled comment to embarrass Annie could still be considered wrong, regardless of the motive. The author's action didn't directly address the issue with Annie or through proper channels (like HR or authorities), but instead chose a personal approach. This could be seen as the author's mistake.\n\nAlso, the author did contact CPS, which is a responsible step. However, the subsequent comment might not have been the best approach. It's possible that the author's anger led to an inappropriate response, even if their concern was valid. So, weighing the intent against the action, there's a case for both sides. But since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, the answer likely leans towards A (Yes), because the author used a passive-aggressive method that could be seen as bullying or unprofessional, even if they had good intentions. However, some might argue that the author was justified given Annie's actions. But in most ethical frameworks, the method of response is important. The answer might be A.\n"
