However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet. The context provided shows that Annie forced her own daughter into an extreme weight loss program, which led to the daughter becoming underweight and suffering health issues. The author felt compelled to confront Annie by implying she should follow the same program.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Annie's actions toward her daughter are concerning. Using a program that involves financial loss and restrictive dieting, leading to the daughter's health decline, seems abusive. The author intervened by reporting to CPS, which is a responsible action. However, when the author directly confronted Annie in the office, they made a comment implying Annie should lose weight. While the author didn't explicitly state Annie's weight, the implication was there. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong for that comment? It's a tricky balance between supporting the daughter and addressing Annie's own weight. The author's intention might have been to hold Annie accountable for her double standards. However, making a comment about someone's weight can be seen as insensitive or even discriminatory, especially in a workplace setting. Weight discrimination is a real issue, and even if the author had good intentions, the method might not be appropriate.\n\nBut there's also the argument that Annie's behavior was harmful, and the author was trying to address the injustice. The comment could be seen as a form of pointing out hypocrisy. However, the appropriate way to handle such a situation might involve more direct support for the daughter and less focus on Annie's weight, unless there's a clear and present danger.\n\nThe CPS involvement was a better approach. The author's comment might have been a snap reaction out of frustration. While the intention was to help the daughter and challenge Annie's actions, the comment could be viewed as crossing a line, especially if it was meant to shame Annie. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of their intent, but the action itself could be problematic. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might depend on cultural and workplace norms. However, generally, making a comment about someone's body weight, even in response to their harmful actions, isn't typically advisable. So, the author could be in the wrong in terms of their method. But I need to weigh the intent against the action. The answer might be B, but there's nuance.\n"
