However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

So the situation is about a coworker, Annie, who made her daughter go on a strict diet, even taking her college money, which led the daughter to become severely underweight and harm herself. The author, who witnessed this, called Child Protective Services (CPS), and when that didn't resolve things, they made a sarcastic comment to Annie about starting the same program, implying she should lose weight herself.\n\nFirst, the author's main concern is Annie's treatment of her daughter. The author did the right thing by contacting CPS because there was potential child neglect or abuse. But the author also made a comment to Annie that was meant to highlight the hypocrisy\u2014Annie's daughter was made to diet while Annie herself is overweight. The question is whether this comment was inappropriate.\n\nIn the workplace, it's important to maintain professionalism and avoid personal attacks, even if the intention is to address a moral issue. The author's comment was passive-aggressive and could be seen as a personal jab, not a constructive conversation. While the underlying issue with Annie's daughter is serious, the author's approach in the workplace might have crossed a line by using a public or semi-public setting to make a snide remark. This could affect workplace dynamics and might be considered unprofessional, even if the concern was valid.\n\nSo, even though the author had good intentions in trying to point out Annie's hypocrisy and had previously taken appropriate action (calling CPS), the method of addressing it by making a sarcastic comment in the workplace could be seen as inconsiderate and unprofessional. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how they handled it, despite the valid concerns.\n"
