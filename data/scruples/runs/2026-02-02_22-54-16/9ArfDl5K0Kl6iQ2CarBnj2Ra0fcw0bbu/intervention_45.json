However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet after witnessing Annie's harmful actions towards her daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The key points are that Annie forced her daughter into an extreme diet program, leading to the daughter becoming underweight and unhealthy. The author called Child Protective Services (CPS) because they were concerned. When Annie boasted about the results, the author made a sarcastic comment implying Annie should follow the same program. The author is now questioning if they were right to do so.\n\nI should consider the ethical aspects. Making a comment about someone's weight can be sensitive. But here, the author's action was a direct response to a harmful situation. The main issue is whether the author's comment was appropriate given the circumstances.\n\nAnnie's actions were definitely problematic. Forcing a teenage girl into an extreme diet is abusive, and the author took steps to report it. The author's comment was a form of passive-aggressive retaliation. However, the author didn't directly accuse Annie publicly or confront her, just implied she should follow the same program. The author's intent was to highlight the hypocrisy, not just to criticize her weight.\n\nBut weight is a sensitive topic. Even if the author's intention was to address Annie's harmful behavior, the comment might still be seen as shaming. However, given that Annie's actions were abusive, the author's reaction could be seen as a justified response. The comment was a way to point out the inconsistency without making a direct accusation, which might have been more confrontational.\n\nI should also consider if there's a better way the author could have handled it. Maybe addressing Annie directly about her daughter's situation or involving others. But the author did involve CPS, which is the right step. The comment, while maybe tactless, was a personal reaction to a traumatic situation.\n\nIn the end, the author's action was minor compared to Annie's abuse. The comment was a way to express frustration and highlight hypocrisy, which might be seen as a reasonable, if not perfect, response. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
