However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet. The situation involves the coworker, Annie, who made her daughter go through a strict diet program, leading to the daughter becoming underweight. The author tried to help by calling CPS, but that didn't result in any action. Then, the author made a comment to Annie implying she should also do the program, which made Annie stop talking about it. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want to know the answer.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethical aspects here. Annie's actions towards her daughter are clearly problematic. Forcing a child into an extreme diet that led to health issues and financial loss is harmful. The author intervened by contacting CPS, which is a responsible step. However, the author's comment to Annie about joining the program might be seen as a form of retaliation or public shaming. Even though the author's intention was to address the hypocrisy, using a sarcastic remark in a workplace setting could be unprofessional. \n\nIn a professional environment, direct confrontation might not be the best approach. The author's comment could be seen as crossing a line, even if the intention was good. However, considering the severity of Annie's actions towards her daughter, the author's reaction might be justified as a way to hold Annie accountable. But the method used (implying that Annie needs to diet) might not be the right approach, regardless of the intent.\n\nSo, the answer is a bit nuanced. The author is right to be concerned about the daughter's welfare, but the way they addressed it to Annie might not have been appropriate. The question is whether the comment was justified given the context. Since the author's intention was to highlight the hypocrisy and not to directly attack Annie's weight, but the implication was there, it's a tricky situation. In terms of right or wrong, the author made a comment that could be seen as mean or inappropriate, even if it was in response to a harmful situation. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they resorted to a personal jab instead of a more constructive approach. However, some might argue it's B (not in the wrong) because they were trying to address a serious issue. But I think the professional approach would be to not make such a comment, regardless of the intent. So I'm leaning towards A.\n"
