However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet. The situation is complex because it involves the coworker's actions towards her daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the full context. The coworker, Annie, forced her daughter into a strict weight loss program, which led the daughter to become underweight and possibly harm her health. The author, concerned, reported it to CPS, which didn't result in action. Then, the author confronted Annie by implying she should also join the program, which was a veiled comment about her weight.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: Annie's actions were harmful to her daughter, the author tried to intervene by reporting, and then made a comment to Annie. The author's comment was passive-aggressive, using the success of the program on the daughter to suggest Annie join it. \n\nIs the comment justified? While Annie's actions were wrong, the author's response was public and possibly humiliating. Direct confrontation might be more effective. However, the author's intention was to point out the inconsistency, but the method was indirect and could be seen as cruel. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did take steps to address the daughter's situation by calling CPS. The comment might have been a way to express frustration, but it's unclear if it helped. The author regrets the comment, indicating they see potential wrong in it. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author has a right to be concerned about the daughter's welfare, but the approach taken might cross a line. The comment could be seen as bullying or using guilt-tripping. However, given the context of a harmful situation, maybe the author's actions are somewhat understandable but still not appropriate. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the comment was a justified expression of concern or an unjustified personal attack. Since the author's comment was passive and implied, without directly addressing the harmful behavior, it might be considered in the wrong. The author should have perhaps addressed Annie's actions more directly rather than using a veiled comment. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
