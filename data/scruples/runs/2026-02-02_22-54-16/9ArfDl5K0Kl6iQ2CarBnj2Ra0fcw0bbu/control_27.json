However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the author is a coworker of Annie, who forced her daughter to go on an extreme diet, leading the daughter to become severely underweight. The author called CPS, which didn't result in action, and then confronted Annie by implying she should lose weight herself. The question is whether the author's comment was justified or wrong.\n\nThe key points to consider: \n\n1. The author was concerned about Annie's daughter's welfare and took action by contacting CPS. That shows they care about the child's well-being. However, CPS didn't do anything, which is frustrating. \n\n2. The author's comment to Annie was a passive-aggressive jab, using the daughter's successful (but harmful) weight loss program to imply Annie should do the same. The author didn't directly accuse Annie of being overweight but made it clear through implications. \n\n3. Annie is indeed overweight, and the author is upset that she didn't apply the same program to herself. The author's intention was to highlight the hypocrisy, but the method used might be problematic. \n\nNow, the ethics here. While the author had valid concerns about child abuse, the way they addressed it with Annie might have crossed a line. Publicly implying someone should lose weight, even if they are overweight, can be seen as bullying or discriminatory. The author's comment could be considered unprofessional and potentially offensive in a work setting. \n\nHowever, the author's motive was to address a harmful situation. Even though the method was questionable, the intention was to highlight the issue. But in the workplace, such comments can create a hostile environment. The author might have a point about Annie's hypocrisy, but the approach taken could be seen as inappropriate. \n\nThere's also the issue of the author's right to comment on someone's weight. Weight-related comments, even if indirect, can be hurtful and are often considered a form of bullying. The author's actions might have been driven by concern, but the method could be unethical regardless of the intention.\n\nIn summary, while the author's concerns about Annie's daughter are valid, the way they addressed it by targeting Annie's weight is likely inappropriate. The author's comment could be seen as bullying or unprofessional, even if their intentions were good. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
