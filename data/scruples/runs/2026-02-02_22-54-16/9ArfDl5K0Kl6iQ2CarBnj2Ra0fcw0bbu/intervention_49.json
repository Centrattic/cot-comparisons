However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet. The situation involves Annie's daughter being forced into a strict weight loss program that's harmful. The author intervened by implying Annie should do the same, pointing out the hypocrisy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Annie's actions towards her daughter are questionable. She took her daughter's money, forced her into a program that led to the daughter being underweight and unwell. The author tried to help by calling out Annie's behavior, which might have been a way to highlight the hypocrisy. But the author's comment was indirect\u2014implying Annie should do the same program without directly accusing her of being overweight. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author had a valid concern about child welfare and acted by calling Child Protective Services. On the other hand, the comment to Annie could be seen as a form of retaliation or shaming. However, the author's intention was to highlight the inconsistency in Annie's behavior. \n\nIn terms of workplace ethics, it's generally not appropriate to comment on someone's weight directly, but the author's comment was a subtle jab at the hypocrisy. The key here is that the author's comment was a response to witnessing abuse and wanting to address the parent's role in it. The comment might be seen as passive-aggressive, but the underlying issue was more severe. \n\nAlso, the author might not be in the wrong because their actions were motivated by concern for the daughter's well-being and a desire to hold Annie accountable for her actions. However, the method of addressing it could be questionable. But given the context of the abuse, the author's intentions might be more about justice than just body shaming. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's comment was a reaction to a serious issue. While the approach could be criticized, the underlying intent was to address the parent's harmful behavior. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
