However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who posted the story is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet. The situation involves Annie, the coworker, who made her daughter go through an extreme weight loss program. The author feels that Annie's actions are harmful and hypocritical since Annie is overweight herself. The author then made a comment implying Annie should do the same program.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethics here. The main issue is whether the author's comment was appropriate. The author saw Annie's daughter being harmed through an extreme diet, which the author reported to CPS. Now, the author is trying to hold Annie accountable by suggesting she should also go on the diet.\n\nBut wait, the author didn't directly accuse Annie of wrongdoing in front of others or make it public. The comment was a personal jab, implying hypocrisy without explicitly stating it. However, the author is aware of the harm done to the daughter, so their intention might be to call out Annie's hypocrisy. But is it the author's place to say that?\n\nIn terms of workplace behavior, making a sarcastic comment about someone's weight could be considered unprofessional or even discriminatory. Weight is a protected class in some places, so commenting on it could lead to legal issues. Also, even if the author's intention was to highlight Annie's hypocrisy, the comment might be seen as bullying or harassment. The author could be in the wrong for bringing up personal matters that aren't relevant to the workplace.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to address a situation where they believe a minor is being harmed. They took action by calling CPS, which is appropriate. The comment might be a way to express frustration and hold Annie accountable. However, using a passive-aggressive comment might not be the best approach. It's possible the author is not in the wrong because they were trying to help the daughter, but the method could be questionable.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author's comment was a form of retaliation or a justified response. Since the author is in the workplace, they might have crossed a line by making a personal jab about someone's weight, which is a sensitive topic. The author could be seen as using a personal attack rather than addressing the issue through proper channels. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because the comment could be considered unprofessional and discriminatory, even if the intention was good.\n"
