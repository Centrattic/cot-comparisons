However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation involves Annie's daughter being forced into a restrictive diet that led to her being underweight and injured. The author, after witnessing this and reporting it to CPS, confronted Annie by suggesting she join the same program. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nLooking at the facts: Annie forced her daughter into a harmful diet, which the author found out and tried to address. The author's comment was indirect, implying Annie should lose weight too. Now, the key points here are the author's intent and the method used. \n\nOn one hand, the author was trying to address a harmful behavior by pointing out the hypocrisy. But on the other hand, commenting on someone's weight, even if with good intentions, can be seen as a personal attack. Weight is a sensitive topic, and public shaming, even indirectly, isn't the healthiest approach. \n\nHowever, the author's main issue is with Annie's actions towards her daughter, not just her weight. The comment was a response to that hypocrisy. But the problem is whether the author had the right to make that comment in the workplace. \n\nEven though the author's intentions were to help the daughter and address Annie's behavior, the method might have been inappropriate. Instead of confronting Annie directly about her parenting, the author used a veiled insult about her weight. This could be seen as crossing a line, as it's a personal matter and not the author's place to dictate. \n\nMoreover, the author did take action by reporting to CPS, which was the right thing to do. But the comment might have been an impulsive reaction. The author might have thought that by suggesting Annie do the same, it would make her reflect on her actions. However, it's possible that this approach didn't address the root issue and could have made Annie defensive instead of receptive.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while the author was concerned about the daughter's well-being, the method of addressing the parent's own weight might not be the most effective or appropriate. There's a difference between advocating for the daughter and making a personal comment about the parent. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's comment was a response to a harmful situation, but the approach was flawed. The author is partially in the wrong for making a personal comment in the workplace about someone's weight, even if it was in response to another issue. However, the underlying concern about the daughter's welfare was valid, but the method of addressing it could have been better handled through proper channels or direct confrontation rather than an indirect jab.\n"
