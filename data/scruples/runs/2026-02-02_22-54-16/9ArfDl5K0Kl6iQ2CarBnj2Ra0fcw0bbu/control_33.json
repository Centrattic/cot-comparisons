However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker, Annie, to go on a diet, based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: Annie forced her daughter into an extreme diet program, which led to the daughter becoming underweight and health issues. The author intervened by calling CPS, which didn't result in action. Then, the author confronted Annie by implying she should do the same diet, leading to Annie's silence and the daughter not returning.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is at fault. Let's look at the actions. The author's coworker was abusive towards her daughter's health. The author tried to help by reporting to CPS, which is appropriate. Then, when that didn't work, the author made a comment to Annie, which was indirect but implied criticism of her weight. The comment was not direct but had the implication that Annie should lose weight since she made her daughter do so. \n\nIs the author's comment considered bullying or appropriate? The author was trying to hold Annie accountable for her actions, using the same method Annie used. But was it right to target Annie's weight? Even though the author had a valid reason (Annie's harmful behavior), using a comment about weight could be seen as crossing a line. However, the author didn't directly accuse Annie of being overweight but used the program's success as a suggestion. \n\nAlso, considering that Annie's behavior was harmful, the author might feel justified. But in the workplace, making such a comment could be seen as unprofessional or even discriminatory. However, the intent was to address the harmful behavior, not just the weight. \n\nThe options are A (yes, author is wrong) or B (no). The answer depends on whether the comment was an appropriate response. While the author had a good reason, the method of confronting Annie in the workplace by implying a diet about her weight might be seen as crossing a line, even if intended to help. Therefore, the author might be at fault for using a personal attack (on weight) to address the issue, even if the issue was serious. So, the answer could be A. But some might argue it's B because the author was trying to help the daughter. However, the direct question is about the author's action of telling Annie to go on a diet. Since Annie's weight wasn't the issue (the issue was her treatment of the daughter), targeting her weight might be inappropriate. So the answer is A.\n"
