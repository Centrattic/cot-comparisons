However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their overweight coworker to go on a diet. The situation involves the coworker, Annie, who forced her daughter into a strict weight loss program, which seems harmful. The author called out Annie by implying she should do the same program herself.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The main issue is whether the author's response was justified given Annie's actions. The author is concerned about the daughter's health and took steps like calling CPS, which shows they were trying to help. The comment was a pointed remark, but it's unclear if it was meant to shame Annie or highlight hypocrisy. \n\nThe author might be in the right because they were trying to address a harmful situation indirectly. However, the approach of publicly implying the same diet for Annie could come off as cruel or bullying, especially since it's a sensitive topic. Even though the intention was to point out hypocrisy, the method could be seen as a personal attack rather than addressing the root issue. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions were a direct response to a harmful situation. They had tried calling CPS, which didn't resolve the issue, so maybe they felt it was their only option within the workplace. But is it appropriate to use such a comment? It's a gray area. \n\nI think the key here is whether the comment was constructive or just punitive. The author's comment might not have been the best approach, but their concern was valid. However, the way they addressed it could be considered unprofessional or even cruel, especially since it's a personal matter. So maybe the answer is A (in the wrong) because the method of response could be seen as inappropriate, even if the concern was valid.\n"
