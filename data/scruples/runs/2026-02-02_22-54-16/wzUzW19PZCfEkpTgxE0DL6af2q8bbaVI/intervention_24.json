I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for answering the door in their boxers. The author did this before when they didn't have pants on, thinking it was okay because they didn't want to keep the delivery person waiting. The pizza guy got uncomfortable and stepped back, and the author's wife criticized them for it. Now the author is wondering if they should start dressing more appropriately.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many places, answering the door in underwear is generally considered inappropriate, even if it's just for a quick delivery. People might feel exposed or embarrassed if someone sees them in such a state. The key points here are the delivery person's reaction and the author's wife's opinion. The delivery guy was clearly uncomfortable, which suggests that the author's actions made him feel uneasy. The wife's criticism also points to a possible breach of social etiquette.\n\nAnother angle is the author's reasoning. They thought delivery people have seen worse, so it's okay. However, even if delivery people have encountered various situations, it doesn't mean they appreciate being exposed to anything uncomfortable. The author's assumption that it's harmless might overlook the delivery person's personal boundaries and comfort.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of respect and professionalism. The delivery person is doing a job, and the customer should maintain a level of respect that considers the delivery person's comfort. The author's action might be seen as a violation of that mutual respect. The fact that the author tried to minimize the interaction by signing quickly shows they recognized the potential awkwardness, but the damage was already done.\n\nOn the flip side, the author might argue that they were in a hurry and didn't want to keep the delivery person waiting. However, the solution to that problem should be to either put on appropriate clothing or ask the delivery person to wait a minute. There's a balance between politeness and appropriateness. The author's past actions of answering in underwear might have been accepted before, but the current situation with the delivery person's reaction indicates that it's not always the right approach.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's action, while perhaps well-intentioned, likely caused discomfort to the delivery person. Social norms generally expect a certain level of modesty when answering the door for strangers, even if they're service workers. The wife's criticism is valid in pointing out that the author's action was inconsiderate. So, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
