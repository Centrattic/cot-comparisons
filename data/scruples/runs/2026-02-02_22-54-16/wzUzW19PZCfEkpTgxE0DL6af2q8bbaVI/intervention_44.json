I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers for a pizza delivery person. The author's reasoning is that they've done it before, others like pizza guys might have seen worse, and they were trying to be polite by not making the delivery person wait. But this time, the delivery guy was uncomfortable, and the wife said it was \"shitty\" of him.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about social norms and respect for others' comfort. The author's actions were driven by a desire to be polite by not making the delivery person wait, which is understandable. However, the delivery person's reaction indicates that the author's choice made them uncomfortable. The wife's disapproval adds another layer, suggesting that even if the delivery person has seen worse, the action still wasn't appropriate.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms. In many societies, answering the door in underwear is considered inappropriate, especially with strangers. While it's common for people to be in casual attire at home, the threshold of what's acceptable when opening the door to someone outside can vary. The key here is that the author didn't consider the delivery person's perspective, even if their intention was good. The discomfort experienced by the delivery person is a valid reaction, so the author might be at fault for not anticipating or respecting that.\n\nHowever, the author's intention wasn't malicious. They were trying to be considerate by not making the delivery person wait. But respect for others' comfort and privacy is important. The author might not be in the wrong if they didn't know this was an issue, but the fact that the delivery person reacted strongly suggests that they crossed a line. The wife's criticism also points out that the action was rude. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention was good, the action did cause discomfort and was considered inappropriate by both the delivery person and the spouse. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
