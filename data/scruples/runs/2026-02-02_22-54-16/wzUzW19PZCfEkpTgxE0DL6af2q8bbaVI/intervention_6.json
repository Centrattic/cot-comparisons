I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who answered the door in boxers is in the wrong. The situation is about answering the door for a pizza delivery guy in just underwear because they didn't have pants ready and didn't want to keep the delivery person waiting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many places, especially in more casual settings, answering the door in underwear or pajamas isn't unheard of. People often do this when they're in a hurry or just didn't expect someone at the door. But the key point here is the reaction of the pizza guy. He was clearly uncomfortable and even took a step back. That's a red flag. The person's wife also criticized them for it, which adds another perspective.\n\nThe author argues that they thought delivery people have seen worse and wouldn't mind. But maybe that's a flawed assumption. Just because someone is a delivery person doesn't mean they're okay with seeing people in underwear. It's possible that they're just expected to be professional and not make a big deal out of it, but that doesn't mean the situation is appropriate. The discomfort of the delivery person is a valid concern here.\n\nAlso, the author's intention was to be polite by not keeping the person waiting. However, the method of doing so (being underdressed) might have caused the opposite effect. The delivery person's discomfort could be seen as the author not respecting their boundaries or the situation. Even if it wasn't intentional, the result was that someone felt uncomfortable. That's a key factor in determining blame.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they didn't know their appearance would be an issue. They might not have realized the delivery person was uncomfortable. But once they noticed the discomfort, they tried to end the interaction quickly. However, the wife's reaction and the delivery person's reaction suggest that it's better to be dressed when answering the door for strangers, even if it's just a delivery person.\n\nSo, considering both sides: the author's action might be seen as careless about the delivery person's comfort, even if it wasn't malicious. The right thing to do would be to put on a robe or some covering before answering the door. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they should have considered the delivery person's comfort and dressed appropriately even if they thought it was minor.\n"
