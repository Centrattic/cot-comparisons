I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for answering the door in their boxers. They mentioned doing it before without issues, but this time the pizza guy was uncomfortable. Their wife said it was shitty, and they're wondering if they should dress more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many cultures, answering the door in just boxers isn't uncommon, especially if it's a quick delivery. But the key here is the reaction of the delivery person. If he was clearly uncomfortable, maybe the author should be more considerate. However, they also mention that they thought delivery people see worse, so maybe it's not a big deal. But the wife's opinion is that it's inappropriate, which adds another layer.\n\nAnother angle is respect for others' comfort. Even if the author isn't being overtly inappropriate, making someone else uncomfortable could be a reason to adjust their behavior. The question is whether the act itself is wrong or if it's just about being considerate in this specific case. Since the author is now aware that it made the delivery person uncomfortable, maybe changing the habit is a good idea. But is that because they're in the wrong, or just being considerate? The answer might lean towards A (in the wrong) because they caused someone discomfort, but some might argue it's a personal choice unless there's a specific rule against it. Hmm.\n"
