I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers. The situation is that they did this a few times before, but the pizza guy was uncomfortable this time. The wife said it was shitty of him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Generally, people might expect to be presentable when answering the door for deliveries. While some might not mind, others could feel uncomfortable, especially if they're not used to it. The key point here is that the delivery guy was clearly uncomfortable, which the author noticed.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that since delivery people hear stories of worse, they wouldn't mind. But that's assuming they're all desensitized. However, each person is different. Just because someone has seen worse doesn't mean they can't still feel uncomfortable in a less extreme situation. The author's action, while maybe not malicious, does put the delivery person in an awkward position.\n\nThe wife's reaction suggests that it's inconsiderate. Even if the author didn't mean any harm, the fact that the delivery guy was physically stepping back shows that it was a negative experience. So, the author should take responsibility and maybe take time to dress more appropriately next time to avoid making others uncomfortable. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to be polite by not making the delivery wait. But politeness should also consider the other person's comfort. There's a balance between convenience and respect. Since the delivery person was uncomfortable, the author might be in the wrong for not anticipating that reaction.\n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider the delivery person's comfort enough, despite their intention to be polite. It's about respecting others' boundaries and feelings, even in small interactions.\n"
