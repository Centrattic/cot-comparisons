I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who answered the door in their boxers is in the wrong. The situation is that they've done this before, but this time the pizza guy was uncomfortable. The wife is upset, and the person is questioning themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Answering the door in underwear is generally considered inappropriate because it can make the visitor uncomfortable. Even if the person didn't intend to, it's a privacy issue. The pizza guy stepping back shows he felt awkward, which the author might not have realized before. The wife's reaction also points to it being rude or inconsiderate.\n\nAnother angle is respect for the delivery person's job. They are doing a service, and expecting them to wait while someone dresses is part of the interaction. The author's reasoning that delivery people have seen worse might not justify it, as it's still a matter of personal comfort and respect. The author's actions could be seen as unprofessional or disrespectful, even if unintentional.\n\nHowever, maybe the author is more relaxed in their home and didn't mean to offend. But societal expectations often lean towards dressing appropriately for visitors, regardless of what others might have experienced. The key here is whether the action caused discomfort, which it did. So, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong because they caused discomfort and didn't consider the other person's feelings.\n"
