I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for opening the door in their boxers for a pizza delivery. The situation is that the author did this a few times before, but this time the pizza guy was uncomfortable. The wife also criticized them for it. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In some places, people might be more or less accepting of someone being in their underwear at home. If the author usually does this and others haven't had a problem before, maybe it's not inherently wrong. However, the pizza guy's reaction here was different\u2014taking steps back and being uncomfortable. That's a key point. The author might not have realized that this person felt uncomfortable. \n\nThen there's the wife's opinion. She said it was \"shitty\" of him. That adds to the social pressure. The author's justification is that they thought delivery people see worse and wouldn't mind. But maybe that's a flawed assumption. Just because someone sees a lot of things doesn't mean they want to see a person in their underwear. The author might have been assuming too much about the delivery person's comfort level.\n\nAlso, the act of answering the door in underwear could be seen as a breach of professional boundaries. The delivery person is there to do a job, and the customer's appearance might affect their comfort. The author's intention was to be polite and not keep the person waiting, which is understandable. But maybe the solution is to either answer the door dressed or find a balance.\n\nAnother angle is personal responsibility. The author is considering changing their behavior after this incident. The question is whether they were wrong for not dressing first. In some contexts, like a private home, people might feel they have the right to be in whatever state they choose. However, others might argue that when interacting with others, especially in public roles like delivery, it's respectful to dress appropriately, even at home.\n\nThe key factors are the delivery person's reaction and the wife's criticism. The author didn't intend to cause discomfort, but the outcome was that the delivery person felt uncomfortable. The question is whether the action itself, regardless of intent, was wrong. If the action led to someone's discomfort, even unintentionally, maybe the author is partly at fault. But is it the author's responsibility to anticipate that?\n\nIn terms of social norms, there's a line between being casual at home and respecting others' comfort. Some might say that even if the pizza guy saw worse, it's still not the customer's job to consider their comfort when answering the door. Others might argue that being considerate is part of being a good customer.\n\nSo weighing all this, the answer isn't straightforward. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of actions, but they could be in terms of considering the other person's feelings. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, which often relates to violating social rules, the author's actions might be seen as acceptable in some contexts but not in others. The fact that the pizza guy was uncomfortable and the wife criticized it suggests that there's a social expectation to dress appropriately when answering the door. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not adhering to that expectation, even if it's a minor issue.\n"
