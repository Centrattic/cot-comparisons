I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who answered the door in boxers is in the wrong. The situation involves answering the door for a pizza delivery guy in just underwear, which made the delivery person uncomfortable. The wife is upset, but the author didn't think much of it before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. In many cultures, especially in Western countries, it's common for people to wear pajamas or similar attire at home. However, when someone is at the door, especially someone you don't know, like a delivery person, there's an expectation of being somewhat dressed. Underwear might be considered too revealing, even if it's not intentional. The key here is the reaction of the delivery person stepping back and showing discomfort. That indicates that the author's attire made the other person uncomfortable, which might be a point against the author.\n\nThen there's the wife's reaction. She called it \"shitty,\" which suggests that from a spouse's perspective, she feels the author was inconsiderate. The author's reasoning was that delivery people have probably seen worse, but that's not a valid excuse. Just because someone's job involves seeing various situations doesn't mean they should be subjected to anything that makes them uncomfortable. The delivery person's right to feel comfortable and respected should be considered.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had done this before without issues, so maybe they didn't realize the impact. However, the fact that this time the delivery person was clearly uncomfortable shows that the author's action had a negative effect. The author's intention was to be polite by not making the delivery person wait, but the outcome was causing discomfort.\n\nSo, while the author might not have malicious intent, the act of answering the door in underwear (boxers) could be seen as inconsiderate towards the delivery person's feelings. The author should take into account that even if they don't feel it's an issue, others might. The appropriate action here would be to dress appropriately when answering the door for strangers to avoid making them uncomfortable. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because their action, although not intentional, caused discomfort to another person.\n"
