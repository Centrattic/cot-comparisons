I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who answered the door in boxers was in the wrong. The situation is that they did this a few times before, but this time the pizza guy was uncomfortable. The wife called it \"shitty,\" and the person is now doubting their actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Answering the door in underwear isn't exactly inappropriate, but it's also not the most professional or respectful. Pizza delivery people are just doing their job, and while they might be used to seeing various situations, making someone uncomfortable is not ideal. The key point here is that the pizza guy showed clear discomfort, which the author noticed and then felt guilty. The wife's reaction also adds weight to the idea that it's not the best choice.\n\nAnother angle is respect for others' comfort. Even if the author thinks it's normal, others might not feel the same. The fact that the delivery person took steps back indicates that the author's attire made them uncomfortable. It's about being considerate of others' feelings, not just the author's convenience. The author's reasoning that delivery people have \"seen worse\" might not account for individual differences in what people find uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, the wife's opinion is significant. While it's possible she's being overly critical, her reaction suggests that she values how others are treated, even strangers. The author's guilt after the incident shows they care about others' feelings, which is a good sign, but they might need to adjust their behavior to avoid causing discomfort.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, answering the door in underwear is generally acceptable for friends or family, but for service workers, it's better to be dressed modestly. It's a small action that can affect someone else's experience. The author might not be in the \"wrong\" in a legal or moral sense, but socially, it's considerate to dress appropriately when expecting delivery.\n\nSo, balancing all factors: the author's actions caused discomfort, the wife's criticism, and the general social norm of dressing respectfully when interacting with service providers. The answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong, as their actions, while not malicious, were inconsiderate and caused discomfort. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
