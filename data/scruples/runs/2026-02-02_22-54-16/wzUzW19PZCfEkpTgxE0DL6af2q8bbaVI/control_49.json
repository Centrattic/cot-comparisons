I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that he answered the door for a pizza delivery guy in his boxers, and the delivery person was uncomfortable. His wife called it shitty, and he's wondering if he should start dressing up more.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were wrong. The key points here are about social norms and respect for others' comfort. Wearing boxers to the door is usually considered a casual situation, but when someone is working, like a delivery person, they might be there for a reason. The delivery guy took a step back, showing he was uncomfortable. That's a sign the author's actions might have been inappropriate.\n\nThe author mentioned he's done this before without issues, but this time it was different. The delivery person's reaction matters. Even if others might be more accustomed to such situations, the key is that the delivery guy felt uncomfortable. The wife's disapproval adds another perspective, suggesting that maybe the author didn't consider others' feelings enough.\n\nSocial etiquette usually suggests being presentable when opening the door for service workers. While it's a small thing, it's about showing respect. The author's reasoning was that delivery people have seen worse, but maybe that's an excuse instead of considering the current person's feelings. So, the author might be in the wrong for not dressing appropriately and causing discomfort, even if unintentionally. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
