I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who answered the door in their boxers is in the wrong. The situation is that they answered the door for the pizza guy in their underwear a few times before, and this time the guy was uncomfortable. The wife said it was shitty of him, and he's wondering if he should start dressing before answering.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. In many places, it's common for people to answer the door in various states of dress, especially if they're at home. But there's also the aspect of respect and the other person's comfort. The pizza guy seemed clearly uncomfortable, so maybe the author should consider that.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they want to know my take. I have to weigh the author's intention (not wanting to keep the delivery person waiting) against the delivery person's reaction. The author might not have intended to make the person uncomfortable, but the impact is there. \n\nAlso, the wife's reaction is important. She says it's shitty, which might indicate that there's a social expectation the author isn't meeting. Even if the author thinks delivery people are used to worse, that doesn't mean it's okay to make them uncomfortable. Respecting others' boundaries is key here.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being hospitable by not making the delivery person wait. But there's a balance between being polite and respecting someone's comfort. Maybe the solution is to put on some pants quickly instead of just underwear. It's a small effort but could prevent discomfort.\n\nSo, the author's action might not be malicious, but the effect on the delivery person is negative. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (in the wrong) because they should consider others' feelings more. However, if the author's intention was good, maybe it's not entirely their fault. But since the delivery person was uncomfortable, the author should adjust their behavior to prevent that.\n"
