I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers. They provided the AITA scenario where the author did this a few times before, but this time the pizza guy was uncomfortable. The wife says it's shitty, but the author thought delivery people have seen worse.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author's intention was to avoid being rude by making the delivery person wait. They didn't mean to cause discomfort. However, the pizza guy's reaction was negative, and the wife is upset. \n\nIs there a wrong here? Well, the author's actions were unintentional. They didn't know the delivery person would be uncomfortable. But maybe they should have considered that some people might find it inappropriate. The key is whether the author had a duty to dress more appropriately, even if they thought others have seen worse. \n\nThe author's perspective is that they thought it was okay because they've heard stories from delivery people. But maybe that's a generalization. Not everyone is comfortable with that. The fact that the pizza guy took steps back shows it's a problem for him. \n\nHowever, the author's action was to be polite by not making the delivery wait. So there's a conflict between politeness and social norms. The question is whether being in boxers is offensive enough to be considered wrong. \n\nIn many cultures, answering the door in undergarments is considered inappropriate, even if it's common in some areas. The author might not be in the wrong if they didn't intend to offend, but they could be negligent in not considering the other person's comfort. \n\nThe wife's reaction suggests that she thinks it's wrong. But the author's intent was good. So is the wrong in the action itself, or the lack of consideration for others' feelings? \n\nI think it's a judgment call. The author isn't malicious, but maybe they should have worn something more appropriate. Since the delivery person was uncomfortable, the author's action did cause harm, even if unintended. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not being more considerate. But others might argue that it's a minor issue. \n\nHmm. The answer depends on whether being in boxers is considered wrong in this context. Since the delivery person was visibly uncomfortable, the author's action did have a negative impact. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not dressing more appropriately, even if they thought it was okay before. So the answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
