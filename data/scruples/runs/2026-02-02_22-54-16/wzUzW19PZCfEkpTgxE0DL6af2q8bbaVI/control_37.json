I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who answered the door in their boxers is in the wrong. The situation is that they answered the door for a pizza delivery guy in just their boxers a few times before, but this time the delivery person was clearly uncomfortable. The person's wife called it \"shitty\" of them to do so. The person is wondering if they should start dressing more appropriately when opening the door for deliveries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many places, people might answer the door in casual attire, including underwear, if they're in a hurry or just haven't put on pants yet. However, it's also common to put on at least a shirt or something more modest, especially if there's a delivery person. But the key here is the delivery person's reaction. This time, the pizza guy was uncomfortable and even stepped back. That suggests that the person's attire made him feel uneasy. \n\nThe author's wife is critical, so maybe the wife's perspective is that it's disrespectful or unprofessional to the delivery worker. The author's reasoning is that delivery people see worse, so they wouldn't mind. But maybe the author is projecting their own assumptions onto the delivery person. Just because someone is a delivery person doesn't mean they want to see customers in their underwear. It's possible that the delivery person's job is to deliver food, not to be subjected to various states of dress, even if it's common. \n\nAlso, there's a consideration of respect and professionalism. The delivery person might be there to do their job, and seeing a customer in a state of undress could make them uncomfortable, affecting their job performance or making them feel disrespected. The author might not have intended to cause discomfort, but the result was that the delivery person was physically uncomfortable. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's a minor issue and that the delivery person's job requires them to handle various situations. But the fact that the author's wife is upset and the delivery person was uncomfortable suggests that there's a social expectation to present oneself in a more dressed manner, even if it's just a quick delivery. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the author's actions violated social norms or caused unnecessary discomfort. Since the delivery person was clearly uncomfortable and the author's wife is critical, it's likely that the author should reconsider their approach. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
