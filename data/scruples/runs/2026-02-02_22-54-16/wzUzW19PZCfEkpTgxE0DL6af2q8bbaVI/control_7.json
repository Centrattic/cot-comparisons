I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers. The author's reasoning is that they didn't want to make the pizza guy wait, and they thought delivery people see worse stuff. But the pizza guy was uncomfortable, and the wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many places, answering the door in underwear isn't considered standard. Most people probably expect you to be dressed, even if it's just for deliveries. The fact that the pizza guy took steps back shows he felt awkward or uncomfortable, which is a sign that the author's actions were not appropriate in that context.\n\nThe author's wife called it \"shitty,\" which is a strong reaction. Maybe the wife is right because she's the partner and might have a closer relationship with the author. Also, the author's reasoning about delivery people seeing worse might not apply here. Just because someone might be exposed to various situations doesn't mean they appreciate being presented with something they find uncomfortable. It's about respecting others' boundaries and comfort levels.\n\nThere's also the aspect of respect. Even if the author didn't intend to make the delivery person uncomfortable, the act of answering the door in boxers could be seen as not respecting the delivery person's experience. It's about being considerate of others' feelings, even if it's a quick interaction. The author's action caused guilt, which indicates they realized it might not have been the best choice.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to be polite by not keeping the delivery person waiting. That's commendable, but there's a balance between politeness and appropriateness. Maybe dressing even a little more, like putting on pants, would have been a better approach. The key here is that the author should have considered the delivery person's comfort, which they didn't, leading to the discomfort observed.\n\nSo putting it all together, even though the author had good intentions, the action itself was inconsiderate of the delivery person's feelings. The fact that the wife is upset and the delivery person was uncomfortable suggests that the author was in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
