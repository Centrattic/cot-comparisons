I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for answering the door in their boxers. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They answered the door for a pizza delivery guy in their boxers. They mention doing this before when they don't have pants ready, just to avoid keeping the delivery person waiting. The pizza guy here was uncomfortable, even stepped back. The wife is upset, but the person thought pizza guys have seen worse and wouldn't mind. Now they're asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's consider social norms. In many places, answering the door in underwear or just boxers is generally considered acceptable for delivery people, as they're often just there for a quick transaction. However, the key here is the reaction of the pizza guy. He was clearly uncomfortable. That might indicate that even if it's common, some people still find it awkward or inappropriate.\n\nThe author's wife is upset, so there's a domestic perspective here. She thinks it's \"shitty\" of him to answer the door like that. That suggests that in their household, there's an expectation of dressing more appropriately for visitors, even if they're delivery people.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reasoning is that they've heard stories from delivery workers implying they've seen worse, so maybe they thought it was okay. But just because someone might have encountered similar situations doesn't mean they're comfortable with every instance. The specific reaction here was discomfort, so maybe the author didn't consider that individual's feelings.\n\nAlso, the author's intention was to be polite and not keep the delivery person waiting. That's commendable, but the means (wearing boxers) might not consider the other person's feelings. There's a balance between being considerate of the delivery person's time and being respectful of their comfort.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the act of answering the door in boxers is inherently wrong. In many cultures, it's not a big deal for single people or couples, especially if they're just there for a quick drop-off. However, if the delivery person feels uncomfortable, maybe the author should adjust their behavior. The wife's disapproval adds another layer, as it's about their household norms. \n\nBut is the author wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. They weren't malicious, but they might have been inconsiderate. However, the line between what's acceptable and not can be subjective. The pizza guy's reaction is a valid point, but it's also possible that the author's actions are within acceptable norms. \n\nI'm leaning towards saying the author isn't in the wrong because their intention was to be polite, and it's a common occurrence for delivery people. However, considering the delivery person's comfort is important, so maybe there's room for improvement. But ultimately, the answer might depend on cultural context and personal boundaries. Given the information, I think the answer is B (the author isn't in the wrong) because their actions were not malicious and they had a reason to act quickly. The discomfort was unexpected, but that doesn't necessarily make them wrong.\n"
