I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who answered the door in their boxers is in the wrong. The situation is that they usually do this when they don't have pants ready, thinking it's okay since pizza delivery people have probably seen worse. But this time, the guy was uncomfortable and stepped back. The wife is upset, and now they're questioning if they should dress more before answering.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about social norms and respect for others' comfort. On one hand, the person might not have intended to offend and thought it was normal. On the other, the delivery person's reaction shows that it's not okay for everyone. The wife's reaction also points to the fact that it's considered rude or inappropriate by some standards.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the action was considerate. The person might not have realized the impact, but since the delivery guy was clearly uncomfortable, it's a sign that their action was inconsiderate. The author should probably consider dressing more appropriately to avoid making others feel awkward. So, the author is in the wrong because they didn't take into account the other person's feelings, even if unintentionally. Answer A.\n"
