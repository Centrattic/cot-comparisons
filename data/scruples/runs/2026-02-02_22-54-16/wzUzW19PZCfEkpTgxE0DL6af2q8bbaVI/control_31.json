I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers. So, the situation is that the person opened the door for a pizza delivery guy in just their underwear, which made the delivery person uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many cultures, it's generally considered polite to dress appropriately when answering the door, especially for someone outside the household. Boxers are underwear, so maybe that's too casual. But some people might think it's fine if they're in a hurry or just don't have clothes on. However, the key point here is that the delivery person was uncomfortable. That's a red flag. Even if it's not illegal, being considerate of others' feelings is part of social etiquette.\n\nThe author mentioned that their wife said it was \"shitty\" of them to do that. That's another person's perspective, and sometimes family feedback matters. Also, the author's reasoning was that delivery people have seen worse, so they thought it wouldn't matter. But that's a bit of a flawed assumption. Just because someone might have seen worse doesn't mean they want to encounter it every time. Everyone's comfort level is different. The delivery guy's reaction of stepping back shows he was visibly upset, which the author then felt guilty about.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for making someone else uncomfortable, even if unintentionally. The author's action might have been a breach of the delivery person's personal space or comfort. It's about respecting others' boundaries. Even if the author didn't mean to be rude, the impact on the delivery person is what's important here. \n\nSo, while there's no legal wrong, socially, the author might be at fault. The question is whether the author should have known better. They had done it before without issues, but this time it was different. So, maybe the answer is that the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the other person's comfort, even if it wasn't intentional. The wife's criticism also suggests there's a social expectation to dress properly when answering the door for strangers.\n\nBut wait, some might argue that it's a minor issue and the delivery person shouldn't be so sensitive. However, the author's guilt and the delivery person's reaction indicate that it was a problem. The key is whether it's reasonable to expect someone to avoid making others uncomfortable. Since the author didn't think twice before, maybe they should have considered the other person's perspective more. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
