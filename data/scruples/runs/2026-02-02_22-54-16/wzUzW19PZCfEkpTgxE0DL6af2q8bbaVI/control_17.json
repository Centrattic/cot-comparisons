I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author answered the door in their boxers for a pizza delivery guy, and the guy was uncomfortable. The wife was upset about it, and the author is now questioning if they should start dressing more when opening the door.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were wrong. The key points here are that the author was in a state of undress (boxers) and that the delivery person felt uncomfortable. The author's reasoning was that they didn't want to keep the person waiting and assumed delivery workers have seen worse, so they wouldn't mind.\n\nNow, considering social norms and respect for others' comfort. Even if the delivery person has seen worse, that doesn't mean they should have to see someone in underwear. It's about the other person's comfort and the author's responsibility to consider that. The author's wife's reaction might be a clue that their actions were inappropriate, but I shouldn't rely solely on that. \n\nIn many cultures, especially in Western ones, it's considered inappropriate to answer the door in underwear for strangers. The author might have violated the delivery person's personal space or made them feel uneasy. The fact that the delivery person took steps back shows that their discomfort was physical, which is a significant reaction.\n\nThe author's intent was to be polite and not make the person wait, but the method used (being in boxers) could be seen as disrespectful or inconsiderate. They could have offered to wait a minute to put on pants instead. The assumption that delivery workers are okay with seeing people in underwear might not hold true in all cases, as people have different boundaries and comfort levels.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't take into account the delivery person's possible discomfort and chose a solution that, while quick, was not respectful. The answer would be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
