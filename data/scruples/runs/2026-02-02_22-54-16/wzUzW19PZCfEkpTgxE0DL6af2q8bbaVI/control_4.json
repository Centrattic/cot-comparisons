I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who answered the door in boxers was in the wrong. The user provided a Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario where the person answers the door for a pizza delivery in a boxers, the delivery guy seems uncomfortable, and the wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the societal norms around answering the door in underwear. In many places, it's common for people to answer the door in casual wear, especially if they're at home and it's late. But there's a line between casual and inappropriate. Boxers might be considered semi-nude by some standards, depending on the region and cultural norms.\n\nThe person's reasoning is that they don't want to keep the delivery person waiting and that they thought delivery people see worse. However, the delivery guy's reaction was uncomfortable, stepping back, which indicates that maybe the situation wasn't appropriate. The wife also called it \"shitty\" of him, which is a moral judgment from someone close to him.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) Intentionally exposing oneself in a way that could cause discomfort to another person, even if it's unintentional on their part, 2) The reaction of the delivery person, and 3) The wife's disapproval.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, while it's common to answer the door in pajamas or similar attire, boxers might be considered too revealing in some contexts. The person might not have realized that their choice of attire was making the delivery person uncomfortable. The delivery person stepping back is a clear sign of discomfort, which suggests that the person might have overstepped.\n\nBut then again, it's a delivery person doing their job, and they might be used to seeing various situations. However, the person's own reaction (feeling guilty afterward) and the wife's disapproval indicate that there's a moral consideration here. Even if the delivery person is used to seeing worse, causing someone discomfort, even if unintentionally, could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, balancing these factors, the person might be in the wrong because they caused discomfort to another person, even if it wasn't intentional. The fact that their spouse disapproves adds another layer. The answer might be A (Yes), but I'm a bit split because it's a common situation. However, the discomfort caused and the wife's reaction lean towards AITA being Yes.\n"
