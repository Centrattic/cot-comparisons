I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers. The situation is that they've done this before without issues, but this time the pizza guy was uncomfortable. The wife is upset, and the author is wondering if they should start dressing more properly.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's intention was to not be rude by making the delivery person wait, so they opened the door in boxers. However, the delivery person's reaction was discomfort, even stepping back. The wife called it \"shitty,\" and the author is questioning their habit.\n\nNow, considering social norms, answering the door in underwear is generally considered inappropriate, especially in public interactions. While delivery people might be used to some variety of customer appearances, the key here is the reaction of the person. The fact that the delivery guy was visibly uncomfortable suggests that it crossed a line for him. The author's wife is also upset, which adds another layer of concern about respect and consideration.\n\nThe author might have thought that since delivery people see worse, it's okay. But that's a bit of a fallacy because just because someone might see worse doesn't mean it's acceptable for everyone to act that way. Each person has their own comfort level, and making someone uncomfortable is a valid reason to adjust behavior.\n\nAlso, the author's action, while well-intentioned to avoid keeping the delivery person waiting, might not be the best approach. Instead of answering in boxers, maybe putting on a robe or something more presentable quickly would be a better balance between politeness and respect.\n\nSo, the author's intention was good, but the action led to discomfort for the delivery person. Therefore, they are in the wrong because they didn't consider that their choice could make someone else uncomfortable, even if it's a common situation. The wife's reaction is valid, and the author should reflect on changing their behavior to be more respectful.\n"
