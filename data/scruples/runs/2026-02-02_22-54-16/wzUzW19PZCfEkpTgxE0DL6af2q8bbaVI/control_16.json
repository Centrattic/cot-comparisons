I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers. The situation is that the pizza delivery guy was uncomfortable, and the author's wife is upset. The author has done this before but now feels guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many cultures, answering the door in underwear isn't considered appropriate for strangers, especially delivery people. Even if the author thinks pizza guys have seen worse, it's still the customer's responsibility to present themselves respectfully. The delivery person's reaction\u2014stepping back\u2014indicates discomfort, which the author noticed. That's a sign that their action had a negative impact, even if unintentional.\n\nThe wife's reaction is also a factor. She called it \"shitty,\" which implies she thinks it's inconsiderate. The author's justification is based on convenience and not wanting to keep the delivery waiting, but that's not a strong enough reason to disregard the other person's feelings.\n\nHowever, some might argue that it's a minor issue, and the delivery person should be used to such situations. But the key here is the effect on the other person. The author's action made the delivery person uncomfortable, which is a valid reason to reconsider their behavior. The question is whether the author should have known better. Since they had previous instances without issues, maybe they thought it was okay, but the recent reaction suggests they need to change their habit. So, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
