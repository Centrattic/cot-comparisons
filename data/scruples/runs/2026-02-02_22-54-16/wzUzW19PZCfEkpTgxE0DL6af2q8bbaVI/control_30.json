I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person answered the door for a pizza delivery guy in their boxers. They mention they've done this before, but this time the delivery person was uncomfortable. Their wife is upset, and they're wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many places, especially in Western countries, it's common for people to answer doors in less formal attire, especially for deliveries. They might be in pajamas, underwear, or even just a t-shirt. However, the situation is different if the person is visibly uncomfortable. The key here is the reaction of the delivery person. The user notes that the pizza guy took a step back, indicating he felt awkward or maybe even disrespected. \n\nThe user's wife called it \"shitty,\" which suggests that she believes it's inconsiderate. The user's reasoning was that delivery people see worse, so it's okay. But maybe the assumption is flawed. Just because someone might have seen worse doesn't mean they don't mind being exposed to anything. It's possible that the delivery person was put off by the lack of consideration for his comfort.\n\nAnother angle is respect and professionalism. Delivery people are doing a job, and customers might not realize how their actions affect the workers' experience. Even if the user didn't intend to offend, the act of answering the door in boxers could be seen as a breach of the delivery person's comfort. The user's guilt and the delivery person's reaction imply that there's a social norm being crossed here.\n\nBut on the other hand, some might argue that it's a minor issue. People are often in a rush and might not be fully dressed when answering the door. The user's intention was to be polite by not keeping the delivery person waiting. However, the key point is that the delivery person was visibly uncomfortable, which shifts the perspective from minor inconvenience to a more significant issue of mutual respect.\n\nAlso, the user's wife's reaction adds weight to the idea that there's a problem. Spouses often provide a different viewpoint, and if she's calling it \"shitty,\" it's worth considering. The user's previous assumption that delivery people are used to worse might not hold in all cases. It's possible that the user's actions, while not malicious, were inconsiderate.\n\nIn summary, the user's actions might be seen as inconsiderate because they caused discomfort to the delivery person. The fact that the delivery person was visibly uncomfortable and the wife's disapproval suggest that the user is in the wrong. The user should consider dressing more appropriately to respect the delivery person's comfort and maintain a professional interaction.\n"
