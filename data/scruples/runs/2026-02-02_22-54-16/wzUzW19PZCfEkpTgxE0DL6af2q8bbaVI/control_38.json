I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who answered the door in boxers was wrong. The situation is that they didn't think much of it before, but this time the pizza guy was uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In some places, answering the door in underwear might be more common, but others might find it inappropriate. The pizza guy's reaction here was discomfort, even stepping back, which suggests the situation wasn't okay for him.\n\nThe wife's reaction is also a factor. She called it \"shitty,\" indicating she thinks it's wrong. The user's reasoning was that they didn't want to make the delivery person wait, but maybe they didn't consider the other person's feelings. \n\nThere's also the aspect of respecting others' boundaries. While the user might not have intended to cause discomfort, the fact that it did happen means there's a valid concern. The user should probably dress more appropriately for deliveries to avoid similar situations. \n\nSo, even if the user's intention was good, the outcome shows that their action was inconsiderate. Therefore, they might be in the wrong.\n"
