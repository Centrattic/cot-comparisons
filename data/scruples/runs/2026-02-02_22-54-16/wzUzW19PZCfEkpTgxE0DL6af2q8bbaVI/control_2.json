I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they answered the door for a pizza delivery guy in just their boxers, and the guy was uncomfortable, even stepping back. The author's wife called it \"shitty,\" and they're wondering if they should start dressing more properly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and expectations. Most people probably expect some level of modesty when opening the door for delivery. Being in a t-shirt and boxers is pretty casual, but maybe not appropriate for someone at the door, especially a stranger. Even if the author has done it before without issues, this time the pizza guy was clearly put off. That's a sign that it might be crossing a line.\n\nThen there's the aspect of respect and professionalism for the delivery person. The pizza guy is doing a job, and the customer's behavior should allow them to feel comfortable. Making someone uncomfortable, even unintentionally, could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's reasoning that \"they've all seen much worse\" might not hold because it's not about what others have seen, but about maintaining a basic level of decorum.\n\nThe wife's reaction is also a factor. If the spouse is uncomfortable with the behavior, that's a personal relationship issue. The author might need to respect her feelings even if they don't see the problem. But the main question is whether the author was wrong in general, not just to the wife.\n\nAlso, consider the delivery person's perspective. They might be in a situation where they have to interact with many customers, and being put in a position where they feel uncomfortable could affect their job satisfaction or even safety. The author's actions, while not malicious, could contribute to an environment where the worker feels harassed or uneasy.\n\nHowever, some people might argue that it's a minor issue and that the delivery person should be professional enough to handle it. But the key point is that the author noticed the person's discomfort and felt guilty. That guilt suggests they recognize that maybe their actions weren't appropriate, even if they didn't intend to offend.\n\nIn terms of cultural context, there's a difference between being casual at home and how that's perceived when someone else is involved. Even if it's common to answer the door in underwear in some settings, when a delivery person is present, the expectation is to be somewhat dressed. Boxers are less covered than just a t-shirt, so maybe it's too revealing.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author likely is in the wrong. The delivery person's comfort and the author's own guilt after the incident indicate that it's better to be dressed more appropriately, even if it's just a quick answer. It's about respecting others' boundaries and avoiding unintentional discomfort. The answer should be A.\n"
