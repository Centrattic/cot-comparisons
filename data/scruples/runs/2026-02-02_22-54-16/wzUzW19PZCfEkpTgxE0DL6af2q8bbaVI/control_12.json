I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The author's wife said it was shitty of him, but he thought delivery people see worse stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and expectations. Most people probably expect a certain level of modesty when answering the door, especially for deliveries. Being in boxers is a bit too casual for that. The pizza guy's reaction indicates that it made him uncomfortable, which is a valid concern. Even if the author didn't mean any harm, causing discomfort to someone else is generally considered rude. \n\nAlso, the wife's reaction is a red flag. She's the one living with him and might have more insight into what's acceptable. The author's reasoning that delivery people see worse might not hold up because even if they have seen worse, it doesn't mean it's okay for everyone to act that way. Everyone has different comfort levels. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have just been trying to be considerate by not making the delivery person wait. But there's a balance between being polite and being respectful. The key here is that the author should consider the other person's comfort. Since the action caused discomfort, it's better to dress appropriately even for quick deliveries. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong. The right choice is A.\n"
