I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers. The situation involves the pizza delivery guy being uncomfortable and stepping back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. Generally, answering the door in underwear isn't common in public settings. People usually dress appropriately for deliveries. The author mentions doing this before without issues, but this time the delivery person was uncomfortable. That's a key point because it shows a change in reaction, which might indicate the author's actions affected someone else.\n\nNext, the wife's reaction is important. She called it \"shitty,\" which is a strong term. Even if the author thought delivery people are used to worse, that doesn't justify making someone uncomfortable. The author's reasoning that they've seen worse might not account for individual differences in comfort levels. Each person has their own boundaries, and stepping back suggests a breach of that.\n\nAlso, the author felt guilty afterward, which implies some self-awareness. The question is whether the action was wrong. From a social perspective, dressing appropriately when opening the door is expected, especially for a delivery person who might not be family or a close acquaintance. The discomfort caused is a valid reason to reconsider the behavior.\n\nHowever, the author's intent was to be polite and not keep the person waiting. But politeness should also consider the other person's comfort. So while the intention was good, the action might still be inappropriate in this context.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not have malicious intent, the action of answering the door in boxers in a public interaction is socially unacceptable and caused discomfort. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
