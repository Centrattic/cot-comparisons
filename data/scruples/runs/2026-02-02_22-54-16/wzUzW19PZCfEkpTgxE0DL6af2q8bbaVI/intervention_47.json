I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers. The situation is that the author did this a few times before, but tonight the pizza guy seemed uncomfortable. The wife thinks it's shitty, but the author thought it's okay since pizza delivery people see worse.\n\nHmm. So, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let me break it down. First, the author's intention was to not be rude and save time. But the pizza guy was clearly uncomfortable. The wife's reaction adds another perspective. The author's reasoning was that delivery people have seen worse, so they wouldn't mind. But in this case, the employee felt uncomfortable. \n\nNow, legally, there's no law against answering the door in underwear. But socially, it's more about respect and the other person's comfort. The key here is that the employee felt physically uncomfortable and took steps back. That indicates that the author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, caused discomfort. Even if the author didn't intend to, causing someone else to feel uncomfortable can be considered inconsiderate.\n\nThe author's wife's criticism suggests that there's a social norm that dressing more appropriately, even at home, is better when answering the door for strangers. The author's past actions didn't cause issues before, but this instance did. So, maybe there's a change in the situation or the employee's reaction. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a bit nuanced. They didn't have bad intentions, but they might not have considered the employee's feelings enough. The employee's reaction shows that it's not just about what is acceptable, but also about how others perceive it. So, maybe the author should have thought twice about it. The wife's point is about being respectful, which the author might have overlooked. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether causing discomfort, even unintentionally, is considered wrong. Since the author is now aware that it can make the employee uncomfortable, continuing to do so might be inconsiderate. The author's reasoning about delivery people seeing worse is a generalization that doesn't account for individual reactions. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the specific employee's feelings in this case.\n"
