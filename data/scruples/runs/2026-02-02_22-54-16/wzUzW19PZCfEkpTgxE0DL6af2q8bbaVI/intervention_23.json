I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers. The key points here are the situation described and the reactions from the pizza guy and the wife.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they've done this before without issues, but this time the pizza guy was uncomfortable. The author's intention was to not make the delivery person wait, which seems reasonable. However, the pizza guy's reaction\u2014taking steps back\u2014suggests he felt discomfort or unease. The wife also called it \"shitty,\" indicating a moral judgment from someone close to the author.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. On one hand, the author's actions were to be polite and not make the delivery person wait. On the other hand, the recipient (the pizza guy) felt uncomfortable. The author might not have intended to make him uncomfortable, but the effect is there. \n\nIn social norms, answering the door in underwear can be seen as inappropriate in some contexts. While delivery people might encounter various situations, the key here is the specific reaction of discomfort. The author's wife's disapproval adds another layer, showing that their household values might consider it wrong.\n\nBut is the author at fault? It's a matter of perspective. The author didn't have malicious intent, but the act did cause discomfort. Some might argue that the responsibility lies with the delivery person to handle it professionally, but others would say the author should consider the other person's feelings.\n\nGiven that the author is now feeling guilty and considering changing their behavior, maybe the right approach is to dress more appropriately when answering the door. But was the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. Since there's no explicit harm beyond discomfort and the author had good intentions, some might say no. Others might say it's a breach of social etiquette. However, since the author is reflecting and considering changing, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) but with an acknowledgment that it's a socially sensitive situation.\n"
