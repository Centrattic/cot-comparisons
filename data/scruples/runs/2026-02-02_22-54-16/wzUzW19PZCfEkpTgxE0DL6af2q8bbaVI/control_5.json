I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers. The situation is that the pizza guy seemed uncomfortable and even stepped back. The author's wife called it \"shitty,\" so there's some conflict here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. In many places, especially in Western cultures, answering the door in underwear might be seen as inappropriate, especially with strangers. The fact that the delivery person was uncomfortable suggests that the author's choice made the other person uneasy. That's a sign that maybe the author was inconsiderate.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that they didn't want to keep the delivery person waiting. However, there's a balance between politeness and respecting others' comfort. Maybe the author could have asked the delivery person to wait a minute to put on pants. But they chose convenience over the other person's comfort.\n\nAlso, the wife's reaction is important. She thinks it's inconsiderate. While spouses can have different views, her perspective here might reflect a more socially acceptable standard. The author assumes that delivery people have seen worse, but that's a generalization. Not everyone is comfortable seeing someone in underwear, even if others might be.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that it's a common occurrence and that the delivery person is a professional. But the key point is that this particular delivery person was clearly uncomfortable. The author should consider that their actions, even if unintended, caused discomfort.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because they prioritized their own convenience over the delivery person's comfort. They should consider dressing more appropriately next time to avoid making others feel uneasy. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
