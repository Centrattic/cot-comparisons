I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who answered the door in boxers is in the wrong. The situation is that they answered the door for a pizza delivery guy in just their underwear. The pizza guy was uncomfortable and stepped back. The wife called it \"shitty\" of them. The person is wondering if they should start dressing more fully before answering the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Generally, answering the door in underwear isn't considered appropriate for strangers. People might feel embarrassed or uncomfortable, especially if it's unexpected. The pizza guy's reaction supports that\u2014stepping back and being uncomfortable. The wife's disapproval also adds weight to the idea that it's not the right thing to do.\n\nThen, there's the aspect of respect and professionalism. Delivery workers have a job to do, and their comfort matters. Even if the person didn't intend to offend, their actions affected the delivery guy. The argument that delivery people have seen worse might not justify it, as each situation is different. What one person has seen, another might not, leading to discomfort.\n\nThe person's reasoning was to avoid keeping the delivery person waiting. However, there are other ways to handle that, like putting pants on quickly or using a door viewer. The guilt they felt after suggests some awareness that it wasn't the best choice.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even if it's not a major issue, the person is in the wrong because they didn't consider the other person's comfort and acted in a way that caused distress. The answer should be A.\n"
