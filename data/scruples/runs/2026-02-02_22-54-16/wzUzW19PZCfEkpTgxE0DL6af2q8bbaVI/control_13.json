I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about answering the door in boxers for a pizza delivery person. The writer has done this before, but this time the delivery guy was uncomfortable. The wife said it was \"shitty\" of him, and now he's wondering if he should change his behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me break down the key points. The author answers the door in underwear when they don't have pants ready, thinking it's normal. They mention that delivery people have seen worse, so they didn't think twice. However, in this instance, the pizza guy was uncomfortable. The wife disapproves, and the author feels guilty.\n\nSo, the main issue here is societal norms and respect for others' comfort. Even if the author didn't intend to cause discomfort, the fact that the delivery person was visibly upset suggests that the action had a negative impact. The author's reasoning is based on the idea that delivery people are accustomed to seeing all sorts of things, but that's an assumption. Just because someone's job might expose them to various situations doesn't mean they appreciate or are unaffected by them. Additionally, the wife's disapproval adds another layer, as it's about mutual respect in a relationship.\n\nI should consider cultural context too. In many places, answering the door in underwear is considered inappropriate, especially for strangers. It's about respecting the other person's space and dignity. The author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate because they didn't take into account the delivery person's feelings. The fact that the pizza guy took steps back indicates he felt awkward or even violated in some way. \n\nHowever, the author's intention was to be polite by not making the delivery person wait. But politeness should also consider the other person's comfort. Maybe there's a balance between convenience and respect. The author's past actions (doing it before without issues) don't necessarily justify the current action if someone was uncomfortable. It's possible that the author should be more mindful and either dress up or use a peephole to check before opening the door.\n\nThe wife's reaction is significant. It shows that there's a personal expectation of behavior that the author didn't meet. Even if the author didn't think it was wrong before, the wife's disapproval and the delivery person's discomfort are valid reasons to reconsider the habit.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author's actions may have caused harm or discomfort to another person, which is generally considered wrong. The key here is the impact on others. Even if the author didn't mean to, the result was an uncomfortable situation. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider the other person's feelings and the situation wasn't appropriate.\n"
