I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author answers the door for a pizza delivery in boxers because they didn't have pants on and didn't want to keep the delivery person waiting. They mention that this has happened before without issues, but this time the pizza guy was uncomfortable. The wife criticized them for it, and the author is now questioning if they should dress more when answering the door.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No, not in the wrong). \n\nLet me consider both sides. On one hand, the author's intention was to be polite by not making the delivery person wait, which is understandable. Society often expects people to be decently dressed when opening their doors, but boxers are a type of underwear, so it's not entirely unreasonable if viewed as casual wear. However, the delivery person was visibly uncomfortable this time, which is a new factor. The author might not have considered that others might find it inappropriate or that it could make someone uncomfortable, even if they've done it before.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is following their own judgment based on past experiences where delivery people have seen worse. They might not see it as a big deal. The wife's criticism adds another layer, but the main question is about the author's responsibility. The key points here are intent, the reaction of the delivery person, and societal norms.\n\nSocietal norms can vary, but in many places, answering the door in underwear might be seen as disrespectful or unprofessional, even if the delivery person is used to it. The fact that the delivery person felt uncomfortable this time suggests that the author's action had a negative impact, even if unintentional. The author might not have malice, but they are still causing someone else discomfort. That could be seen as being in the wrong, even if minor.\n\nHowever, the author's actions were meant to be courteous by not making the delivery person wait. They might not have realized the delivery person's discomfort, which is why there's a question about whether they should start dressing more. The author's perspective is that they're being polite, but the outcome was negative. So, is the intention more important than the result?\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both intent and impact. If the impact was negative, even if unintended, the person might be considered at fault. The delivery person was clearly affected, so the author might be in the wrong for not considering that their attire could be an issue. But others might argue that it's a minor issue and the author isn't being malicious.\n\nI think the balance leans towards B (No), because the author's intent was good\u2014they didn't mean to offend\u2014but there's also an argument for A (Yes) because the action caused discomfort. However, since the author is now reflecting and considering changing their behavior, maybe the conclusion is that they're not in the wrong, but should be more mindful. The answer hinges on whether causing discomfort without intent is considered being in the wrong. In many AITA cases, unless there's a clear violation of a norm or harm, the person might not be in the wrong. So, I'm leaning towards B, the author isn't in the wrong, but should perhaps dress more appropriately in the future to avoid discomfort.\n"
