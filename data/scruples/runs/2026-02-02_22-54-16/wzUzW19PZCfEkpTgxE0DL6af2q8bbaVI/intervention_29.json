I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers. The situation is that the pizza guy was uncomfortable, physically stepped back, and the author's wife called it \"shitty\" of him. The author thought it wasn't a big deal because pizza delivery people see worse, but now feels guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many places, answering the door in underwear isn't typical, especially for strangers. The key here is that the delivery person was clearly uncomfortable. The author's intention was to not keep the person waiting, which is thoughtful, but the action might have been inconsiderate.\n\nThe author's wife's reaction is important. She might be indicating that it's not appropriate. Also, the delivery person's reaction (stepping back) suggests that the author's attire was a problem. Even if the author thought others have seen worse, that's not a valid excuse. The author's comfort shouldn't outweigh the delivery person's comfort.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. While the action might not be malicious, it's a matter of respect and consideration. The author should consider dressing appropriately when answering the door for strangers, even if they're just delivering something. The fact that the delivery person was uncomfortable indicates that the author's action was inconsiderate. So, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they should have thought about the other person's feelings and dressed appropriately.\n"
