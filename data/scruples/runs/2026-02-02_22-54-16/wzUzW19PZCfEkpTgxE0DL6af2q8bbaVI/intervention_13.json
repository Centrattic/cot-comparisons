I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for answering the door in his boxers. The situation is that the pizza guy was uncomfortable, and the wife called it \"shitty\" of him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and expectations. Opening the door in just boxers is pretty casual, but maybe some people might find that inappropriate. The pizza guy reacted by stepping back, which shows he was uncomfortable. The author's wife is upset, so there's a conflict in perspectives here.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, citing that pizza delivery people might see worse. That's a common argument, like how some people think delivery workers are used to seeing anything. But the key point here is the other person's reaction. Even if the delivery person has seen worse, if they're uncomfortable in this situation, maybe the author should consider that.\n\nAlso, the author's intention was to not be rude. He didn't want to keep the delivery person waiting, so he opened the door quickly. That shows good intentions, but actions can still be judged based on how they affect others. The question is whether the action crossed a line.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, some might say that being in a state of undress, even if it's just boxers, is not appropriate for opening the door for a stranger. Others might argue that it's a common occurrence and not a big deal. The fact that the delivery person was visibly uncomfortable suggests that maybe the author should adjust his behavior, even if he didn't mean to offend.\n\nThe wife's reaction adds another layer. If the wife is upset, it could affect their relationship. The author might need to consider her feelings as well, even if the delivery person's discomfort is a separate issue. But the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong, not just about the wife's opinion.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at the harm caused and the intent. The author didn't intend to be rude, but the result was someone's discomfort. So, even if it's a common occurrence, if the person on the receiving end is uncomfortable, maybe the author should change his approach. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the intention was good and it's a common situation, but some might argue A (in the wrong) due to the negative reaction. However, since the delivery person's reaction is a one-off and the author's actions were in good faith, the answer might be B.\n"
