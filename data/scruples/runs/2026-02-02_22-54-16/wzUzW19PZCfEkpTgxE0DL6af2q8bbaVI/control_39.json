I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers after a pizza delivery. The situation is that the pizza guy was uncomfortable and even stepped back. The author's wife called it \"shitty,\" and the author is now questioning if they should change their behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Generally, people might expect some level of modesty when answering the door for strangers. While wearing boxers is less revealing than being completely naked, it's still underwear. Most people would probably prefer to be dressed in at least some clothing when meeting someone at the door. The fact that the pizza guy was uncomfortable suggests that the situation made him uneasy, which the author might not have anticipated.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that delivery people have seen worse and wouldn't mind. But just because someone might have encountered worse doesn't mean they appreciate it every time. It's possible the pizza guy felt disrespected or that his time wasn't valued if the customer isn't dressed. Also, the author's wife's reaction indicates that this might be a cultural or household norm they should consider respecting.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for misinterpretation. Even if the author didn't mean any harm, the action could be seen as unprofessional or inappropriate by the recipient. The key here is the reaction of the other person. Since this time was different from previous instances, it's a sign that the author's actions had a negative impact on the pizza guy's comfort.\n\nSo, even if the author didn't intend to cause discomfort, the act of answering the door in boxers could be seen as inconsiderate. The author should probably take the time to dress more appropriately to avoid making others uncomfortable, especially since there's no necessity to be in such attire when opening the door for a service professional.\n"
