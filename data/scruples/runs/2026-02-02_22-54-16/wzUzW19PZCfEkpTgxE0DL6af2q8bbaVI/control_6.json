I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who answered the door in boxers is in the wrong. The situation is that they answered the door for the pizza guy in their boxers, and the guy was uncomfortable. The wife is upset, and the person is wondering if they should change their behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many cultures, answering the door in underwear isn't the most appropriate, especially when someone is there for a service. Delivery people might be used to seeing different things, but that doesn't mean it's okay. The key here is respect and considering others' comfort.\n\nThe pizza guy's reaction was physical\u2014stepping back and being uncomfortable. That suggests the situation made him uneasy. Even if the author didn't intend to offend, the effect was there. The wife's criticism adds another angle, showing that there's a perspective that this behavior is inconsiderate.\n\nThen there's the aspect of privacy and professionalism. Delivery people are there for a job, but they're still customers in a way. The author's action might be seen as violating a boundary. Even if the author is in their home, the interaction is public in a sense because it's a service transaction.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that they didn't want to keep the delivery person waiting and assumed they've seen worse. But just because someone has seen worse doesn't mean they want to see it. The author's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, might still be inappropriate.\n\nSo, the main points are: the effect on the delivery person's comfort, societal norms about dressing appropriately when answering the door, and respect for others' feelings. The author might be in the wrong because their actions, though maybe not malicious, caused discomfort and could be seen as disrespectful.\n"
