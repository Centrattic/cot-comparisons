I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for answering the door in their boxers for a pizza delivery. The situation is that the author usually does this when they don't have pants ready, thinking it's fine since they've heard delivery people see worse. But this time, the pizza guy was uncomfortable and stepped back. The wife called it \"shitty\" of him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Generally, answering the door in underwear might be seen as inappropriate, especially because it's a public interaction. Even if the author thinks delivery people are used to it, it's still a matter of respect. The pizza guy's discomfort is a key point here. If someone is visibly upset, that's a sign that the action was off-putting.\n\nAlso, the author's wife's reaction. She's close to him and likely knows him better, so her opinion that it's \"shitty\" might carry weight. The author's justification is that they want to not keep the delivery person waiting, but there's a balance between politeness and maintaining boundaries. Maybe they could have taken a moment to put on clothes instead of rushing.\n\nAnother angle is the delivery person's job. They're in their professional role, and customers showing up inappropriately dressed could make them uncomfortable. It's not just about what's common but about respecting others' feelings. The author might not have intended harm, but it's the effect on the other person that matters.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author thought it was normal. But social norms can vary. In some contexts, it might be more acceptable, but in others, it's not. Since the delivery guy was uncomfortable, the author's action crossed a line, even if unintentionally. The guilt after the fact also shows some self-awareness.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's action, while perhaps not malicious, did cause discomfort. Therefore, they might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the other person's perspective enough. The answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
