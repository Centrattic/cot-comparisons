I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers to a pizza delivery guy. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The person answers the door in their underwear when they don't have pants ready. They mention that they did this before without issues, but this time the delivery guy was uncomfortable. The wife called it \"shitty\" of them. The person is now questioning if they should dress up more.\n\nThe key points here are about social norms and respect for others' comfort. Even if the person didn't mean to offend, the delivery guy's reaction matters. The wife's criticism adds another layer, suggesting that the action was inconsiderate. \n\nIn many cultures, answering the door in underwear is generally considered inappropriate when someone is delivering goods or services. It's expected to be presentable, even if it's just to sign for a delivery. The person's reasoning that delivery people have seen \"worse\" might not excuse the discomfort caused in this instance. \n\nThe fact that the delivery guy took steps back and was clearly uncomfortable indicates that the situation crossed into making someone else feel uneasy. Even if the person didn't intend to, the effect is what's important here. The author's action, while perhaps habitual, may have been inconsiderate without realizing the other person's perspective. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer would likely lean towards A (the author is in the wrong). They should consider dressing appropriately to avoid making others uncomfortable, even if it's a minor inconvenience. The wife's feedback also suggests that there's a need for the author to be more mindful of social etiquette in such situations.\n"
