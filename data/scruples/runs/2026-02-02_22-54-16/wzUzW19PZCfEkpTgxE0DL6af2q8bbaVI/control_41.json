I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who answered the door in boxers was wrong. So the situation is they answered the door for a pizza delivery guy in just their boxers, and the guy seemed uncomfortable. The wife is upset, and the person is wondering if they should have dressed more.\n\nFirst, I need to think about societal norms. In many places, people might consider it inappropriate to answer the door in just undergarments, especially for someone you don't know. Privacy and modesty are important here. Even if the person thought delivery folks see worse, that doesn't mean it's acceptable. Making someone uncomfortable is still a problem, even if the person might be used to seeing various situations.\n\nThe key points here are the pizza guy's reaction\u2014he took steps back, which shows he felt uncomfortable. The person's wife also called it \"shitty,\" which indicates a concern from their partner. The person might not have intended to cause discomfort, but the effect is what matters here. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that if it's a common occurrence for delivery people and they're supposed to handle all sorts of situations, maybe it's not a big deal. But respect and consideration for others' comfort should be a priority. The person should consider that even if others have encountered worse, each individual interaction should be respectful. \n\nThe person's action might be seen as inconsiderate because they didn't think about how the delivery person would feel. Even if they didn't mean to be rude, the outcome was uncomfortable for the other person. The wife's reaction also shows that there's a social expectation to be more dressed when opening the door to strangers. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the other person's feelings and acted in a way that caused discomfort. The answer would lean towards A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
