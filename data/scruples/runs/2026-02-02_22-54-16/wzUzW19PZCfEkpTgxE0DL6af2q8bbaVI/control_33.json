I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for answering the door in their boxers for a pizza delivery. Their wife says it was shitty, but they thought pizza guys see worse.\n\nFirst, cultural norms matter here. In many places, answering the door in boxers isn't unusual, especially if it's a quick transaction. People often prioritize convenience, especially when they're home alone. The person didn't mean to offend; they just wanted to be polite and not keep the delivery person waiting.\n\nBut the delivery guy was clearly uncomfortable. That's a red flag. Even if it's common, it's important to consider others' feelings. The person might not have realized the impact of their actions. Maybe the delivery guy wasn't used to such situations or felt it was inappropriate. The person's wife's reaction also suggests that there's a different perspective here.\n\nHowever, the person didn't act with malice. They were trying to be courteous. The key point is whether the act itself is wrong. If someone is in their home and answers the door in underwear, it's their right, but it's also good to be considerate. The delivery person's discomfort might stem from personal boundaries, so the person should maybe dress more appropriately next time to avoid making others uneasy.\n\nBut is the person in the wrong? They didn't intend harm. However, they should consider the other person's feelings. The answer might depend on cultural context and personal boundaries. Since the delivery person was uncomfortable, the person might have crossed a line, even unintentionally. So, the answer could be A, but there's nuance. Alternatively, since it's a private home and they weren't being disrespectful, B could be argued. But the delivery person's reaction indicates that the person's action was inappropriate, so A makes sense here.\n"
