I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers. They mentioned doing this before when they didn't have pants ready, and usually no big reaction. But this time, the pizza guy was uncomfortable and stepped back. The wife said it was \"shitty\" of him to do that. He thought since pizza guys see worse, it's fine, but now he's questioning.\n\nSo, first, I need to decide if the author is wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's break it down.\n\nThe situation: answering the door in underwear. The author's reasoning is that they didn't want to keep the delivery person waiting. That's a consideration, but maybe there's a balance between politeness and respecting others' comfort.\n\nThe key points here are the pizza guy's reaction. He was clearly uncomfortable, took steps back. That's a sign that the author's action made him feel uneasy. The author's wife also thinks it's wrong. The author's previous assumption was that delivery people have seen worse, so it's okay. But maybe that's an incorrect assumption. Just because someone's job involves seeing a lot of things doesn't mean they should be exposed to this unnecessarily.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while there might not be a strict rule against it, being considerate of others' comfort is important. The author's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, caused someone discomfort. The author's wife's reaction suggests that there's a social expectation to dress appropriately when answering the door, even if it's just for a quick delivery.\n\nAlso, the author's guilt after the incident indicates a realization that maybe their action wasn't appropriate. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the action caused discomfort to another person, even if unintended, it's a valid reason to consider changing behavior.\n\nSo, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they failed to consider the other person's feelings and comfort, leading to an awkward situation. The author's assumption about delivery people being desensitized might not hold, and the wife's disapproval reinforces that. The author should probably start dressing more appropriately even for quick deliveries to avoid causing discomfort.\n"
