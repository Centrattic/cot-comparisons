I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers to a pizza delivery person.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they've done this before when they didn't have pants on and didn't want to keep the delivery person waiting. They thought it was okay because they assumed delivery people have seen worse. However, in this instance, the pizza guy was clearly uncomfortable and stepped back. The author's wife is upset and calls it \"shitty\" of him. Now the author is questioning if they should start dressing more appropriately.\n\nI need to consider societal norms and expectations. In many places, answering the door in underwear might be considered inappropriate, especially for someone outside the household like a delivery person. Even if the author didn't intend to offend, the reaction of the pizza guy shows that it made him uncomfortable. The key point here is that the author didn't consider the other person's feelings or the professional boundary. The wife's reaction also indicates that she sees it as a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to be polite by not making the delivery person wait. However, the method used (opening the door in boxers) might not align with what is socially acceptable. While the author might not be malicious, the action still caused discomfort, which is a valid concern.\n\nSo, even if the author didn't mean to offend, the action did cause discomfort. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the other person's perspective and the situation's appropriateness.\n"
