I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about answering the door in boxers for a pizza delivery person. The author mentions they've done this before without issues, but this time the pizza guy was uncomfortable. The wife criticized them for being \"shitty,\" and the author is wondering if they should start dressing more formally for deliveries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many places, it's common for people to answer the door in casual attire, especially for deliveries. The author isn't doing anything overtly inappropriate. The key point here is the pizza guy's discomfort. The author didn't intend to make the delivery person uncomfortable, and their reasoning is that delivery people likely see a lot of different situations. The wife's reaction might stem from a different perspective, perhaps being more conscious of how others might perceive the situation.\n\nBut then again, even if it's common, maybe there's a social expectation to dress more appropriately. Some might argue that it's disrespectful to a delivery person to see someone in underwear. However, the author is trying to be polite by not making the person wait. The act of answering quickly and not engaging further might mitigate any potential issue. The fact that the author felt guilty after the pizza guy's reaction shows they care about others' comfort.\n\nAnother angle: the pizza guy's reaction could be due to personal boundaries or workplace policies. Some delivery services might prefer customers to be dressed a certain way for safety or professionalism reasons. But the author didn't know about that, and it's speculative. \n\nThe author's main concern is whether they should change their behavior. The wife's criticism is a factor here. But the author's past actions without issues suggest that their approach is generally acceptable. The discomfort in this specific instance might be an outlier. \n\nSo, weighing it all, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They had good intentions, tried to be polite by not making the delivery person wait, and the situation might have been an exception. However, it's understandable that some people might find it awkward. The answer would lean towards B (not in the wrong) because their actions were well-meaning and in line with common practices, even if there was an unintended negative reaction.\n"
