I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for answering the door in boxers. Their wife says it's shitty, but they thought it's common for delivery people to see worse.\n\nFirst, consider social norms. Wearing underwear to the door might be seen as inappropriate because it's not typical attire for receiving guests. Even if delivery people are used to seeing various situations, it's still a public interaction, and modesty is generally expected.\n\nThe pizza guy showed discomfort, stepping back. That's a sign the person felt uncomfortable. It's respectful to consider others' comfort levels. The author's intention was to not make the delivery wait, but maybe they didn't think about the other person's perspective.\n\nThe wife's reaction adds weight. She's a close partner, so her opinion matters. Even if it's not illegal, it's about social etiquette and respect. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the delivery person's feelings and their partner's view. So, the answer is A.\n"
