I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who answered the door in their boxers to the pizza guy is in the wrong. The author has done this before without issues, but this time the delivery person was uncomfortable. The wife criticized the action, so the author is now questioning their behavior.\n\nFirst, the main points here: the author is in their underwear (boxers), answering the door for a delivery person. They did this because they didn't have pants ready and didn't want to keep the person waiting. The delivery guy this time reacted negatively, stepping back and seeming uncomfortable. The author tried to be quick, but felt guilty. The wife called it \"shitty\", leading to the question of whether the author is at fault.\n\nI need to consider social norms and respect. Generally, people expect a certain level of modesty when opening the door to strangers. While some might be desensitized to such situations (as the author mentions hearing stories from delivery workers), others may find it uncomfortable. The key here is the delivery person's reaction\u2014clearly, they felt uncomfortable. The author's action, while perhaps not malicious, could be seen as a breach of personal space or a lack of consideration for the delivery person's comfort.\n\nThe wife's reaction supports the idea that this is inappropriate. Even if the author thought it was acceptable before, the negative reaction from both the delivery person and their spouse suggests that there's a social expectation to be more dressed when opening the door to strangers. Boxers are not typically considered appropriate attire for answering the door to someone outside the household. It's a matter of respecting the other person's comfort and maintaining a level of decorum.\n\nHowever, the author's intention was to be polite by not keeping the delivery person waiting. But politeness should also include consideration of the other person's feelings. There's a balance between convenience and respect. The author might argue that it's a common occurrence, but the fact that the delivery person reacted negatively indicates that it's not universally acceptable. So, while the author might not be in the wrong in terms of intent, the action itself could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
