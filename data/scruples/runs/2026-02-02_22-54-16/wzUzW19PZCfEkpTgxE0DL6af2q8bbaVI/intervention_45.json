I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers. The situation involves the author answering the door in underwear a few times before, but this time the pizza guy was uncomfortable and took steps back. The author's wife called it shitty, and now the person is conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's intention was to be polite and not make the delivery person wait. They thought that since delivery people hear stories about worse, maybe it's okay. But this time, the delivery guy was clearly uncomfortable. The wife is upset. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Public nudity or semi-nudity in certain contexts can be considered inappropriate, especially when it causes discomfort. Even if the author didn't mean to offend, the reaction of the delivery person indicates that it was uncomfortable. The author's wife also disapproves. \n\nHowever, the author's reasoning was based on past experiences where they didn't notice negative reactions. They might not have realized the impact. But the fact that this time the delivery person reacted negatively shows that it's possible to affect someone negatively even if it's not common. \n\nCultural norms play a role here. In some places, answering the door in underwear isn't a big deal, but in others, it's seen as inappropriate. The key is that the delivery person felt uncomfortable. The author's action, while well-intentioned, caused discomfort to another person. That might make the author at least partially responsible. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to be polite and not make the person wait. The act itself isn't illegal or a serious violation of social norms, but the reaction of the delivery person is a valid concern. The author should consider changing their behavior to avoid causing discomfort, even if others might not mind. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not entirely. They didn't have malicious intent, but they should be more mindful of others' feelings. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's a need for self-reflection and adjustment in behavior based on the reaction.\n"
