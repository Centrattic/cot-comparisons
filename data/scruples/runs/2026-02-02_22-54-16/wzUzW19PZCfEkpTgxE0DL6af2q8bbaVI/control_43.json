I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who answered the door in their boxers is in the wrong. The situation is that they answered the door for a pizza delivery guy in just boxers, and the delivery person was uncomfortable. The wife is upset, and the person is wondering if they should have dressed more when answering the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many places, people often answer doors for deliveries in casual or minimal clothing, especially if they're home alone or it's late. But there's also a consideration of respect and professionalism. The pizza delivery guy might be there to do their job, and seeing a customer in underwear could be awkward or unprofessional for them. \n\nThe person's reasoning was that delivery people see worse, so it's not a big deal. But just because someone might be used to seeing various situations doesn't mean it's appropriate. It's about respecting their boundaries and comfort. The delivery guy's reaction\u2014stepping back\u2014shows he felt uncomfortable, which is a valid response.\n\nThe wife's reaction also points out that it's \"shitty\" of him, which adds a personal element. The user's habit of answering in underwear before might mean they didn't realize the impact. However, now that they've noticed the delivery guy's discomfort and the wife's disapproval, they might need to adjust their behavior.\n\nEthically, it's about considering others' feelings. Even if it's convenient for the person to answer quickly, the discomfort caused to the delivery person is a factor. The question is whether the person is in the wrong for not dressing appropriately before opening the door. The answer would lean towards yes because it's respectful to put on some clothing, even if it's just a robe or pants, to avoid making the delivery person uncomfortable. \n\nBut maybe there's a cultural or situational nuance. In some places, it's common, but the key here is the delivery person's reaction. If they were clearly affected, then the person should have taken the extra moment to dress. The user's habit might be something they need to correct to show respect for the delivery person's job and their comfort. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider the delivery person's comfort and the wife's perspective, and should take time to dress appropriately.\n"
