I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for answering the door in their boxers. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person answers the door for a pizza delivery in their boxers because they didn't have pants on and didn't want to keep the delivery person waiting. They mention that they've done this before without issues, but this time the pizza guy was uncomfortable. Their wife criticized them for it. The person is wondering if they should start dressing more appropriately for such instances.\n\nNow, to determine if they're in the wrong. The main points to consider are social norms, respect for others, and the impact on the delivery person. \n\nSocial norms vary, but generally, answering the door in underwear isn't considered appropriate for strangers. While it's common for people to be in casual attire at home, opening the door to someone outside the household in minimal clothing can be seen as unprofessional or disrespectful. The pizza guy's discomfort suggests that it made him uneasy, which is a valid reaction. The person's wife also thinks it's \"shitty,\" indicating that their actions might have been inconsiderate.\n\nThe person's reasoning is that delivery workers have seen worse, so they wouldn't mind. However, assuming others are desensitized doesn't justify making someone uncomfortable. Everyone has different thresholds for what they're comfortable seeing. The key here is that the delivery person showed clear signs of discomfort, so the person's actions had a negative impact.\n\nEven though the person didn't intend to offend, the action still caused discomfort. The question is whether the wrong lies in the action itself or the effect it had. Since the person's wife and the delivery guy both reacted negatively, it suggests that the author's actions were inconsiderate, even if unintentional. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the person could have taken a moment to put on pants, which is a small inconvenience compared to making someone uncomfortable. The argument that it's common for delivery people to encounter such situations doesn't excuse the individual's responsibility to respect others' boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the person is in the wrong because they disregarded the delivery person's comfort and their partner's opinion. The answer should be A.\n"
