I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person answered the door in boxers for a pizza delivery. They mention they've done it before and others didn't react, but this time the pizza guy was uncomfortable. The wife called it \"shitty,\" and the person is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: answering the door in underwear. It's a common enough scenario, but the key here is how the delivery person reacted. The person felt guilty after seeing the discomfort. The wife's reaction is another point\u2014she's upset, so maybe she thinks it's inappropriate. The person's reasoning is that delivery people have seen worse, but maybe that's assuming too much.\n\nNow, considering social norms. In many places, it's acceptable to answer the door in underwear if it's just a quick transaction, but if someone is visibly uncomfortable, maybe it's better to cover up. The person is trying to be polite by not keeping the delivery person waiting, which is understandable. However, the discomfort shown by the employee suggests that their actions might have made the worker feel uneasy or disrespected. \n\nThe question is whether the person is in the wrong. The answer depends on cultural and personal boundaries. If the employee felt uncomfortable, then the person might have overstepped, even if unintentionally. The wife's criticism adds another layer, indicating that maybe in their household or social context, this is seen as inappropriate. \n\nBut on the other hand, the person didn't have pants ready and acted quickly. It's a minor situation, and expecting someone to dress fully for a quick delivery might be seen as overreacting. However, considering the other party's comfort is important. Since the pizza guy reacted negatively, perhaps the person should adjust their behavior to avoid making others uncomfortable, even if they think it's harmless.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong not because of the act itself, but because it caused discomfort. However, if it's a one-time thing and the person is now considering changing their behavior, maybe not. But the wife's perspective is valid. The answer could lean towards A (Yes) because causing discomfort to another person is a valid concern. Alternatively, B (No) if it's seen as a minor, common situation where the person was trying to be polite.\n"
