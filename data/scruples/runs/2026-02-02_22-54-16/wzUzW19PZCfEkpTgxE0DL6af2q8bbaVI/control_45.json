I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for answering the door in their boxers. The question is a classic \"Am I the asshole?\" situation.\n\nThe author's situation is that they answered the door in their underwear because they didn't have pants on and didn't want to make the pizza guy wait. They mention that in the past, they haven't noticed any negative reactions, but this time the delivery person was uncomfortable. Their wife criticized them for it, and now they're wondering if they should change their behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and expectations. Generally, when someone comes to your door, especially strangers, it's considered polite to be dressed appropriately. While some people might be more laid-back, others could feel uncomfortable or even offended. The key here is that the pizza guy showed discomfort, which the author noticed. This suggests that their action, while maybe not malicious, did cause someone else to feel uneasy.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that delivery people have probably seen worse, so they might not mind. However, just because someone might be accustomed to seeing various situations doesn't mean they don't feel uncomfortable in certain scenarios. The author's wife also expressed disapproval, which adds a perspective that their action was indeed inconsiderate.\n\nIt's important to note that the author's intent wasn't to be rude; they just wanted to be efficient. However, the impact on the delivery person matters here. Even if the author didn't mean to cause discomfort, the fact that they did so means they should consider changing their behavior. The question is about whether they're in the wrong, not just about intent.\n\nIn social situations, we're often expected to consider how our actions affect others. Even if the author hasn't had issues before, the fact that this instance caused discomfort is a sign that their actions might be inappropriate in some contexts. The wife's reaction also validates the concern. So, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the other person's feelings and for not adjusting their behavior after noticing the discomfort.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their action, while perhaps not malicious, caused discomfort to the delivery person and was criticized by their spouse, indicating that it's not socially acceptable in this context.\n"
