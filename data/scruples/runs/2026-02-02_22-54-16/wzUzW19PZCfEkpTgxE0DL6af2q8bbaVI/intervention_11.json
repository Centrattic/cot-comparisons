I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers when the pizza guy was uncomfortable. The author has done this before, thinking it's okay because delivery people probably see worse. The wife is upset, and the author is now feeling guilty.\n\nHmm. The key points here are societal norms, respect for others, and the spouse's opinion. The author's reasoning is that it's a quick delivery and they'd feel rude keeping the person waiting. But the pizza guy's reaction was uncomfortable, so maybe the author didn't consider that different people have different comfort levels. Even if the author didn't mean to cause discomfort, the fact that it did happen could be a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to be considerate by not making the delivery person wait for them to get fully dressed. But maybe in this case, the delivery person's discomfort is valid, and the author should be more mindful of how they present themselves. The wife's reaction is also a factor\u2014partners often have a say in what's acceptable in the home. \n\nI think it's a matter of perspective. The author might not be \"in the wrong\" in terms of intent, but in terms of action, opening the door in minimal clothing might be seen as inconsiderate in some contexts. The answer would likely be B (No), because the author's intention was to be polite, but there's room for adjustment in the future. However, some might argue that it's still inappropriate regardless of intent. The wife's opinion adds a layer where the household's standards matter. But generally, unless there's a specific rule against it, it's a situational thing. So probably B.\n"
