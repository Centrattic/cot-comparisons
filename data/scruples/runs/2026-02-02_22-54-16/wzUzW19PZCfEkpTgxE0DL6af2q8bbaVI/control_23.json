I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for answering the door in their boxers for the pizza guy. The situation is that the pizza guy seemed uncomfortable, and the author's wife criticized them for it. The author usually does this when they can't find pants and wants to avoid making the delivery person wait.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were inappropriate. The key points here are cultural norms, respect for others, and the specific reaction of the pizza guy. In many places, especially in Western cultures, it's common for people to answer the door in their underwear or pajamas if they're at home and in a hurry. However, the delivery person might have a different perspective. The author mentions that the pizza guy took steps back, indicating discomfort. That's a sign that the attire was not appropriate from the delivery person's viewpoint.\n\nThe author's wife thinks it's \"shitty\" to do that, which suggests a familial perspective. The author's reasoning is that delivery people often see worse, so they might not mind. But even if that's true, the individual reaction here was negative. The author might have assumed that since others don't mind, it's okay, but each person's comfort level is different. The act of answering the door in minimal clothing could be considered disrespectful or inappropriate in some contexts, especially if it causes the other person discomfort.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intent was to be polite and not make the delivery person wait. There's a balance between personal convenience and respecting others' boundaries. The key here is whether the action crossed a line. Since the pizza guy was clearly uncomfortable, it might be reasonable to conclude that the author should have dressed more appropriately. The author's wife's criticism adds another layer, indicating that maybe the author should consider the perspective of others more carefully.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they caused discomfort and should have put on pants even if it took a bit more time. The assumption that delivery people are desensitized to such situations doesn't justify making someone else uncomfortable. Therefore, the correct choice is A.\n"
