I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that he answered the door in his boxers for a pizza delivery guy, and the guy was uncomfortable. His wife criticized him, and now he's wondering if he should have dressed more before answering the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. In many places, it's common for people to answer the door in casual attire, especially for deliveries. However, the key point here is that the delivery person was uncomfortable. Even if it's common, if someone feels uncomfortable, that's a valid concern. The author's wife also disapproved, which adds another layer of perspective.\n\nThe author mentions that he thought delivery people see worse, so maybe he felt it was okay. But that's an assumption. Just because someone's job requires them to interact with the public doesn't mean they should have to tolerate things that make them uncomfortable. The delivery guy's reaction (stepping back) suggests that he felt out of his comfort zone. \n\nAlso, the act of answering the door in underwear, while perhaps not illegal or a huge social faux pas, might be seen as disrespectful or unprofessional by some. The author's wife's reaction indicates that there's a social expectation to present oneself more modestly when receiving deliveries. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is balancing between being polite and not wanting to keep the delivery person waiting. There's a consideration of time and convenience here. But the discomfort caused to the delivery person is a significant factor. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, even if the author didn't intend to make the delivery person uncomfortable, the effect is still real. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not considering the delivery person's feelings. Since the delivery person was clearly affected, the author might be seen as in the wrong for not taking into account the other person's comfort level. \n\nThe wife's disapproval also plays a role. It's possible that she's pointing out a social norm the author was previously unaware of. The author's assumption that delivery people see worse might not account for individual sensitivities. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author made a mistake by not dressing appropriately, even if it's common. The discomfort caused to the delivery person and the wife's disapproval suggest that the author is in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes).\n"
