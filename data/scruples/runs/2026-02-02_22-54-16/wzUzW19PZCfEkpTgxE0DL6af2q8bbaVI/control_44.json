I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who answered the door in their boxers was in the wrong. The situation is that they did this to avoid keeping the pizza guy waiting, but the delivery person was uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Wearing just boxers at home is common, but when answering the door, especially for someone outside the household, it's generally expected to be more dressed. Even if the person is in their own home, the door is the public space. So, from a social etiquette perspective, people usually dress appropriately for visitors, whether it's friends, delivery, etc. \n\nThe pizza guy's reaction was discomfort and stepping back. That suggests the situation made him uneasy, which the author later feels guilty about. The wife also criticized the action as \"shitty,\" which is a personal opinion but indicates that some people see it as inconsiderate.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that delivery people have seen worse, so it's okay. But that's a flawed assumption. Just because someone might have encountered more extreme situations doesn't mean they appreciate being exposed to any level of discomfort. It's about respecting others' comfort and boundaries. \n\nThere's also the aspect of respect. Even if it's a brief interaction, showing up in boxers could be seen as disrespectful to the delivery person's time and professionalism. It's a small act that can affect someone's job satisfaction or create an uncomfortable work environment.\n\nHowever, there's a counter-argument: it's a private home, and the person isn't obligated to dress for unknown visitors. But the key here is the impact on others. The author acknowledges the discomfort caused, which is a red flag. Social norms often prioritize minimizing others' discomfort, even if it's a minor inconvenience.\n\nIn conclusion, while the action isn't a crime, social norms and consideration for others' feelings suggest that the author's actions were inconsiderate. The right choice would be to dress more appropriately for answering the door, even if it's just for a delivery. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
