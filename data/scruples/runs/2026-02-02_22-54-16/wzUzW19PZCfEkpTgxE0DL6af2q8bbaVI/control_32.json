I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers to a pizza delivery guy. The wife called it \"shitty,\" and the pizza guy was uncomfortable. The author's reasoning is that since delivery people have seen worse, maybe it's okay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Answering the door in underwear is generally not considered appropriate in front of strangers, even if they're delivering pizza. While some people might be more relaxed, the key here is that the pizza guy reacted with discomfort. That suggests the situation was unprofessional or made him feel uneasy. The author might have assumed that because they've done it before without issues, it's always okay. But the fact that this time the person was uncomfortable shows that it's not universally acceptable. \n\nAlso, the wife's reaction is important. She's likely the one who would be affected if the author were in a relationship where such actions are frowned upon. The author's responsibility to respect others' comfort levels is a social expectation. Even if the author didn't intend to cause discomfort, the action had that effect. \n\nThen there's the argument that delivery people see a lot. Maybe that's a common excuse, but it's not a valid one. Everyone should be treated with basic respect and professionalism. The author is in their own home, but the delivery person is a professional worker who should not be subjected to inappropriate situations. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A. The author is in the wrong because they compromised the delivery person's comfort, even if unintentionally. It's better to dress appropriately, even for quick interactions, to maintain professionalism and respect. The wife's perspective and the delivery guy's reaction both indicate that the behavior was not acceptable. The author should consider changing their habit to avoid making others uncomfortable.\n"
