I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is they answered the door in their boxers for the pizza guy. They mention they've done it before without issues, but this time the delivery person was uncomfortable. The wife is upset, and the author is now questioning their behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and etiquette. Generally, when someone is in your home or at your door, it's considered polite to be presentable. Answering the door in underwear isn't common and might be considered inappropriate, especially if it makes the other person uncomfortable. The author's reasoning is that they didn't want to keep the delivery person waiting, but there's a balance between politeness and maintaining respect for the other person's comfort.\n\nThe key points here are the reaction of the pizza guy and the wife's judgment. The guy took steps back and seemed physically uncomfortable, which indicates that the author's actions crossed a line. The wife's criticism adds another layer, suggesting that the action was indeed inappropriate. The author's prior assumption that delivery people are used to worse might be a defense mechanism, but it doesn't negate the current situation where someone was actually affected by it.\n\nAlso, considering respect and professionalism, even if the delivery person is in a service role, the customer should maintain a certain level of decorum. The author's actions might have made the delivery person feel objectified or disrespected, which is a valid concern. The guilt the author feels now shows they recognize that something was off, even if they didn't see it initially.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions likely made the delivery person uncomfortable, which is a valid reason to consider that they were in the wrong. Even if it wasn't intentional, the impact is what matters here. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
