I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers. The scenario is that the author, on multiple occasions, has answered the door in underwear when they didn't have pants ready, not thinking much of it. This time, the pizza guy was uncomfortable and stepped back. The wife is upset, and the author is wondering if they should start dressing more when answering the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around answering the door in underwear. In many cultures, it's common for people to wear underwear at home, especially if they're in a hurry. However, when opening the door to someone outside the home, like a delivery person, there's a social expectation to present oneself appropriately. The key here is whether the author's actions were respectful and considerate.\n\nThe author mentions that they thought pizza delivery people have seen worse, so they wouldn't mind. But this time, the delivery person was clearly uncomfortable. The reaction of the delivery person is a sign that the author's choice to open the door in boxers was not respectful to the other person. The wife's reaction also indicates that the author's actions were seen as inappropriate by someone close to them.\n\nHowever, the author's intention wasn't malicious. They just wanted to be polite and not make the delivery person wait. The question is about whether the action itself is wrong, not the intention. Social norms often prioritize the comfort of others, so even if the author didn't mean to offend, the act of showing up in underwear might be considered inconsiderate in some contexts.\n\nIn some places, it's more acceptable to wear underwear at home, but when interacting with others, especially strangers, dressing appropriately is expected. The delivery person's discomfort is a valid reaction, so the author's action might be seen as inconsiderate. However, others might argue that it's a minor issue, and the author isn't in the wrong for not anticipating the delivery person's reaction.\n\nI also need to consider if there's a cultural aspect. In some cultures, it's more relaxed about what people wear at home, while others have stricter norms. The answer might depend on where the author is located. But since the question is general, I should focus on the general social norms that are widely accepted.\n\nThe author's wife is upset, which is a personal relationship issue. The author might be in the wrong here because the wife's perspective is that it's \"shitty\" of them, implying that the action is disrespectful. The author's habit of doing this before might have been okay in the past, but the delivery person's reaction suggests that it's not always acceptable.\n\nIn conclusion, even though the author's intention was to be polite by not making the delivery person wait, the act of opening the door in boxers could be seen as inconsiderate because it made the delivery person uncomfortable. The right approach is to consider how others might feel and dress appropriately when answering the door, even if it's just for a quick interaction. So, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the delivery person's comfort.\n"
