I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who answered the door in their boxers was wrong. The situation is that they did this a few times before, but this time the pizza guy was uncomfortable and stepped back. The wife is upset, and the person is questioning if they should start dressing more before answering the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. Generally, people might expect that when someone answers the door for delivery, they should be dressed appropriately. But what's considered appropriate can vary. Boxers might be considered underwear, and some might see that as indecent, depending on the culture or region.\n\nThen, the reaction of the pizza guy is a key point. He was clearly uncomfortable, even physically stepping back. That indicates he found it unacceptable or offensive. The person's wife also called it \"shitty,\" which adds another perspective from someone close to them. \n\nThe argument the person makes is that they thought delivery people have seen worse and wouldn't mind. But just because someone's job involves dealing with various situations doesn't mean they are okay with everything. It's about respecting others' boundaries and comfort levels. Making someone uncomfortable, even if unintentionally, is a form of disrespect. \n\nAnother angle is the intention. The person didn't do it to offend, just to be polite by not making the delivery wait. However, the consequence of their action caused discomfort. The responsibility here might be on the person to adjust their behavior to avoid causing others distress, even if it's unintentional.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, answering the door in underwear is generally discouraged in many social settings. It's seen as unprofessional and could be considered impolite. The fact that this is a delivery person who is doing their job and needs to maintain professional boundaries also matters. They shouldn't have to deal with a client being inappropriately dressed.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's action caused discomfort, the wife disapproves, and societal norms suggest dressing appropriately when answering the door for deliveries. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not considering the other person's comfort and professional setting.\n"
