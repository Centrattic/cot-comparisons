I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're at fault for answering the door in their boxers for the pizza guy. They've done it before without issues, but this time the delivery person was uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They mention not having pants ready and wanting to avoid being rude. But the delivery guy's reaction was strong, taking steps back. The wife called it \"shitty,\" which suggests she doesn't approve. \n\nThe key points here are about social norms and respect for others. Even if the person didn't intend to cause discomfort, the fact that the delivery person was clearly affected means it's not just about their personal comfort but also how their actions impact others. \n\nDelivery workers are professionals doing their job, and while they might be used to seeing various things, that doesn't mean it's appropriate to ignore their comfort. The author's reasoning that they've seen worse might be true, but that's not an excuse to make someone else feel uneasy. \n\nThe wife's reaction is also important. She's a close partner, and her disapproval might be based on empathy for the delivery person's feelings. It's possible the author didn't consider that their brief moment of convenience could be intrusive or disrespectful to others. \n\nIn public interactions, especially with strangers, it's generally expected to present oneself in a respectful manner. Wearing just boxers might be considered too casual or immodest for someone at the door, especially if it causes discomfort. \n\nSo, even if it's not a huge issue, the author should probably start dressing more appropriately to avoid making others uncomfortable. The answer would be that they are in the wrong (A) because their actions disregarded the delivery person's feelings, even if unintended.\n"
