I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for answering the door in his boxers. Let me start by going through the situation again. The person answers the door for the pizza guy while wearing just boxers because they didn't have pants ready. They mention they've done this before and others didn't react much, but this time the pizza guy was uncomfortable and stepped back. After feeling guilty, the wife criticized them for it. The person is now questioning if they should start dressing more appropriately.\n\nFirst, I should consider the general social norms around answering the door in underwear. In many places, especially in Western cultures, answering the door in underwear isn't uncommon, but it's usually expected that the person is aware of their surroundings and the potential reactions. However, the key here is the reaction of the pizza delivery person. The fact that he was uncomfortable and stepped back indicates that the situation made him uneasy. The author tried to end the interaction quickly, but the guilt suggests they recognize a possible issue.\n\nNow, the wife's reaction is also a point to consider. She called it \"shitty\" of the author, which implies she believes it's inconsiderate or rude. The author's justification is that they've heard delivery people see worse, so they thought it wasn't a big deal. But maybe that's a flawed assumption because each delivery person has their own comfort level and boundaries. The author might not have considered that even though some people might not mind, others could find it offensive or uncomfortable.\n\nFrom a societal perspective, answering the door in underwear is often seen as a minor social faux pas, but it's also context-dependent. If the person is in their home and the visitor is a delivery person, the expectation might be lower than if someone were to open the door in underwear for a friend or neighbor. However, the discomfort shown by the delivery person here is significant. The author's action, while perhaps not malicious, still caused someone to feel uneasy, which is a valid concern.\n\nAnother angle is respect and consideration for others. Even if the author didn't intend to offend, the act of being partially clothed in front of someone else could be seen as a lack of respect for the delivery person's space and comfort. The author is prioritizing their own convenience (not waiting to put on pants) over the delivery person's comfort. The wife's criticism highlights that this is inconsiderate.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is being too self-critical, especially since they've done this before without issues. The difference here is the delivery person's reaction. It's possible that the author is overthinking, but since the situation did cause discomfort, it's reasonable to question their actions. The key points here are the immediate reaction of the delivery person and the wife's disapproval. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the potential for causing discomfort. While it's a common practice for some, it's not universally acceptable. The author should perhaps adjust their behavior to avoid making others uncomfortable, even if it means taking a few extra minutes to dress. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's action, though perhaps not malicious, did cause discomfort to the delivery person. The wife's reaction is valid in pointing out that it's inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the delivery person's perspective and boundaries.\n"
