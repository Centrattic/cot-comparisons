I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers. The situation is that the pizza delivery guy seemed uncomfortable, and the wife called it \"shitty\" of him. The author's reasoning was that they didn't want to keep the delivery person waiting and thought they've seen worse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms here. Answering the door in underwear is generally considered inappropriate. Even if the person didn't intend to be rude, it's a common courtesy to be dressed when answering the door for strangers. The fact that the delivery guy took a step back shows he was uncomfortable, which the author should have noticed and taken responsibility for.\n\nThe author's wife's reaction is also a point to consider. She's his partner and would have a valid perspective on this. Her disapproval suggests that this might be a recurring issue, and maybe the author hasn't been considering others' feelings previously.\n\nThe author's defense is that he thought delivery people have seen worse. While that might be true, it's not an excuse. Everyone has different comfort levels. Just because someone has seen worse doesn't mean they want to see someone in underwear. It's about respecting the other person's boundaries and comfort.\n\nAlso, the author mentions doing this before without issues, but this time it was different. The key here is that it's not about whether the delivery person minds or not, but about the author's responsibility to present themselves respectfully. It's a matter of common courtesy and respect for others' feelings.\n\nSo, overall, the author is in the wrong. They should have taken the time to put on pants, even if it was just for a minute, to avoid making the delivery person uncomfortable. The wife's reaction and the delivery guy's discomfort both indicate that the action was inappropriate.\n"
