I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they answered the door in their boxers for a pizza delivery guy. Their wife is upset, and the pizza guy was clearly uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many places, especially in more conservative areas, answering the door in underwear might be considered inappropriate. The key here is that the delivery person was uncomfortable. The author mentions they've done this before but never noticed a strong reaction until now. However, this time was different because the guy took steps back, indicating significant discomfort.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they didn't want to keep the delivery person waiting and thought that delivery people have seen worse. But maybe that's not a valid justification. Even if someone has seen worse, it doesn't mean they want to see it. The person's reaction shows that they were uncomfortable, which is a valid reason to reconsider the action.\n\nAlso, the wife's reaction is important. She considers it \"shitty\" of him. While the wife's opinion might be subjective, it's part of the social context here. The author might not have considered the potential embarrassment or violation of personal space that the delivery person felt. \n\nAnother angle is respect and professionalism. Delivery people are doing a job, and while they might be used to a variety of situations, showing up in underwear could be seen as disrespectful or unprofessional on the part of the customer. It's about setting boundaries and considering the other person's comfort.\n\nSo, even if the author has done it before without issues, this instance shows that someone was genuinely uncomfortable. The fact that the author started feeling guilty after the fact suggests they recognize that there might be something wrong with their action. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the delivery person's comfort and potentially caused them distress. The justification of not wanting to keep them waiting isn't enough if it makes the delivery person uncomfortable. The correct approach would be to either wait until dressed or ensure they are appropriately clothed when opening the door.\n"
