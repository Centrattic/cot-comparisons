I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for answering the door in their boxers. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author sometimes answers the door in underwear when they don't have pants ready, saying they don't want to keep the delivery person waiting. They mention that a pizza guy was uncomfortable and stepped back. The wife said it was shitty, but the author thought delivery people have seen worse and wouldn't mind. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, from a social etiquette perspective, answering the door in underwear is generally considered inappropriate. Even if the delivery person is expected to see various situations, it's still respectful to cover up. The key point is respect for others' comfort. The pizza guy's reaction shows he was uncomfortable, which the author noticed and felt guilty. The wife's disapproval also suggests that the author's actions were socially unacceptable.\n\nAnother angle is the delivery person's job. They are doing their job and might encounter different situations, but that doesn't mean they should be subjected to something they find uncomfortable. The author's previous assumption that they've seen worse might not account for individual differences in what people find acceptable. Just because one person might be okay with it doesn't mean everyone else will be.\n\nThe author's intention was to be polite by not keeping the delivery person waiting, but the result was making the person uncomfortable. There's a balance between politeness and respecting others' boundaries. The solution might be to take a moment to put on something more appropriate to avoid making others uncomfortable, even if it's just a brief moment.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's actions directly caused the discomfort. While it's a minor issue, it's still about considering others' feelings. The wife's reaction indicates that this is a point of contention in their relationship, so the author might benefit from changing their behavior to avoid similar situations.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong because their actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, caused discomfort to the delivery person and violated social norms about appropriate attire when opening doors.\n"
