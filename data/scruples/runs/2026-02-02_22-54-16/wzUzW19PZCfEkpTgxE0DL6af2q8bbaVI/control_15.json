I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who answered the door in their boxers is in the wrong. The situation is that they've done this before with no issues, but this time the pizza guy was uncomfortable. The wife is upset, and the person is wondering if they should start dressing more properly.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The person's reasoning is that they didn't want to keep the delivery person waiting and thought that since delivery workers see worse, it's okay. However, this time the delivery person was visibly uncomfortable. The wife is upset, and the person is now feeling guilty.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a social etiquette perspective, answering the door in underwear or just a boxers might be seen as inappropriate. Most people would expect to be dressed when answering the door for someone at their doorstep. Even if the delivery person is used to seeing various situations, it's still the customer's home, and the delivery person might feel uncomfortable regardless of their experience.\n\nThe key factors here are intent and the other person's reaction. The author's intent was good\u2014they didn't want to make the delivery person wait. However, the delivery person's discomfort suggests that the situation was inappropriate. The wife's reaction also indicates that there's a social expectation to be dressed when answering the door, which the author didn't consider.\n\nEven though the author might have thought it was fine before, the fact that this time it caused discomfort shows that it's not always acceptable. There's a balance between convenience and respecting others' comfort. Since the delivery person's job is to serve customers, they might not want to see something they're not comfortable with, even if they've seen worse. The author should consider dressing appropriately to avoid making others uncomfortable. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
