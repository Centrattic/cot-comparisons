I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers for a pizza delivery person. The author has done this before, thinking it's okay because they don't want to keep the delivery person waiting. But this time, the delivery guy was uncomfortable and stepped back. The wife is upset, and the author is questioning their actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Answering the door in underwear isn't typically considered appropriate when someone is delivering something. Even if the person is a delivery guy, they're still a stranger, albeit a service worker. The key here is respect and consideration for others' comfort levels.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that delivery people probably see worse and wouldn't mind, but that's a generalization. Just because some delivery people might be desensitized doesn't mean all are. In this case, the delivery guy clearly felt uncomfortable. The author's actions, while perhaps habitual, caused someone else distress, which is a valid point. \n\nThe wife's reaction adds another layer. She thinks it's \"shitty\" of the author, which suggests that in her view, the action was inconsiderate. The author's perspective is that they were trying to be polite by not making the delivery person wait, but that logic might not hold up if the action causes discomfort. \n\nThere's also the aspect of personal boundaries. The author might not see the delivery person as a stranger, but they still are. Opening the door in minimal clothing can be seen as a breach of personal space and respect for the other person's experience. \n\nSo, even if the author didn't intend to offend, the outcome was that the delivery person was uncomfortable. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The action itself might not be inherently wrong, but the impact on the delivery person's comfort and the wife's disapproval suggest that the author should consider changing their behavior. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, dressing appropriately for visitors, even if they're just delivering something, is generally expected. The author's habit might be seen as careless or disrespectful. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because their actions disregarded the delivery person's feelings and the expectation of being dressed when receiving services.\n"
