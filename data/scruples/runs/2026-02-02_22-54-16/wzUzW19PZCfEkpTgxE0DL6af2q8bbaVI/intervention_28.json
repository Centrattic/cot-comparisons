I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers. The situation is that the pizza guy was uncomfortable and took steps back when the door was opened. The author's wife said it was \"shitty\" of him, but he thought it was okay because delivery people see worse and he didn't want to make them wait.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many places, answering the door in underwear is generally seen as inappropriate, especially for a delivery person. The author's reasoning that delivery people have seen worse might be true, but that doesn't necessarily justify the action. The key here is the reaction of the pizza guy being uncomfortable. The author's wife is upset, which adds another layer.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to assess if there's a cultural context or specific factors. In some cultures, being in underwear at home is more accepted, but when it comes to interactions with strangers, especially service workers, modesty is usually expected. The fact that the author didn't consider the other person's comfort until after the fact might be a point against him. Also, the wife's criticism suggests there's a relationship dynamic here where the author might be expected to dress more appropriately for deliveries.\n\nAnother angle: the author's intention was to be polite by not making the delivery wait, but the method (answering in boxers) might conflict with that intention. The pizza guy's discomfort indicates that the action was indeed unprofessional or awkward for the recipient. The author's guilt after the fact shows some self-awareness, but the question is whether it was wrong.\n\nConsidering all this, while the author didn't mean to be rude, the act of answering the door in boxers could be seen as inappropriate. The answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because even if the delivery person has seen worse, the author should respect the service worker's comfort and social norms. However, some might argue B (not wrong) if the author had no malicious intent and it's a common occurrence. But the discomfort expressed by the delivery person and the wife's disapproval likely tip the scales towards A.\n"
