I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who answered the door in their boxers is in the wrong. The situation is that they answered the door for a pizza delivery guy in their boxers, and the delivery person was uncomfortable. The wife is upset, and the person is questioning if they should have dressed more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. Generally, people might answer the door in casual clothing when they're at home, especially for deliveries. But boxers are undergarments, so maybe that's crossing a line. The key here is that the delivery person was physically uncomfortable, which suggests that it made him uneasy. The user mentioned that they thought delivery people have seen worse, but maybe that's not a valid assumption. It's possible that even if some have experienced more, each person has their own comfort level. The user's wife is also criticizing them, which adds another layer of social pressure. \n\nAnother angle is respect for others' comfort. Even if it's a common occurrence, if someone is made to feel uncomfortable, then perhaps the action is inappropriate. The user might not have intended to cause discomfort, but the effect is there. The question is whether the action itself is wrong regardless of intent. \n\nAlso, considering the delivery person's job, they might be in a position where they have to interact with various customers, but that doesn't mean they should be subjected to situations that make them uncomfortable. The user could have simply asked the delivery person to wait a moment while they put on pants. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's a minor issue and that the user was just trying to be polite by not making the delivery person wait. However, the discomfort experienced by the delivery person seems to outweigh that. The user's wife's reaction also indicates that there's a social expectation to dress appropriately when answering the door, especially if someone is waiting. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user's action was unintentional but caused discomfort. So, the user might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the other person's feelings and could have taken a few seconds to dress before opening the door. Hence, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
