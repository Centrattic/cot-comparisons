My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about cooking separate meals. The author doesn't want to make separate meals because their husband has different preferences. The husband eats heavy meals, doesn't like vegetables, and even throws away food he doesn't like. The author feels like they're the asshole because they make food he doesn't want, leading to waste, and they're trying to eat healthier.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main points: they want to eat healthier, don't want to cook two meals, and are frustrated that their husband wastes food. The husband's side: he likes heavy meals, isn't adventurous, and doesn't want to eat what the author makes. They mention that he throws away food when he doesn't like it, which adds to the problem.\n\nNow, common situations like this usually involve shared responsibilities in cooking. If one partner wants to eat differently, perhaps they can find compromises. But the husband isn't open to trying new things and is causing waste. The author is making an effort to avoid making food that will be thrown away, but it's affecting the author's own dietary needs. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the husband is resistant to eating healthier or different meals, the author isn't wrong for not wanting to cook for his preferences. The husband's behavior of wasting food is problematic. The author is trying to balance both their needs but is stuck because he doesn't reciprocate. \n\nSo, the key points are whether the author is unreasonable for not cooking two meals. Typically, in relationships, couples might split cooking duties or take turns. But here, the husband isn't willing to adjust, leading to waste. The author is making an effort to avoid waste, which is reasonable. Since the husband isn't cooperating, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
