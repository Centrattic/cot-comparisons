My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for their husband. The author wants to eat healthier, but the husband prefers heavy meals. He even accuses her of making broccoli to watch him suffer. He doesn't try new foods and ends up throwing away food when it doesn't suit him. The author is frustrated because she doesn't want to make two meals every day and is concerned about food waste.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband's behavior, like making faces at broccoli and wasting food, seems problematic. The author is trying to manage her health and avoid eating things that upset her stomach. It's reasonable for her to want meals she enjoys. Making two different meals every day can be time-consuming and stressful. The husband's lack of effort to compromise or try lighter meals adds to the issue. Also, throwing away food is wasteful and shows disrespect for the effort put into cooking.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could explore some middle ground, like having a shared base and then individual additions. But given the husband's resistance and the waste, it's understandable she wants to focus on her needs. The key points are mutual respect and shared responsibility. Since the husband isn't contributing to the solution and is causing waste, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her health and reducing waste. So the answer should be B.\n"
