My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. She wants to eat healthier, but her husband prefers heavy, unhealthy food. He throws away the food she makes if he doesn't like it. She's making food he'll eat, even if she doesn't like it, to prevent waste. She feels like she's the asshole for making food he doesn't want and for the waste.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. She's trying to eat healthier, which is her personal choice. It's reasonable for her to want meals that align with her goals. Her husband's behavior\u2014disgust faces, throwing food away\u2014seems dismissive and possibly wasteful. Cooking is a shared responsibility in many relationships, but it's also common for people to have different preferences. If she's the one cooking, maybe there's an expectation of compromise, but that depends on the agreement between them. \n\nThe husband's refusal to try new foods and his reaction to broccoli suggest he's not open to compromise. Throwing food away is a red flag because it's wasteful and disrespectful. The author is making an effort to avoid waste by preparing food he likes, even if it's not her preference. That shows consideration. \n\nThe husband also wants to lose weight but isn't making changes, which adds to the imbalance. The author is stuck making meals that don't suit her and can't meet her health goals. She's not forcing him to eat anything; he's choosing to eat what's made or throwing it away. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's trying to balance her health goals with his preferences, and he's not cooperating, leading to waste. The problem lies more with the husband's behavior and lack of compromise. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
