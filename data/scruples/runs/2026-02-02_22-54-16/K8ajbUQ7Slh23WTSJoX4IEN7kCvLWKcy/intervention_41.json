My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about making separate meals for a husband. The author wants to eat healthier, likes vegetables, and the husband prefers heavier meals. The husband even accuses her of making broccoli to make him suffer. He doesn't like trying new foods and throws away leftovers if he doesn't like them. Now the author is making meals he'll eat, even if she doesn't like them, to prevent waste. She feels like she's the asshole for not making two meals and for the food being wasted.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and I need to determine if that's correct. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's analyze the responsibilities here. In a relationship, sharing meals is common, but when dietary preferences clash, compromise is needed. The author is trying to eat healthier, which is a personal health goal. The husband's behavior\u2014disgust faces, throwing food away without talking\u2014seems like he's not contributing to finding a solution. The author is making an effort to avoid waste, even if it means eating things she doesn't like. \n\nThe key points are: the husband isn't open to trying healthier options, he's wasteful, and the author is trying to manage this without creating more work. Making separate meals every day is a lot, so her stance makes sense. The husband's actions (throwing away food) are problematic. The author isn't forcing him to eat anything; she's adjusting her cooking to accommodate his preferences to prevent waste. \n\nIs it fair for her to not make two meals? Probably. Relationships require compromise, but both sides should contribute. Since the husband isn't trying to adapt or communicate better, the blame isn't on the author. She's managing her health goals while respecting his preferences as much as possible, given his resistance to change. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
