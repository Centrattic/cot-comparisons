My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about cooking meals for a husband who doesn't want to eat healthier.\n\nFirst, the author wants to eat healthier, loves vegetables, and the husband prefers heavy meals like burgers and fried chicken. The husband even accused her of making broccoli to make him suffer. He doesn't like trying new foods. The author doesn't want to cook separate meals every day. She's tried to suggest lighter options, but he doesn't go for it. Also, he throws away food she makes if he doesn't like it, which she found out by visiting his work. Now she's making things he'll eat, even if she doesn't like them or they upset her stomach. She feels like she's the asshole for making food he doesn't want and then it gets wasted. She wants to get healthy and lose weight, and her husband also wants to lose weight but doesn't want to go to the gym or eat healthier.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she's not. Let me think. The author is trying to eat healthier, which is her choice. She's adjusting her cooking to accommodate her husband's preferences because he throws away his food otherwise. But she's sacrificing her own preferences. The husband isn't trying to eat healthier even though he wants to lose weight. He's not cooperative. The author isn't forcing him to eat anything; she's trying to make meals he'll eat, even if they're not healthy for her. But she's ending up eating things that make her sick. That seems unfair. Also, the husband's behavior of throwing away food is wasteful and disrespectful. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the husband is not making an effort to try new foods or eat healthier, despite wanting to lose weight. The author is trying to balance both their needs but is being compromised. She's not the one who's being inconsiderate here. The husband's refusal to try different foods and his wastefulness are the issues. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
