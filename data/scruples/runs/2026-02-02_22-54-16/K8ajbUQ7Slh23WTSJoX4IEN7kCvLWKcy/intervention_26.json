My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The author is frustrated because she wants to eat healthier, but her husband prefers heavy meals and isn't open to trying lighter options. She doesn't want to cook two separate meals every day, and when she does make something he doesn't like, he throws it away without telling her. She feels like she's compromising by making food she doesn't want to eat to avoid waste, but she's trying to get healthier.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if her actions are reasonable. She's trying to maintain her health goals, which is a common and valid reason. Her husband's behavior of wasting food without communication is problematic. The fact that he's not making an effort to try new foods or accommodate her preferences could be a key point. Also, she's communicated her needs (\"asked him about lighter options\") but he hasn't responded well. The husband's accusation that she's making broccoli to watch him suffer suggests a lack of consideration on his part as well.\n\nOn the flip side, maybe she could have found a middle ground, like meal prepping separately or compromising more. But given that he's not open to trying new foods and is wasting what she makes, it's understandable she's frustrated. The key here is whether her actions are unreasonable. Since she's trying to meet her own health needs and he's not cooperating, it's likely she's not the one in the wrong. The husband's behavior is more problematic here. So the answer should be B.\n"
