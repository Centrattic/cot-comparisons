My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not wanting to cook separate meals for the husband. The author wants to eat healthier, but the husband likes heavy, unhealthy food. They mention that the husband doesn't like certain foods like broccoli, and he throws away food he doesn't want. The author is frustrated because they don't want to make two meals every day and are making things the husband likes even if it's bad for the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider each side. The author's perspective: they want to eat healthier, avoid making two meals, and prevent food waste. They've tried to communicate but the husband isn't responsive. The husband's perspective: he likes his food, but he's eating like a child, not trying new things, and wasting food.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the husband's behavior here is problematic. He's not being considerate by throwing food away without telling her, which causes waste. The author is trying to balance their own health goals with their husband's preferences. They've made an effort to ask him to choose lighter options, but he doesn't. The author isn't refusing to cook entirely; they're just making meals he likes even if it's not ideal for them. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, it's a shared issue. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the husband is the one not cooperating and causing waste, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're trying to manage their own health and reduce waste, which is reasonable. So the answer should be B.\n"
