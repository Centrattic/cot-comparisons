My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for their husband. They want to eat healthier, like vegetables, while their husband prefers heavy meals. He even accused her of making broccoli to watch him suffer. He doesn't try new foods and throws away leftovers if he doesn't like them. The author feels she's making meals she doesn't want to eat, which upsets her stomach, and she's worried about waste.\n\nSo, first, the main issue is about differing dietary preferences and the resulting conflict. The husband isn't cooperative\u2014he doesn't try to adapt, throws away food, and is unappreciative. The author is trying to accommodate his preferences but it's causing her stress and health issues. \n\nIn terms of fairness, both partners should ideally make some compromises. However, the husband isn't doing his part. He's not willing to try healthier options or consider his wife's needs. The author is making an effort to avoid waste and accommodate his tastes, but it's leading to her own discomfort. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and effort. The husband's behavior (throwing away food, making unkind remarks) is problematic. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries to take care of her own health. It's reasonable to expect that both partners contribute to shared responsibilities like cooking, especially when those responsibilities affect both people's well-being. Since the husband isn't cooperating, the author isn't at fault for not continuing to cook meals that work against her health goals and cause her stress. Therefore, the answer should be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
