My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author wants to eat healthier, prefers vegetables, and her husband likes heavy, less healthy meals. He makes a mess when she cooks broccoli and even accused her of making it to see him suffer. That's pretty harsh. She doesn't want to make two meals every day and sometimes wants a vegetarian dish. She asked him to pick lighter meals, but he's not responsive. Also, he throws away the food she packs if he doesn't like it, which she found out by visiting his work. Because of this, she's been making food he'll eat even if it's not good for her, like pasta that upsets her stomach. She feels like she's the asshole for making food he doesn't want and then it getting wasted. Both want to lose weight, but he's not making changes like hitting the gym or eating healthier.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about shared responsibilities in cooking and eating habits. She's trying to eat healthier, which is a personal goal. He's resistant to trying new foods and ends up wasting food she makes. She's adjusting her cooking to avoid waste, but it's not helping her health. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if they're sharing meals, it's reasonable to expect some compromise. However, he's not contributing to the change; he's not making an effort to eat healthier or try new things. He's also being dismissive and wasteful, which is on him. The author is trying her best but feels constrained by his behavior. She's not the one causing the problem here. His actions are leading to the conflict. So, she's not in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals, especially since he's the one rejecting the food and wasting it. The answer should be B, No.\n"
