My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. She wants to eat healthier, he prefers heavy meals. He's not adventurous with food, even making faces at broccoli. She doesn't want to make two meals every day. She tried suggesting lighter options, but he doesn't know what to pick. Also, he throws away food she makes if he doesn't like it, which she found out by visiting his work.\n\nSo the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let me break it down. First, she's trying to eat healthier, which is a valid personal goal. Making separate meals every day could be time-consuming and stressful. He's not cooperating, not trying new foods, and wasting the food she makes. The husband's behavior seems problematic here\u2014wasting food without telling her is disrespectful. She's adjusting her cooking to his preferences to avoid waste, but that's not working well because he likes things that upset her stomach. \n\nThe key points are mutual respect in a relationship. Both partners should consider each other's needs. She's making an effort to accommodate him by not making two meals, but he's not reciprocating by trying healthier options or not wasting food. The husband's behavior of discarding food she made without communication is a big issue. She's justified in wanting to eat what's best for her health without the burden of constant separate cooking. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband's actions are contributing to the problem. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
