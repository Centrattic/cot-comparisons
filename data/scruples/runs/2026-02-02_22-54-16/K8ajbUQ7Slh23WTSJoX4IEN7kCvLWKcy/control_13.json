My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals. The main points are about differing dietary preferences and the husband's behavior.\n\nFirst, the author wants to eat healthier and likes vegetables. The husband prefers heavy meals and isn't adventurous. He even makes a mean comment about the broccoli. That's not cool. Then, the author mentions he throws away food she makes if he doesn't like it, which she found out by visiting his work. That's a problem because it's wasteful and disrespectful.\n\nThe author feels she's the asshole for making food he doesn't want and leading to waste. But she's also trying to adjust her cooking to his preferences to avoid waste, even though some foods upset her stomach. She wants to get healthy, which is a valid goal.\n\nSo, is she wrong? She's not obligated to make separate meals. The husband's behavior\u2014mocking the food, throwing it away\u2014is the real issue. The author is trying to balance both needs but the husband isn't cooperating. The key here is that the husband isn't considering her health goals and is being wasteful. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
