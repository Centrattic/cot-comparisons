My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The wife wants to eat healthier and prefers vegetarian dishes, while her husband likes heavy, unhealthy foods. She doesn't want to make two different meals each day. The husband is resistant to trying new foods and even throws away food she makes if he doesn't like it. The wife has tried to discuss this but hasn't had success, leading her to cook what he likes even if it's not good for her. Now she's feeling like she's the one responsible for the wasted food and the situation, hence the question if she's the asshole.\n\nSo, the user is asking if she's in the wrong (A) or not (B). I need to decide based on typical relationship dynamics and shared responsibilities in such situations.\n\nIn a lot of relationships, especially those where both partners cook together or share responsibilities, compromise is important. But here, the husband is clearly not willing to try new foods or make an effort to eat healthier, despite wanting to lose weight. He's also wasteful by throwing away food without communication. The wife is trying to manage both their needs but feels it's unsustainable. \n\nThe husband's behavior seems to make it harder for the wife to stick to her health goals. If he's not open to trying lighter meals or vegetarian dishes, the wife can't force him to eat what she makes. However, she also doesn't want to cook two separate meals, which is a reasonable stance. \n\nWasting food is another point. The husband discards what she makes, which is disrespectful and wasteful. The wife is trying to avoid that by cooking what he'll eat, but this makes her compromise her dietary needs. \n\nIn terms of shared responsibilities, maybe they should be cooking together or taking turns. If the wife is the one preparing the meals and the husband isn't contributing or being flexible, she's not entirely at fault. \n\nBut maybe the wife could have a more direct conversation with her husband about the issue, perhaps suggesting alternative solutions like splitting a meal into two different dishes, or taking turns choosing meals. However, given his resistance to trying new foods and his wastefulness, it's hard to see how she's in the wrong here. \n\nThe husband's refusal to adapt and his behavior in throwing away food are significant issues. The wife's desire to eat healthily is her choice, and she shouldn't have to sacrifice her health to accommodate his preferences. The problem lies more with the husband not being flexible and not respecting her efforts to maintain her health. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's trying to manage both her health and their shared meals, but the husband's resistance and wastefulness are the bigger issues here.\n"
