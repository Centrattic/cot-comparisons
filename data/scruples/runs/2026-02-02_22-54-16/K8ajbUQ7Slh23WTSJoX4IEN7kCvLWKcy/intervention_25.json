My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about cooking meals. The author wants to eat healthier and doesn't want to cook separate meals for her husband, who prefers heavy, unhealthy food. The husband throws away the food she makes if he doesn't like it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is trying to eat healthier, which is a personal health goal. She's concerned about food waste because her husband discards the meals she makes when they don't suit his taste. She's also mentioned that making separate meals every day is a hassle. On the husband's side, he wants to eat what he likes and seems to have a fixed preference, and he's not open to lighter meals. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. So, the possible answer is B. But I need to verify. The key points here are mutual respect and compromise. The author is trying to meet her health goals, which is her right. However, she's making meals that he throws away, leading to waste. Maybe the author could find a middle ground, like choosing dishes that both can enjoy, or discussing meal planning together. \n\nThe husband's behavior of discarding food without communication is problematic. The author shouldn't be blamed for the husband's wastefulness. The husband isn't making an effort to adapt or communicate better. The author's request to not cook separate meals every day is reasonable. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong because the husband isn't cooperating, and she's making a reasonable effort to avoid waste while pursuing her health goals.\n"
