My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about the author not wanting to cook separate meals for their husband. The husband has different dietary preferences\u2014he likes heavy, less healthy food, while the author wants to eat healthier, more vegetarian meals. The husband even accused her of making broccoli to watch him suffer.\n\nThe author mentions that the husband doesn't try new foods and sometimes throws away leftovers if he doesn't like them. The author is now making meals he'll eat even if she doesn't like them, leading to possible food waste. She's feeling conflicted because she wants to eat healthier and lose weight, but the husband isn't really making an effort to adjust his diet either.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me think about this. Cooking for a family isn't a one-size-fits-all scenario. The husband's preferences are different, but he's also not making an effort to adapt. The author's goal is to eat healthier, which is a valid personal choice. Making separate meals can be time-consuming and might not be feasible for everyone. The husband's behavior of throwing away food without communication is problematic. The author isn't forcing him to eat anything; she's trying to accommodate his preferences to avoid waste. It seems like the husband is resistant to change, which is on him. The author isn't obligated to cook meals that make her uncomfortable just to satisfy his tastes. So, the answer should be B\u2014the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
