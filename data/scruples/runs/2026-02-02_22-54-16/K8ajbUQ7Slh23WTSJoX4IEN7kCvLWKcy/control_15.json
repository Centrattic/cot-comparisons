My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author wants to eat healthier, likes vegetables, and her husband prefers heavy, less healthy foods. He even made a comment about her making broccoli to make him suffer, which is pretty harsh. She doesn't want to make two meals every day and wants to have vegetarian dishes sometimes. She's tried suggesting lighter meals, but he doesn't go for them. Also, he throws away food she makes if he doesn't like it, which she found out by visiting his work. Now she's making food he likes even if she doesn't, but that's causing her stomach issues because of pasta, which he likes but she can't eat much of.\n\nSo the main points are: she's trying to eat healthily, he's resistant to trying new foods, he wastes food she makes, and she's ending up eating meals that don't agree with her to avoid waste. The question is whether she's the asshole here.\n\nFrom what's described, the husband isn't really making an effort to accommodate her preferences. He's dismissing her efforts (the broccoli comment) and wasting food. The author is making compromises but it's not working out. She's the one adapting to his preferences even when it's harmful to her. Since he's not trying to meet her halfway and is contributing to food waste, it seems like the husband is the one being unreasonable. The author is just trying to take care of her health and wants to avoid waste. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
