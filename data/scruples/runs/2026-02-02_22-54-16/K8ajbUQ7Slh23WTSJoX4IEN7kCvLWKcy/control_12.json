My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for their husband. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author wants to eat healthier and loves vegetables. Their husband prefers heavy meals like burgers and fried chicken. He even made a comment about the broccoli being a punishment, which is pretty harsh. The husband doesn't try new foods and throws away leftovers if he doesn't like them. The author is frustrated because they end up making food they don't want to eat or that makes them sick, just so the husband doesn't waste food. They also mention that the husband wants to lose weight but isn't making the effort to eat healthier.\n\nSo the key points here are: the husband is not open to trying healthier options, he wastes food by throwing it away, and he's not contributing to the effort of eating healthier. The author is trying to balance their own health goals with the husband's preferences, but it's causing conflict. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From what I read, the author is reasonable in wanting to eat healthier and not wanting to cook two meals every day. The husband's behavior\u2014making negative comments, not trying new foods, and wasting food\u2014seems to be the main issue here. The author isn't forcing the husband to eat anything; they're just trying to accommodate each other as much as possible. However, the husband isn't reciprocating by making an effort to try different foods or join the author in eating healthier. \n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to compromise. If the husband is resistant to change and the author is making an effort but the husband isn't, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The husband's actions (wasting food, not trying new dishes) are problematic and could be seen as the root of the problem. The author is just trying to protect their own health goals without creating waste, which is understandable. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The husband's behavior is more at fault here. The author is trying to balance their needs and isn't forcing the husband to eat anything, but the husband isn't making the effort to adapt or support the author's goals. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole in this situation.\n"
