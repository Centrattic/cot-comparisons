My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. The author wants to eat healthier and prefers vegetables, while her husband likes heavy, less healthy foods. He's even made a comment about her making broccoli to make him suffer. She doesn't want to make two meals daily and is frustrated because he throws away food she makes if he doesn't like it. They both want to lose weight, but he's not making changes like going to the gym.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. So, I need to determine if she's in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is trying to eat healthier, which is a personal choice. It's reasonable to not want to cook two separate meals every day. It can be time-consuming and stressful. The husband's behavior is problematic\u2014he throws away her cooking if he doesn't like it, which is wasteful. Also, his comment about her making broccoli to make him suffer suggests a lack of consideration for her preferences. The author is adjusting her cooking to accommodate his preferences, but she's doing it because she doesn't want waste. That seems fair.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a compromise they could make. But the husband isn't open to trying new foods or lighter meals, which makes it harder. The author isn't forcing him to eat what she makes; she's just making food he'll eat. The fact that he wastes food shows a lack of responsibility on his part. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to manage both their needs without causing waste or conflict. So, the answer should be B.\n"
