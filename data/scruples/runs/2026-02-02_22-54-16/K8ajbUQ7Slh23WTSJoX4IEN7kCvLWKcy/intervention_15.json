My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband.\n\nFirst, the main points from the situation: The author wants to eat healthier, loves vegetables, but her husband prefers heavier meals like burgers and fried foods. He's made comments about her cooking broccoli to make him suffer. She doesn't want to make two different meals every day and sometimes wants to have vegetarian dishes without starchy vegetables. She's tried suggesting lighter meals, but he doesn't know what to choose. Also, he throws away food he doesn't like at work without telling her, which led her to make food he'll eat even if she doesn't like it. She's feeling guilty about making food he doesn't want and then it getting wasted, even though he wants to lose weight but isn't making efforts like going to the gym or eating healthier.\n\nSo, the user's opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they're asking for my take. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nI need to analyze if the author is wrong. Let's break down the responsibilities. Cooking for a partner is a shared responsibility. However, it's not a one-way street. If she's making the effort to cook meals he likes but dislikes, but he's not reciprocating by trying new foods or eating healthier, maybe that's an issue. Also, his behavior of throwing away food is wasteful and disrespectful. The author is trying to manage her own health goals, which is valid. It's reasonable for her to want to eat what she wants, especially if it's healthier. But there's also a balance in a relationship where both partners make compromises. \n\nIf the husband is unwilling to try new foods or even discuss lighter options, maybe the problem is on his end. The fact that he accuses her of making broccoli to make him suffer shows a lack of consideration. Also, wasting food is his issue, not hers. She's adjusting her cooking to avoid waste, which makes sense. The husband's lack of effort to meet her halfway (like eating healthier or trying new foods) could mean he's the one not making an effort. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals. She's trying to balance her health goals and avoid waste, which is reasonable. The husband's behavior is problematic here. So the answer should be B.\n"
