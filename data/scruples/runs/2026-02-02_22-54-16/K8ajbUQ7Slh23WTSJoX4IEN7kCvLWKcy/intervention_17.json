My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author wants to eat healthier and loves vegetables, while her husband prefers heavy, less healthy foods. He's made a comment about her making broccoli to watch him suffer, and he doesn't like trying new foods. She doesn't want to make two different meals every day and wants to have the option for vegetarian dishes without starchy vegetables. She's tried to discuss this with him, but he's not open to lighter options. Plus, he ends up throwing away food he doesn't like at work, which she found out by accident. Now, she's making food he'll eat even if it upsets her stomach, like pasta. She feels she's the asshole because either she's making food he doesn't want, or that food gets wasted. She's also mentioned that he wants to lose weight but isn't making changes like going to the gym or eating healthier.\n\nSo, the user's question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks she's not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Cooking is often a shared responsibility, but sometimes one person takes it on more. The husband's behavior of throwing away food he doesn't like seems disrespectful and wasteful. The author is trying to meet her health goals, which is a personal choice. The husband, on the other hand, isn't open to trying new things and isn't contributing to the solution by making his own meals or choosing different options. The fact that he accuses her of making broccoli to watch him suffer shows a lack of consideration for her cooking efforts. The author is trying to avoid waste and sticking to her dietary needs, which is reasonable. The husband's refusal to adapt and his actions leading to waste suggest that the problem lies with him. The author isn't forcing him to eat anything; she's making what he prefers, but that's causing her discomfort. She's also making compromises, but the husband isn't reciprocating. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if she's the one doing all the cooking and he's not willing to try healthier options or make his own meals, it's his issue. The fact that he wastes food without telling her adds insult to injury. The author's main goal is to get healthier, which is a valid personal goal. The husband's resistance to change and the resulting waste mean that she's not at fault here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
