My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for their husband. The author wants to eat healthier, loves veggies, and the husband prefers heavy meals like burgers and steak. He even made a comment about the broccoli being his punishment. The husband doesn't seem to want to try new foods and ends up throwing away food if he doesn't like it. The author is frustrated because they don't want to make two meals and are ending up making food they themselves don't want to eat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband's behavior seems dismissive and not respectful of the author's preferences. He's not willing to try new things and is wasting food, which adds stress. The author is trying to maintain their health goals and avoid the hassle of doubling up on meals. It's important to note that both partners should compromise in a relationship. The husband isn't making an effort to adapt, which places the burden on the author. Additionally, throwing away food without discussing it is disrespectful and wasteful. The author is trying to manage their own health while dealing with a partner who isn't cooperative. In this case, the author isn't in the wrong because they're asserting their needs and trying to find a solution that works for both, but the husband's lack of effort is the main issue. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
