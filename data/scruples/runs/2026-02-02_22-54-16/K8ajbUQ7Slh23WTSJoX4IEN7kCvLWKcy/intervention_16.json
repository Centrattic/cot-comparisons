My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting to cook separate meals for their husband because of differing dietary preferences.\n\nFirst, the author wants to eat healthier and loves vegetables, but the husband prefers heavy, greasy foods. The husband even made a comment about the broccoli being a punishment and makes faces when eating it. The author mentions that the husband doesn't want to try new things and eats like a child. They don't want to make two meals every day and sometimes want a vegetarian option. When the author makes something the husband doesn't like, he throws it away at work without telling her. Now the author is adjusting the meals to avoid waste, but it's causing stress and compromising her health goals.\n\nSo, the author feels like they're the asshole because they're making food the husband doesn't want, leading to waste. They also mention that the husband isn't trying to eat healthier even though he wants to lose weight. The key points here are the issue of separate meals, the husband's behavior of throwing away food, and the author's health goals.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The husband's preference for heavy meals is valid, but throwing away food without communication is problematic. The author is trying to eat healthier and avoid waste, which is reasonable. Making separate meals every day can be a lot of work, and the husband's refusal to communicate about his preferences or try new things adds stress. The author's compromise is leading to meals that aren't ideal for her, which affects her health goals.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the husband is at fault for not communicating and for wasting food. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to meet their own health needs and reducing waste. The husband's lack of effort to try healthier options despite wanting to lose weight also plays a role. So, the author isn't the asshole here. The answer should be B.\n"
