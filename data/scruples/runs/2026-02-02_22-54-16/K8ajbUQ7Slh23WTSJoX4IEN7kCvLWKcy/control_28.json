My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for their husband.\n\nFirst, the author wants to eat healthier and prefers vegetables, while the husband likes heavy, less healthy foods. The husband even makes faces when eating broccoli, which the author makes. The author doesn't want to make two different meals every day and wants to occasionally have vegetarian dishes without starchy vegetables. \n\nThe husband, when offered a meal he doesn't like, throws it away at work without telling the author. The author now makes meals he'll eat, even if the author doesn't want to eat them or they make the author sick. The author feels bad about this and is concerned about food waste. They also mention the husband wants to lose weight but doesn't take action like going to the gym or eating healthier.\n\nNow, considering the situation, the author is trying to balance their own health goals with the husband's preferences. The husband isn't helping by being resistant to trying new foods and wasting food. The author is making compromises to avoid waste and accommodate him, but it's causing stress. \n\nThe key points are that the author is not in the wrong because they're prioritizing their health and trying to prevent waste. The husband's behavior (wasting food, not trying new foods) contributes to the problem. The author's request for a shared meal is reasonable, especially given the husband's lack of effort to adapt. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
