My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for their husband. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author wants to eat healthier and prefers vegetarian dishes, while the husband likes heavy, starchy foods. The husband doesn't like when she makes broccoli and even accused her of making it to watch him suffer. He also doesn't try new foods and throws away food he doesn't like at work. The author is frustrated because she's making meals he likes even if she doesn't want to eat them, leading to her not getting to eat what she wants and possibly feeling like she's the one causing waste.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about mutual accommodation in a relationship. Both partners have different dietary needs and preferences. The author is trying to eat healthier, which is a valid personal health goal. However, the husband's behavior\u2014like throwing away food and not being open to trying new things\u2014is problematic. The fact that he throws away food without telling her adds to the stress, as it wastes resources and effort.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for wanting to have meals that suit her preferences. It's reasonable to expect that both partners can have some flexibility. The husband's refusal to try lighter meals and his dismissive attitude towards her choices (like making broccoli) shows a lack of consideration. The author is adjusting her meals to avoid waste, but that's leading to her not eating what she wants. It's a two-way street; if the husband is resistant to changing his diet and ends up wasting food, the problem isn't just on the author.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the husband wants to lose weight but doesn't make changes like going to the gym or eating healthier. This might imply that he's not taking his health goals seriously, which could be part of the issue. The author is trying to support her own health goals without forcing her husband to eat something he dislikes, which is understandable. She's not making him eat broccoli if he doesn't want it; she's making separate meals he'll eat, even though they don't suit her.\n\nIn relationships, compromises are necessary. It seems the husband isn't making his share of the effort. The author is trying to balance both their needs but is frustrated because the husband isn't cooperating fully. Making two meals might be an option, but she's avoiding that because she doesn't want the hassle. However, the husband's behavior (throwing away food) is contributing to the problem.\n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals, especially when the husband isn't open to trying healthier options and ends up wasting food. The husband's lack of flexibility and consideration is the bigger issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
