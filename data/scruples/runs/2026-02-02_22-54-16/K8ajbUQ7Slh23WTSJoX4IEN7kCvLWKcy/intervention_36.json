My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals. The situation is that the author wants to eat healthier, but her husband prefers heavy meals. He even makes a joke about her making broccoli to watch him suffer. The husband isn't adventurous with food and ends up throwing away food he doesn't like. The author feels like she's the asshole because she's making meals he doesn't want, leading to waste, and she's not comfortable eating certain things herself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is trying to eat healthier, which is a personal goal. The husband's preferences are different, but he's not making an effort to try new things or compromise. He's also discarding food without communication, which seems inconsiderate. The author is trying to avoid waste by making meals he'll eat, even if it's not ideal for her. \n\nIs it fair to say the author is in the wrong? Well, she's not forcing him to eat anything. She's making an effort to accommodate his preferences to prevent waste, but he's not reciprocating. His behavior of throwing away food is problematic. The author's issue is about not wanting to cook two different meals every day, which is a common challenge in relationships. The key here is mutual compromise. If the husband isn't trying to adjust his eating habits or communicate better, the responsibility isn't fully on the author. \n\nThe author is also dealing with her own health goals, which are valid. The husband's lack of effort to adapt or communicate effectively makes it more of his issue. The fact that he wastes food when he doesn't like what's prepared shows a lack of consideration. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her health and avoiding waste by making meals he'll eat. The problem lies more with the husband's lack of flexibility and communication. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She's making reasonable efforts given the circumstances, and the husband's behavior is contributing to the problem.\n"
