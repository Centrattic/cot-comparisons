My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for their husband. The key points here are about the dynamics of their dietary preferences and the resulting conflict.\n\nFirst, the author wants to eat healthier, focusing on vegetables and lighter meals. The husband, on the other hand, prefers heavy, less healthy foods like burgers and fried chicken. There's a mention of the husband being uncooperative\u2014he doesn't want to try new foods and sometimes throws away leftovers without discussing it. The author feels burdened by having to make meals that aren't ideal for them, leading to possible food waste and personal discomfort, like the pasta example.\n\nNow, considering typical relationship norms around shared responsibilities. In many couples, it's common to compromise when it comes to meal planning. However, the husband isn't willing to participate in this compromise. He refuses to try new foods and isn't open to lighter options, which the author has already discussed with him. The husband's behavior of throwing away food without communication adds to the problem, as it's disrespectful and creates waste.\n\nThe author's stance is about their own health goals and the desire to not have their efforts result in waste. They're not forcing the husband to eat something; they're making what he wants, which he then discards. The author isn't the one discarding food or being inconsiderate here. Instead, they're adjusting their meals to accommodate his preferences, which leads to their own discomfort and health goals being compromised.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They\u2019re trying to balance their needs with their partner's, but the husband isn't reciprocating the effort. The author isn't forcing anything; they\u2019re just seeking a situation where both can have their needs met without waste. The husband's lack of willingness to compromise and his actions (throwing away food) suggest that the issue lies more with him. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
