My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for their husband. The author wants to eat healthier, loves vegetables, but their husband prefers heavy meals like burgers and fried chicken. The husband even accused the author of making broccoli to watch him suffer. He doesn't like trying new foods and sometimes throws away food he doesn't like at work. The author feels they're making meals they don't want to eat just so he doesn't waste food, but it's affecting the author's health goals.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is trying to eat healthier, which is a personal goal. Cooking two meals can be time-consuming and maybe stressful. The husband's behavior, like making faces and wasting food, seems problematic. He says he wants to lose weight but isn't making changes. The author is trying to accommodate him to avoid waste, but this is harming their own health.\n\nIs the author at fault for not wanting to cook separate meals? Well, in a relationship, it's common for couples to compromise on meals. If the husband isn't willing to try healthier options or eat leftovers, the author isn't wrong to set boundaries. The husband's actions\u2014throwing food away without talking about it\u2014show a lack of consideration. The author is prioritizing their health and avoiding waste, which is reasonable.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to manage their own health goals while dealing with a partner who isn't cooperative. The husband's behavior is more to blame here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
