My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The author, a woman, doesn't want to cook separate meals for her husband because he prefers heavy, unhealthy food. She wants to eat healthier, like vegetables, but he doesn't like them and even makes faces. She mentions he throws away uneaten food without telling her, leading to waste. She's now making food he likes even if she doesn't, which upsets her stomach. She feels she's the asshole for making him food he doesn't want and causing waste, but she wants to stay healthy.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The author is trying to maintain her health goals, which are valid. Cooking for two people with different dietary needs can be tough. The husband's behavior\u2014accusing her of making broccoli to make him suffer and throwing food away\u2014sounds dismissive and disrespectful. He's not making an effort to adapt or communicate. The author is trying her best to accommodate his preferences to avoid waste, even if it's not ideal for her. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's not forcing him to eat anything. She's making food he likes, but when he doesn't like what she makes, he wastes it. She's also making an effort to avoid making him food he'll throw away. His actions seem more problematic because he's not contributing to the solution and is causing waste. The author is trying to balance her health goals with his preferences, which is reasonable. The husband isn't meeting her halfway, like suggesting lighter meals as she asked. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband's behavior is more at fault here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
