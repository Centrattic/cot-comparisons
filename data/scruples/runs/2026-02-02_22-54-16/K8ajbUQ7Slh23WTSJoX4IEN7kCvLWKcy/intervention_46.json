My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband.\n\nFirst, the author wants to eat healthier, likes vegetables, and is trying to lose weight. Her husband prefers heavy, less healthy meals like burgers and fried chicken. He's even made an unkind comment about her cooking broccoli. She doesn't want to make two meals every day and wants to sometimes have vegetarian dishes. She's tried suggesting lighter meals, but he doesn't go for it. Also, he throws away food she makes if he doesn't like it, which she found out by visiting his work.\n\nNow, considering the arguments for both sides. The author's perspective is that she's doing her best to adjust her meals so he doesn't waste food, even though some dishes upset her stomach, like pasta. She feels she's being blamed for making food he doesn't want. On the other hand, the husband isn't showing willingness to try healthier options or even light meals, and he's being wasteful by discarding food without discussing it. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I agree. The key points here are the husband's unwillingness to adapt his diet, the food waste, and the author's efforts to accommodate his preferences to avoid waste. The author isn't being unreasonable by not wanting to cook two separate meals daily. It's a shared responsibility, but the husband isn't contributing his part. The author's health goals are valid, and she's not the one causing the problem here. The answer should be B.\n"
