My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about cooking separate meals for their husband. The author wants to eat healthier, prefers vegetables, but the husband likes heavy meals. He's not adventurous with food and even makes faces when eating broccoli. The author doesn't want to make two meals every day and wants to have vegetarian options sometimes. The husband ends up throwing away food he doesn't like at work, which the author found out by accident.\n\nSo, the author feels like they're the asshole for making food the husband doesn't want, leading to waste. But the husband isn't trying to adjust either. He's not choosing lighter meals, and the author is compromising by making things he'll eat even if it's not good for them, like pasta which upsets her stomach.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness in their situation. Both want to eat healthier, but the husband isn't making an effort to try new foods or eat what's prepared. The author is trying to make meals that are good for them but the husband is resistant and wastes food. The author is frustrated because their efforts lead to waste and they can't eat what they want. \n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting to cook two meals? It's common for couples to have different dietary needs, but when one partner is resistant and causes waste, it's a problem. However, the author is trying to find a middle ground. The husband's behavior of throwing away food without communication is problematic. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to eat healthier and avoid waste. The husband's lack of flexibility and the waste caused by his actions suggest that the author isn't the one at fault here. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
