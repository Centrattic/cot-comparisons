My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. The author wants to eat healthier and prefers vegetables, but her husband likes heavy, less healthy foods. He's even accused her of making broccoli to make him suffer. She mentions he doesn't try new foods and throws away leftovers if he doesn't like them. She's compromising by making things he likes, even if it upsets her stomach, to avoid waste. She feels bad about making food he doesn't want and the waste, but she wants to get healthy.\n\nFirst, the key points here are mutual respect and communication. The husband's behavior\u2014throwing food away without telling her\u2014is wasteful and disrespectful. He's not open to trying healthier options, even though he also wants to lose weight. The author is trying to balance her health goals with their shared meals. \n\nCooking separate meals can be a lot of work, and it's reasonable for her to want to eat what she likes sometimes. The husband's refusal to even consider lighter meals and his dismissive attitude (making faces, accusing her of wanting to watch him suffer) show a lack of effort on his part. \n\nThe author is making an effort to accommodate his preferences to avoid waste, even at her own discomfort (like eating pasta that upsets her stomach). That's a sign of consideration, but it's also unsustainable if it's causing her health issues. She's not the one being inconsiderate here; the husband isn't engaging in the compromise. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. She's trying to maintain her health goals and reduce waste, while the husband isn't contributing to the solution and is being uncooperative.\n"
