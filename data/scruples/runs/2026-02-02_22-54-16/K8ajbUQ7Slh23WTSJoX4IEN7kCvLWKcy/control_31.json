My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. The situation is that she wants to eat healthier, he likes heavy meals, and there's some conflict about food preferences and waste.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is making an effort to eat healthier, which is a valid personal goal. Her husband has different dietary preferences and even wastes food when he doesn't like it. The author feels conflicted because she doesn't want to make two separate meals every day, especially when he ends up throwing away the food she makes. She's also concerned about her own discomfort with certain foods like pasta.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The husband's behavior of wasting food without communication is problematic. If he's throwing away the food, that's a waste of resources and effort. The author is trying to adjust by making meals he'll eat, even if they don't suit her dietary needs. But she's also trying to maintain her health goals.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's not making him eat something he doesn't want. She's trying to balance both their needs. However, maybe she could suggest alternative solutions, like cooking separate meals occasionally or ordering different meals if they eat at different times. But the main issue is the husband's resistance to trying new foods and the waste. The author's desire to eat healthier isn't inherently wrong. She's also being considerate by not making meals that make her sick but he likes. \n\nThe husband's actions (wasting food, not being open to lighter meals) are more of a problem here. The author isn't forcing him to eat anything; she's accommodating his preferences to avoid waste but is now feeling conflicted because it's not aligning with her health goals. So she's not entirely in the wrong. The answer is likely B (No), but let me double-check. \n\nAnother angle: if she's making meals that she doesn't want to eat, maybe she's compromising too much. But she's also considering his preferences to avoid waste. It's a balance. Since the husband is the one not being flexible and causing waste, the author's stance makes sense. So, answer B.\n"
