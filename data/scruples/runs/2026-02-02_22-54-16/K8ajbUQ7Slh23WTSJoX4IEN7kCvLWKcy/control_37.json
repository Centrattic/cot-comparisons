My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about making separate meals for their husband.\n\nThe author wants to eat healthier and likes vegetables, but the husband prefers heavy meals like burgers and fried chicken. The husband accused her of making broccoli to watch him suffer, which he dislikes. He's not adventurous with food and even throws away meals he doesn't like at work. The author is making meals he'll eat, even if she doesn't like them, to prevent waste. She feels it's unfair because she's not getting her preferred meals and the food gets wasted. She's also struggling because her husband wants to lose weight but isn't making the effort to eat healthier.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are:\n\n1. The author is making meals that the husband will eat, even if she doesn't want to eat them. She's compromising to avoid waste.\n2. The husband is not contributing to healthier options and is resistant to trying new foods. He also wastes food by throwing it away without talking to her.\n3. The author is trying to eat healthier and lose weight, which is her personal goal. The husband also wants to lose weight but isn't making changes.\n\nThe husband's behavior seems problematic. He's not open to trying new foods, is wasteful, and doesn't support his wife's goals. The author is trying to balance her health goals with her husband's preferences, but he's not reciprocating. She's making an effort to cook meals he likes, even if it's not ideal for her, but the husband isn't making any effort towards eating healthier or being more flexible.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the husband's actions (wasting food, not trying new things) contribute to the problem. The author is trying to manage the situation to avoid conflict and waste, which is reasonable. She's not forcing him to eat what she makes; she's just not making separate meals anymore. The husband's resistance and lack of effort might be the main issues here.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's trying to meet her health goals and accommodate her husband as much as she can, but he's not cooperating. The answer should be B (No).\n"
