My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation where they don't want to cook separate meals for their husband. The author wants to eat healthier, but their husband prefers heavy, less healthy meals. The husband has reacted negatively to the author's attempts to make healthier food, even accusing her of making broccoli to watch him suffer. He also wastes food if he doesn't like it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is trying to eat better, which is a valid personal goal. They don't want to cook two different meals every day, which is understandable. The husband's behavior, like making faces and wasting food, seems problematic. He's not open to trying new foods and isn't helping the situation by not communicating or making lighter meal choices when possible.\n\nThe key points are the author's right to eat healthily without catering to her husband's preferences, the husband's resistance to new foods, and the issue of wasted food. The author isn't forcing the husband to eat anything; she's making food they can both eat. The husband's actions of throwing away food without discussing it are disrespectful and wasteful. The author's concern about not wanting to waste food is valid, so she's adjusting her cooking based on his preferences to avoid waste. The husband's lack of initiative in choosing lighter options despite wanting to lose weight is also a factor here.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the husband is not taking ownership of his food choices. The author is trying to balance both their needs but is being met with resistance. Since the husband isn't making an effort to adapt or communicate better, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals. Her actions are reasonable, and the husband's behavior is contributing to the problem. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
