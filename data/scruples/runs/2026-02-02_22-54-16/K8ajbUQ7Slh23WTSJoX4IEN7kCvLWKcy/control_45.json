My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for their husband. The husband's diet is heavy\u2014burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food\u2014and he doesn't seem to like vegetables. The author wants to eat healthier, and the husband is not adventurous with food. He even throws away the meals the author makes if he doesn't like them, like the broccoli. The author is conflicted because making two meals seems like a lot of work, and the husband's waste makes them feel like they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is trying to eat healthier, which is a personal choice and goal. The husband, on the other hand, has different preferences and isn't really open to change. The key issue is the expectation of the author to accommodate his preferences, possibly at the expense of their own health goals and effort. \n\nThe husband's behavior of throwing away food without telling the author is problematic. Wasting food is a red flag, and the author is concerned about not wanting the food to go to waste. The author is making a compromise by preparing meals that the husband will eat, but the husband's resistance to trying new things and his lack of effort to eat healthier is a point against him. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. In relationships, mutual compromise is usually expected. If the husband is unwilling to adapt or consider the author's efforts, and if the author is making an effort to meet his preferences (like making pasta even though it upsets her stomach), that shows the author is trying. The husband's refusal to engage and his wastefulness might indicate he's not contributing fairly. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their own health goals, and the husband's actions (not trying new foods, wasting meals) are contributing to the problem. The answer should be B.\n"
