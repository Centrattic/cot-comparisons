My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. The author wants to eat healthier and loves vegetables, but her husband prefers heavy meals. He made a comment about her making broccoli to watch him suffer, and he doesn't try new foods. She doesn't want to make two meals every day and is concerned about waste because he throws away the food she makes if he doesn't like it. She's also mentioned that he wants to lose weight but doesn't make efforts to eat healthier or exercise.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about shared responsibilities in a relationship, particularly regarding meal preparation. In many relationships, cooking is a shared effort, but there's no one-size-fits-all approach. The author is expressing her preferences and health goals, which are important for her well-being. \n\nHer husband's reaction (making faces, throwing food away) suggests he's resistant to her efforts. The fact that he wastes food without telling her is problematic. It's not just about her not wanting to cook two meals; it's about his behavior contributing to waste and not respecting her efforts. \n\nThe author is trying to balance her health goals with their shared household, but her husband isn't cooperating. If they were cooking together or taking turns, maybe the situation would be different, but based on the description, the husband isn't contributing to the lighter meals. He's also not trying to adapt to her preferences, which could hinder their shared goal of weight loss. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to eat healthier and not making separate meals when it leads to waste and conflict. The husband's unwillingness to compromise and his disrespectful behavior are the main issues here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
