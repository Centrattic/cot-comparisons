My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. The key points here are the dietary preferences and the conflict around meal preparation.\n\nFirst, the author wants to eat healthier, focusing on vegetables, while her husband prefers heavy, less healthy foods. She mentions that he doesn't like certain vegetables and even makes faces, which is a bit rude. Also, he throws away the food she makes if he doesn't like it, leading to waste. She's trying to avoid making two meals each day, which is a common issue in households with differing dietary needs. \n\nThe husband's behavior of discarding food without telling her is problematic. Wasting food is a valid concern, and the author is trying to adjust her cooking to accommodate his preferences to prevent waste, even if it means eating things she's not fond of. The husband's lack of effort to try new or healthier options and his own admission of wanting to lose weight without making changes himself adds to the imbalance.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a fairness perspective, both partners should contribute to finding a solution. Making separate meals can be time-consuming, but it's a common compromise in relationships. However, the husband's refusal to adapt and his wasteful behavior are significant issues. The author isn't forcing him to eat what he doesn't like; she's just choosing to cook what he'll eat to prevent waste. \n\nConsidering the circumstances, the author isn't being unreasonable. The husband's actions (wasting food, not trying new things) are more problematic. The author is trying to balance her health goals and the couple's shared meals without unnecessary waste. Therefore, she's not in the wrong here.\n"
