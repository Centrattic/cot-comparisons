My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. The author wants to eat healthier, but her husband prefers heavy, unhealthy food. He even accuses her of making broccoli to watch him suffer. She doesn't want to make two meals every day and is frustrated that he throws away food she makes if he doesn't like it. She mentions that he's not adventurous with food and that making things he likes sometimes upsets her stomach.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's preferences are different, but he's also contributing to the problem by wasting food. The author is trying to take care of her health, which is a valid reason. Making separate meals can be time-consuming and maybe not practical. The husband's behavior of wasting food without communication is problematic. The author isn't the one wasting food; she's adjusting her cooking to avoid waste. Also, the husband's comment about broccoli being a joke about suffering suggests he's not taking her dietary needs seriously. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is important. However, the husband isn't making an effort to try healthier options or communicate better. The author is trying to find a middle ground but is met with resistance. The key points here are the author's health goals, the husband's resistance and food waste, and the lack of effective communication. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because she's making a reasonable effort to balance both their needs while avoiding waste. The husband's actions and attitudes are more at fault here. So the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
