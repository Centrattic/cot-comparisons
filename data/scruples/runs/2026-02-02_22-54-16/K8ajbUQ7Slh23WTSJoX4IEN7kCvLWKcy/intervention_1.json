My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. The author wants to eat healthier, loves vegetables, but her husband prefers heavy, less healthy meals. He's even been dismissive, making faces at broccoli and not trying new foods. She's tried suggesting lighter options, but he doesn't know what to pick. Also, he throws away food he doesn't like without telling her, leading to waste. Now she's mostly cooking what he likes, even if it's not good for her, to avoid waste.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's health goals are valid. She's trying to improve her diet, which is a personal choice. Her husband's eating habits are different, but that doesn't mean she has to accommodate them at her own expense. Cooking separate meals can be time-consuming and may not be fair to expect her to do if it's causing her stress or health issues. \n\nHer husband's behavior\u2014throwing away food without communication\u2014is problematic. That shows a lack of consideration and maybe even disrespect for her efforts. The fact that he accuses her of making broccoli to make him suffer adds to a negative dynamic. It seems like he's not being cooperative or respectful of her preferences.\n\nShe's compromising by making food he likes even when it's not good for her, but that's a temporary solution. The root issue is that both need to find a middle ground. Maybe they can agree on a few dishes that both can eat, or take turns choosing meals. The husband's lack of willingness to try new foods or communicate his preferences (like picking a lighter meal) is part of the problem. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her health. It's reasonable to expect mutual compromise in a relationship. The husband's actions (wasting food, not cooperating) are more on him. So the answer should be B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
