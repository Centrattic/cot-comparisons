My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about cooking separate meals for her husband versus her wanting to eat healthier. She's frustrated because he doesn't like vegetables and ends up not eating them, making faces, and even throwing away food she made. He also wants to lose weight but doesn't seem to make changes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author wants to eat healthier, which is a personal goal. She's trying to make meals that are better for her, but her husband's preferences clash with that. She mentions he doesn't like certain foods and even wastes them. Making two separate meals every day might be time-consuming and not practical. It's understandable she doesn't want to do that.\n\nOn the other hand, her husband's reaction\u2014making faces and throwing away food\u2014seems disrespectful and wasteful. He's not being considerate of her efforts to cook for him, even if he doesn't like the meal. The fact that he doesn't try new foods or make an effort to eat healthier is a problem. The author is trying to meet her health goals without forcing him to eat things he dislikes, but he's not reciprocating by trying to adapt a bit.\n\nThe question is whether she's at fault for not wanting to cook separate meals. From what's described, she's communicated her needs and he hasn't made an effort to accommodate. If he's not willing to try lighter meals or respect her efforts, then it's not her fault that he's not eating what she makes. She's also avoiding making food she can't eat herself, which makes sense for her health.\n\nSo, the key points are: communication attempts by the author, lack of effort from the husband to adapt, and the husband's wasteful behavior. The author is trying to balance her health goals with their relationship, but the husband isn't contributing to the solution. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for not wanting to cook two meals daily when he's not cooperating.\n"
