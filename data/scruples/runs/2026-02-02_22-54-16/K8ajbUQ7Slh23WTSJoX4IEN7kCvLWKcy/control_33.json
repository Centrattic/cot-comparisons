My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The question is about whether the author is wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for their husband.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author wants to eat healthier, likes vegetables, and finds their husband's preferences (like burgers, fries, etc.) heavy. The husband doesn't like trying new foods, makes faces at broccoli, and there's been an issue where he throws away food he doesn't care for. The author is frustrated because they don't want to make two different meals each day and feel like they're the bad guy for either making food he won't eat or having it wasted. The husband also wants to lose weight but doesn't take steps like going to the gym or eating healthier.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: Is the author wrong for not cooking separate meals? Well, cooking is a shared responsibility in many relationships, but expectations can vary. The author has communicated their desire for healthier options but the husband isn't open to trying new foods. The husband's behavior of throwing away food is problematic because it's wasteful and disrespectful. The author is trying to accommodate his preferences but it's causing them stress and health issues (like stomach problems from pasta).\n\nThe husband's actions\u2014accusing the author of making broccoli to watch him suffer and wasting food\u2014suggest he's not considerate of her efforts. The author is caught between their health goals and the hassle of cooking two different meals. They're also concerned about food waste, which shows they're trying to respect his preferences but it's backfiring. \n\nIn many relationships, compromise is expected. However, if one partner's preferences are leading to waste, health issues for the other, and a lack of willingness to adapt from the other side, it's reasonable for the author to set boundaries. The husband's refusal to try lighter meals and his wastefulness could be seen as more inconsiderate. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to prioritize their health and reduce the burden of cooking differently every day. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're making a reasonable choice given the circumstances, especially since the husband isn't contributing equally or respecting the author's needs.\n"
