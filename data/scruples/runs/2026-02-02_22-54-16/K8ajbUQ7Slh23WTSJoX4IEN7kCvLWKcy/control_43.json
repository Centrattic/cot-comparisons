My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to make separate meals for their husband. The situation is that the husband doesn't like healthier foods and ends up throwing some away, which the author finds wasteful. The author wants to eat healthier, but the husband's preferences are causing problems.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is concerned about their health and wants to avoid waste. The husband isn't open to trying new foods and might be contributing to the waste. The author mentions that making separate meals every day is burdensome. \n\nIs it fair for the author to not have to accommodate someone else's preferences if it's causing them stress and waste? The husband's behavior of throwing away food without talking about it seems problematic. The author has tried to compromise but the husband isn't cooperating. \n\nAlso, the husband's comment about the broccoli being a punishment suggests a lack of consideration. The author is trying to get healthier, which is a valid goal. If they have to make meals that make them sick, that's not fair either. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong because they're making reasonable requests for their health and well-being, and the husband isn't being cooperative or respectful. The waste is due to his actions, not the author's decision to prioritize their own needs. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
