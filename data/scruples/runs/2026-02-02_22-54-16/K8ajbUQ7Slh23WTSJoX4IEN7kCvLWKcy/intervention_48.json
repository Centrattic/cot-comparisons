My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Alright, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The author of the post is struggling with cooking separate meals for their husband. The key points here are the author's desire to eat healthier, the husband's preference for heavy meals, and the resulting tension over food choices and waste.\n\nFirst, the author wants to eat healthier and enjoys vegetables, but the husband doesn't like those and prefers meat-heavy dishes. The husband even accused the author of making broccoli to watch him suffer, which shows a lack of consideration on his part. The author is tired of making two meals every day and wants some flexibility in their diet. \n\nThen there's the issue of the husband throwing away food he doesn't like without telling her, leading to waste. The author is now making meals the husband likes, even if they're not good for her, to prevent waste. This seems like a compromise, but it's causing her stress because she wants to eat healthily. The husband's behavior of wasting food is a problem here. \n\nThe author feels guilty for not making two meals but is also frustrated by the waste and the lack of reciprocation from the husband. The husband wants to lose weight but doesn't take action, like going to the gym or eating healthier. This imbalance in effort could be a factor.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband's behavior\u2014being uncooperative, making negative comments, and wasting food\u2014contributes to the problem. The author is trying to find a solution that works for both, but the husband isn't pulling his weight. The author's desire to eat healthily and avoid waste is reasonable. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
