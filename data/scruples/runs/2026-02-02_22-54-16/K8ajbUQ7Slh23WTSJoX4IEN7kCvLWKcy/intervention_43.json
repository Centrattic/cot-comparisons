My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the wife wants to eat healthier, but her husband prefers heavier meals. She doesn't want to cook separate meals every day. He's resistant to trying new foods, and she ends up making things he likes even if she doesn't like them, leading to her not getting to eat what she wants. Also, he's wasting food by throwing it away without telling her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife's main points are her desire to eat healthier and lose weight. She's making compromises by not making separate meals but ends up not eating what she wants. The husband's issue seems to be about his taste preferences and not being open to new foods. He's also not communicating well, throwing away food, which is wasteful.\n\nThe key here is mutual respect and communication. The wife is trying to meet his needs but at the expense of her own. She's compromising too much. The husband isn't open to trying lighter meals, even though he wants to lose weight. His behavior of throwing away food is disrespectful and shows a lack of consideration for her efforts and resources.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should work towards solutions that accommodate both needs. Making separate meals might be a viable option if the husband is willing to try. But since he's resistant and there's a history of food waste, the wife's stance seems reasonable. She's not in the wrong for prioritizing her health and not wanting to waste food. The husband's actions are more problematic here. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
