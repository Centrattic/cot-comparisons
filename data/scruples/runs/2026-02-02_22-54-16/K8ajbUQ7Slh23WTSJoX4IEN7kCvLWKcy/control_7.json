My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about meal preferences between a husband and wife. The author wants to eat healthier, like more vegetables, while the husband prefers heavier, less healthy foods. They don't want to make separate meals every day, but the husband throws away food he doesn't like, which the author finds wasteful. The author now makes things the husband will eat even if they don't suit the author's diet. The author feels they're the asshole for making unhealthy meals and causing waste.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key issues here are shared responsibilities in meal preparation, dietary preferences, and waste. The author is trying to eat healthier, which is a personal choice. The husband's behavior of discarding uneaten food without discussing it is problematic. The author is adjusting their cooking to avoid waste, which makes sense. The husband isn't contributing to finding a solution, like eating the food or suggesting alternatives. The author isn't forcing the husband to eat anything; they're trying to accommodate by making meals they both can eat. The husband's actions (throwing food away) are disrespectful and wasteful. The author's desire to eat healthier isn't unreasonable. They're not making the husband eat something; they're making meals that they both can consume, which is a reasonable compromise. The husband's lack of cooperation and the waste are the main issues here. So the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to balance their health goals with the husband's preferences without creating waste. The husband's behavior is more at fault here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
