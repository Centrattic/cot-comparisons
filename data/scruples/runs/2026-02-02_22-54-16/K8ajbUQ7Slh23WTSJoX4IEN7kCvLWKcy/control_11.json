My husband, however, loves heavy meals.

And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for their husband. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author wants to eat healthier, loves vegetables, and their husband prefers heavy meals like burgers and fried chicken. The husband even made a comment about the author making broccoli to watch him suffer. The author is tired of making two different meals every day and wants to occasionally have vegetarian dishes without starchy veggies. They tried suggesting lighter meals to the husband, but he doesn't know what to pick. Also, he throws away food he doesn't like without telling her, which she found out by visiting his work. Now she's mostly making what he likes even if she doesn't like it, leading to her eating pasta that upsets her stomach. She feels she's the asshole because she's making food he doesn't want and it's getting wasted. She wants to get healthier and lose weight, while the husband also wants to lose weight but isn't making changes like going to the gym or eating healthier.\n\nSo the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's look at the arguments. She's trying to eat healthier and doesn't want to cook two separate meals. The husband is resistant to trying new foods and is even wasteful with the food. She's making compromises, but he's not reciprocating. He's throwing away food she makes, which is a waste. She's adjusting her meals to avoid making him waste food, but that's causing her discomfort (like the pasta). \n\nOn the other hand, maybe she should be more flexible? But he's the one not trying new things. Also, the husband's comment about suffering is harsh. The key points are mutual respect and effort. The husband isn't making an effort to eat healthier or try new things, and he's being wasteful. The author is trying to take care of her health and preferences. It's a shared responsibility in a relationship to compromise. Since the husband isn't cooperating and is causing waste, the author isn't in the wrong. She's justified in not wanting to cook separate meals when he's not making an effort. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
