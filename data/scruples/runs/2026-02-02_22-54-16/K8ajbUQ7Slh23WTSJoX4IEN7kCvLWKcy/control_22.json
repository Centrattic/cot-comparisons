My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. The situation is that she wants to eat healthier, but her husband prefers heavier, less healthy meals. He doesn't like vegetables and even makes faces when eating them. She doesn't want to make two different meals every day and wants to have vegetarian dishes sometimes. She's tried to get him to choose lighter meals, but he doesn't know what to choose. Also, he throws away food she makes if he doesn't like it. The author feels like she's being an asshole for making food he doesn't want and leading to waste. She's mostly making his preferred meals now, but some of them she can't eat or make her sick.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points here are about shared responsibilities in a household, communication, and mutual respect. Cooking is often a shared responsibility unless otherwise agreed. However, if both partners have different dietary needs, it's reasonable to expect that they might need to accommodate each other to some extent.\n\nThe husband's behavior, like throwing away food without telling her, seems disrespectful and wasteful. He's not considering her efforts. Also, making faces at the food she prepares could be seen as dismissive of her preferences. The author is trying to eat healthier and wants to avoid foods that make her sick. It's reasonable for her to want to prepare meals that suit her needs, especially since they have different dietary preferences.\n\nShe mentioned that she's making meals he likes, but that's causing her to eat things she doesn't want. That's a problem because it's affecting her health and preferences. The husband's unwillingness to try new foods or communicate his preferences is part of the issue here. The fact that he wastes food she prepares also adds to the conflict.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is important. However, if one person is consistently making sacrifices without the other contributing equally, it can lead to imbalance. The author isn't entirely in the wrong because she's trying to meet her health goals and avoid waste. However, the husband's lack of effort to adapt or communicate is also a factor. The author's desire to not cook separate meals is understandable, especially if it's becoming burdensome.\n\nLooking at both sides, the husband's actions (throwing away food, not trying new options) are problematic. The author isn't the one causing the issue; she's trying to manage the situation by making meals he'll eat but that's not ideal for her. The core issue is the husband's behavior and lack of cooperation. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; the husband is. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
