My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about cooking separate meals. The author wants to eat healthier, likes vegetables, but her husband prefers heavy meals. He's not adventurous with food and even made a comment about her making broccoli to watch him suffer. She doesn't want to make two meals every day and wants to have vegetarian dishes sometimes. She's tried talking to him, but he doesn't pick lighter options. Also, he throws away the food she makes that he doesn't like without telling her. Now she's making things he'll eat, even if she doesn't like them or they upset her stomach. She feels like she's the asshole for making food he doesn't want and causing waste. She wants to get healthy and lose weight, and he also wants to lose weight but only if he doesn't have to exercise or eat healthier.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author is trying to eat healthier, the husband's preferences conflict with that, he's not open to trying new things, he wastes food, and the author is compromising by making meals she doesn't like to avoid waste. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author has a reasonable expectation to eat healthier without having to cook separate meals. In many relationships, sharing meals is common, but when dietary needs differ significantly, compromises are necessary. The husband's behavior\u2014throwing away food without communication\u2014is problematic. It shows a lack of consideration for her efforts and contributes to waste. The author's desire to eat healthier is valid, and she's making an effort to accommodate his preferences to prevent waste, which is a mature approach. However, the husband's resistance to trying new foods and his comment about suffering suggest he's not contributing to the solution. The author isn't the one causing the waste; he is. So, she's in a difficult position where her efforts are being undermined. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. She's trying to balance her health goals with his preferences, but his actions are exacerbating the issue. The correct answer is B.\n"
