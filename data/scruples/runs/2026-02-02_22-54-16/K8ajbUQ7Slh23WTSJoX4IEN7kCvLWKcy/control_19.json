My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. The author wants to eat healthier, prefers vegetables, and her husband likes heavy, unhealthy food. He's even made a comment about her making broccoli to watch him suffer. She doesn't want to make two meals every day and wants some vegetarian dishes without starchy veggies. She's tried talking to him about lighter options, but he's uncooperative and ends up throwing away the food she makes if he doesn't like it. She's now making foods he likes even if she doesn't, which upsets her stomach, and feels like she's the asshole for it.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from both sides. The author has valid reasons for wanting to eat healthier and avoid making meals that make her sick. Her husband's behavior of throwing away food is problematic and wasteful. The fact that he accuses her of making broccoli to \"watch him suffer\" suggests he's being difficult and not respectful of her preferences. She's compromising by making food he likes even if it's bad for her, but he's not reciprocating. \n\nCooking is a shared responsibility in many households, but when preferences clash, communication is key. The husband isn't open to trying new things or lighter meals, which makes it hard for her. The waste of food is also a red flag because it shows disrespect for her efforts. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her health and avoiding unnecessary conflict. She's tried to communicate, but the husband isn't cooperating. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's making a reasonable request for her health, and the husband's behavior is the issue here. Making separate meals can be burdensome, and she's justified in seeking a solution that works for both, but since he's not cooperating, her stance is valid.\n"
