My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. The situation involves differing dietary preferences and the husband's behavior towards food.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The wife wants to eat healthier, likes vegetables, and doesn't want to cook two separate meals every day. The husband, on the other hand, prefers heavy meals like burgers, steak, and fried foods. He even accused her of making broccoli to watch him suffer, which he makes faces at. He's not adventurous with food, and when she makes something he doesn't like, he throws it away without telling her. Now she's making meals he'll eat, even if they upset her stomach, to prevent waste. She feels she's the asshole for making food he doesn't want and causing waste, but she wants to get healthy.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they want to know my take. The answer should be A or B. Let's consider the ethics here. Cooking for others can be a shared responsibility. The husband's behavior of throwing away food without communication is problematic. The wife's desire to eat healthier and avoid cooking two separate meals isn't unreasonable. It's common in relationships to have differing preferences, and expecting the other person to adjust their habits without compromise can lead to issues. The husband isn't showing willingness to adapt, while the wife is making an effort to avoid waste. The husband's actions (throwing away food) indicate a lack of consideration. The wife isn't in the wrong if she's not making him eat something he doesn't like and is instead prioritizing her own health and avoiding waste. The key here is mutual respect and compromise. Since the husband isn't trying to meet her halfway (like eating lighter meals or trying new foods), the wife's stance is more justified. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
