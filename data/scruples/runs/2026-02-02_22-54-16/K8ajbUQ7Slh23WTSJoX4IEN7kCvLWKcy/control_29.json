My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for their husband. The situation is that the author wants to eat healthier, but the husband prefers heavy meals. The husband even made a comment about the author making broccoli to watch him suffer. The author mentions that the husband doesn't try new foods and sometimes throws away the food he doesn't like. The author feels like they're the asshole because they end up making meals they don't want to eat, or even ones that make them sick, to avoid waste.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a right to eat what they want for health reasons. The husband's behavior, like throwing away food without telling, is problematic. The author isn't obligated to prepare meals that they themselves don't want to eat. However, maybe there's an expectation in a relationship to accommodate each other's needs. But in this case, the husband is resistant to change and causes waste, which is on him. The author is trying to find a middle ground but is frustrated. The husband's actions are contributing to the problem. So the author isn't in the wrong for not cooking separate meals. The husband's lack of flexibility and waste are key issues here.\n"
