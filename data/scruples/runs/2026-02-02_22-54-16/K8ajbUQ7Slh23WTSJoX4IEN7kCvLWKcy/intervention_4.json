My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. The main points are about differing dietary preferences and the husband's behavior regarding food.\n\nFirst, the author wants to eat healthier and prefers vegetarian dishes, while her husband likes heavy meals like burgers and fried foods. She mentions that he makes faces at certain foods, like broccoli, which she tried to introduce. He also doesn't try new lighter meals and ends up throwing them away at work. She's not making separate meals anymore to avoid waste, but this leads to her eating things she doesn't like or that upset her stomach, like pasta. \n\nNow, considering the situation, the key issues are communication and compromise. The author has tried to discuss lighter meal options with her husband, but he's not open to them. His throwing away the food causes waste and frustration. The author is adjusting her cooking to avoid waste but feels she's making sacrifices. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, it's a personal choice to prioritize her health and avoid waste. The husband's behavior of discarding food without explanation is problematic. The author isn't forcing her preferences on him; she's trying to balance both their needs but he's not cooperating. In relationships, it's common to find middle ground, but when one person isn't willing to adapt, the other has the right to set boundaries. The author isn't wrong for not wanting to cook two meals, especially after his past actions. So the answer is B.\n"
