My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. The main points are that she wants to eat healthier, with more vegetables, but her husband prefers heavy meals like burgers and steak. He's even made fun of her for making broccoli. She doesn't want to make two different meals every day and feels like she's the one making compromises. She's also mentioned that he sometimes throws away food she makes if he doesn't like it, which upsets her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is trying to take care of her own health and preferences, which is a valid concern. It's reasonable for her to want to eat what she likes and avoid foods that make her sick, like pasta. However, she's the one making the meals that her husband likes, even if they don't suit her. The husband, on the other hand, isn't open to trying lighter meals and is wasteful by throwing away food he doesn't want. He also has his own health goals but isn't making an effort to eat better, which complicates things.\n\nThe key issue here is mutual compromise. In a relationship, both partners should be willing to make some adjustments. The author is making a lot of adjustments by cooking what he likes, even if it's not what she wants. But the husband isn't really trying to accommodate her preferences, like not eating the pasta that upsets her stomach or not being open to new foods. His behavior of throwing away food is also problematic because it's wasteful and not considerate of her efforts.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because she's justified in wanting to eat healthier and not wanting to cook separate meals all the time, especially when he's not making any effort to compromise. The husband's actions are more at fault here\u2014being uncooperative, wasteful, and dismissive of her needs. The author is trying to find a balance, but it's the husband who's not contributing equally to the solution. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
