My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about cooking separate meals for her husband versus her own healthier preferences.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author wants to eat healthier, loves vegetables, and finds it hard to cook for her husband who prefers heavy, less healthy meals. He's made comments about her making broccoli to watch him suffer, and he's not adventurous with food. She mentions that when she makes something he doesn't like, he throws it away without telling her. She feels like she's making meals she doesn't want to eat to avoid waste. She's also concerned about him wanting to lose weight but not making the necessary changes like eating healthier or going to the gym.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she's not, but wants to confirm. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, it's reasonable for her to want to eat healthily and not have to cook separate meals every day. However, making him eat something he dislikes might be an issue. But he's throwing away the food, which is wasteful. She's trying to balance her needs and his, but he's not contributing to the solution, like trying new foods or helping with meal prep. \n\nThe husband's behavior is problematic. He's not cooperative, wastes food, and makes unkind comments. The author is trying to find a middle ground but feels forced to compromise her health goals to prevent waste. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. If one partner is making all the sacrifices, it becomes a problem. Here, the author is trying to meet his needs but he's not making any effort. It's not fair to expect her to cook only for him when she has her own health goals. The fact that he wastes food adds to the issue. \n\nSo, the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong. The husband's actions and lack of cooperation are the main issues here. The author is justified in wanting to eat healthily and reduce waste, even if it means the husband has to adapt or manage his preferences differently.\n"
