My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for their husband. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author wants to eat healthier and prefers vegetables, while the husband likes heavy meals like burgers and fried chicken. There's a mention of the husband making faces at broccoli and even throwing away food he doesn't like without telling her. The author feels like they're the asshole because they make meals he doesn't want, leading to waste, and they don't want to eat what he likes because it upsets their stomach.\n\nSo, the key points here are mutual preferences, the husband's reaction to certain foods, and the issue of food waste. The author is trying to maintain their health goals, which is understandable. The husband's behavior\u2014throwing away food without communication\u2014seems disrespectful and wasteful. \n\nThe author has tried to communicate their need for lighter meals but the husband isn't cooperative. The husband also wants to lose weight but doesn't seem to take steps like going to the gym or eating healthier. This might indicate a lack of effort on his part as well.\n\nThe author is clearly making compromises by cooking what he likes to prevent waste, but it's causing them distress because they can't eat what he prefers. It's a balance issue. The husband's actions (wasting food, not trying new foods) contribute to the problem. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries to maintain their own health and reduce waste. They've tried to communicate but there's no reciprocity from the husband. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
