My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about making separate meals for their husband because of different dietary preferences.\n\nFirst, the author wants to eat healthier, loves vegetables, and dislikes the heavy meals her husband prefers. The husband makes fun of her for making broccoli, and he throws away food he doesn't like. The author is frustrated with making two meals and not being able to eat what she wants without worrying about waste.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are mutual respect, communication, and compromise. The author has tried to discuss this with her husband, but he's not receptive. He's not making an effort to try lighter meals or eat what's prepared. His behavior of discarding food without telling her is disrespectful and wasteful.\n\nThe author is trying to take care of her health, which is a valid goal. It's reasonable to want meals that suit her dietary needs. The husband's resistance and the resulting waste are issues on his part. The author isn't forcing him to eat anything; she's just choosing to make meals she can eat, even if he doesn't like them. \n\nSo, the problem seems to stem from the husband's unwillingness to adapt or communicate effectively. The author isn't in the wrong here because she's asserting her needs and trying to maintain her health. The husband's actions are contributing to the conflict, not the author's.\n"
