My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals. The author wants to eat healthier, loves veggies, but the husband prefers heavy, unhealthy food. The husband even accuses her of making broccoli to watch him suffer. He doesn't try new things, throws away food he doesn't like, and they both want to lose weight but he's not making changes.\n\nSo, the author feels she's the asshole because she's making food he doesn't like, which gets wasted. But she's also trying to eat healthier. The question is whether she's wrong for not making separate meals. \n\nHmm. Cooking for a partner can be a shared responsibility. If both want to eat differently, maybe they need a compromise. The husband's behavior of throwing away food is wasteful and not respectful. The author is trying to align her meals with her health goals, which is reasonable. But if she's making meals that he ends up not eating and wasting, that's a problem. She might be in a tough spot because she's accommodating his preferences to avoid waste, but it's causing her to eat foods she doesn't like. \n\nBut the key issue here is whether she's wrong. The husband's actions (wasting food, not trying new things) are problematic. The author's desire to eat healthier isn't unreasonable. So, maybe she's not in the wrong. She's trying to find a balance, but the husband isn't cooperating. The answer should be B (No), since the husband's behavior is worse, and the author has valid reasons for her stance.\n"
