My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. She wants to eat healthier and loves vegetables, but her husband prefers heavy meals. He's even accused her of making broccoli to make him suffer. She mentions he doesn't want to try new foods and throws away leftovers at work. Now, she's making foods he likes even if she doesn't, and he's eating pasta which upsets her stomach. She feels like she's the asshole for not making separate meals and for the food being wasted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Cooking is a shared responsibility in many relationships, but sometimes one person's preferences can affect the other. The husband's behavior sounds pretty dismissive and inconsiderate. Accusing her of making broccoli to watch him suffer is harsh. Also, throwing away food without telling her is wasteful and disrespectful. \n\nShe's trying to eat healthier, which is her right. If he can't accommodate her needs without complaint, maybe the issue lies more with his behavior than her trying to have her own meals. But she's also not making separate meals, which could be a compromise. However, given his actions, maybe she's justified in not wanting to go out of her way for him. \n\nThe key points are mutual respect and compromise. If he's not open to trying lighter meals and is wasting food, she might not be in the wrong for prioritizing her health and avoiding conflict. It's also about communication. If she's already asked him to pick lighter options and he hasn't, maybe she's done her part. The husband's actions (disgust face, throwing food away) contribute to the problem. \n\nSo, based on this, the author is not in the wrong. She's trying to manage her health and avoid wasting food, which he's responsible for. The husband's behavior seems more problematic here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
