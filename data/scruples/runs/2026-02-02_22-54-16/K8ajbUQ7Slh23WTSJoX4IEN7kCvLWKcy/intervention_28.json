My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. She wants to eat healthier, loves vegetables, and her husband prefers heavy, less healthy foods. He's even been dismissive and wasteful with the food she makes. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main points are about her health goals and the frustration with having to cook meals that either make her sick or are thrown away. She mentions that her husband doesn't try new lighter meals and wastes the food she makes. The husband's behavior seems to contribute to the problem, as he's not open to trying healthier options and is wasteful.\n\nIn terms of responsibilities in a relationship, especially regarding shared tasks like cooking, it's reasonable for both partners to have some input. However, the husband's resistance to trying new foods and wasting the meals she prepares adds to the conflict. The author is trying to meet her health goals, which is a valid personal goal. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The author has tried to discuss lighter meal options with her husband, but he hasn't been cooperative. His actions (throwing away food without discussing it) are problematic. The author isn't forcing him to eat what she makes; she's adjusting her cooking to avoid waste, which might be a reasonable compromise. \n\nConsidering all this, the husband's behavior is more at fault here. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries regarding her own health and avoiding the creation of food that will be wasted. So the answer should be B.\n"
