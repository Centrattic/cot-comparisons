My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted this is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the wife wants to eat healthier and doesn't want to cook separate meals for her husband, who prefers heavy, less healthy food. The husband accuses her of making broccoli to watch him suffer, doesn't try new foods, and sometimes throws away food she makes. The wife feels she's being the asshole because she's making meals she doesn't like to avoid waste, and she's frustrated with his eating habits.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether the wife is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals. The husband's behavior is problematic: he's not open to trying healthier options, wastes food, and is dismissive of her preferences. The wife is trying to take care of her health, which is a common and valid goal. It's reasonable for her to want to eat the way she prefers without forcing herself to eat meals she dislikes. Making two different meals every day can be time-consuming and stressful, so her desire to streamline meal preparation is understandable.\n\nThe husband's actions of throwing away food she prepared without communication are inconsiderate and wasteful. This shows a lack of respect for her efforts. The wife is trying to accommodate his preferences up to a point, but it's leading to meals she can't eat (like pasta that upsets her stomach). She's balancing both their needs but feels it's unfair. Since the husband isn't willing to adapt or communicate effectively, the responsibility isn't entirely on the wife. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the wife isn't being unreasonable. She's setting boundaries for her health and well-being. The husband's unwillingness to compromise or try new things is a bigger issue here. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the husband's behavior is the main problem, and the wife is justified in seeking a solution that works for her health.\n"
