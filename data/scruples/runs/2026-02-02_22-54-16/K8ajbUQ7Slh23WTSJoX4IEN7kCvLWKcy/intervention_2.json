My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. The situation is that the wife wants to eat healthier and prefers vegetarian dishes, but her husband likes heavy, starchy foods. He doesn't like vegetables, makes faces when eating them, and even throws away food she makes if he doesn't care for it. The wife feels like she's being the asshole because she's making food he doesn't want and it's getting wasted, but she wants to get healthy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Both partners have different dietary preferences. The wife is trying to eat healthier, which is a valid goal. The husband, on the other hand, has his own preferences but isn't open to trying new things and sometimes wastes food. The wife is making compromises by making things he'll eat, even if it's not good for her, to avoid waste. But she's also frustrated because she can't eat what she wants and feels like she's the one at fault.\n\nThe key points are: the husband's behavior (being uncooperative, wasting food, not trying new things) versus the wife's desire for a healthier lifestyle. The wife is trying to avoid making two separate meals, which can be time-consuming and wasteful. The husband's actions, like throwing away food, show a lack of consideration. The wife is making an effort to accommodate him to prevent waste, but it's taking a toll on her health goals.\n\nI think the wife is not in the wrong here. She's trying to balance her health goals with her husband's preferences and is making compromises. The husband's behavior, especially wasting food, is problematic. The wife isn't forcing him to eat something he dislikes; she's making what he likes, but that's hurting her own goals. The fact that he doesn't help in finding a solution (like suggesting lighter meals) makes him the one at fault. So the answer should be B, she's not in the wrong."
