My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author doesn't want to cook separate meals for her husband because she's trying to eat healthier. The husband, on the other hand, prefers heavier, less healthy foods and even throws away the meals she makes if he doesn't like them. The author feels like she's making meals she doesn't want to eat, which upsets her, and she's concerned about waste. She also mentions that the husband wants to lose weight but doesn't seem to make an effort beyond not going to the gym.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is trying to maintain her health and prefers vegetarian or lighter meals, while her husband's choices are less healthy and he's not cooperative. The husband's behavior of discarding food without telling her adds to the problem. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's common for couples to have different dietary needs or preferences. The author is trying to compromise by making meals that both can eat, but when that's not possible, she's making meals he likes even if they don't suit her. However, this leads to her not getting to eat what she wants, which is part of her health goals. \n\nThe husband's actions of throwing away food are problematic. If he's not going to eat what's prepared, that's wasteful and disrespectful. The author isn't forcing him to eat anything; she's making meals that align with his preferences when she's not making her own. But when she does make something different, he doesn't like it and gets rid of it. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. I think she's not because she's trying to meet her health goals and is making an effort to accommodate his preferences when possible. The main issue lies with the husband's refusal to try new foods and his wasteful behavior. The author isn't the one causing the waste or being uncooperative. So, the answer should be B, No.\n"
