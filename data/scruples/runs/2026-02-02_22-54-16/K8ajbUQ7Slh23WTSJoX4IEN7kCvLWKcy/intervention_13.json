My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband, who has different dietary preferences. The author wants to eat healthier, including more vegetables, while the husband prefers heavy meals like burgers and fried chicken. He even makes fun of her when she makes broccoli. The author is frustrated because making two meals is a hassle, and sometimes he throws away food she makes that he doesn't like. She feels like she's being the asshole for making food he doesn't want, leading to waste, and she wants to eat better.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: she's trying to improve her health, which is a valid reason. Making separate meals every day could be time-consuming and stressful. She's also dealing with her husband's negative reactions, which might be disrespectful. The husband's side: he likes certain foods, and maybe he has his own preferences, but he's not making an effort to try healthier options. He even throws away food she made, which is wasteful and not considerate.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. From what's described, she's trying to meet her own health goals, which is her right. The husband's behavior seems dismissive and inconsiderate. The author isn't forcing him to eat what she makes. She's also trying to avoid waste by making things he'll eat, which shows she's trying to accommodate him. The husband's actions of throwing away food are problematic. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. She's asserting her needs and preferences without forcing her husband to eat something he doesn't like. The key points are mutual respect and effort. The author is making an effort to balance both, while the husband isn't. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
