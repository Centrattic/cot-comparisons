My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. She wants to eat healthier, and her husband prefers heavy meals. He even made a comment about her making broccoli to watch him suffer. The husband doesn't like trying new foods and ends up throwing away food she makes, which she finds out by visiting his work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is trying to maintain a healthier lifestyle, which is a valid personal goal. It's reasonable for her to want meals that align with that. However, she's making meals that he doesn't like, leading to waste. But wait, he throws them away without telling her, which is his fault. The husband's behavior is contributing to the problem by not communicating and being uncooperative. \n\nThe author mentions that when she makes something he doesn't like, he throws it away. That's a sign of his inconsiderate behavior. Also, she's adjusting her cooking to avoid making him waste food, which shows she's trying to accommodate him. The husband, on the other hand, isn't making an effort to try lighter meals or communicate his preferences better. He even accuses her of making broccoli to make him suffer, which is a childish reaction.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author isn't doing anything wrong by choosing to cook meals that suit her dietary needs. The husband's unwillingness to try new foods and his actions of wasting food are the root issues here. The author's solution of cooking what he likes but that makes her feel unwell is a compromise, but it's not sustainable for her health goals.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The problem stems more from the husband's behavior. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
