My husband, however, loves heavy meals.

And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole for not wanting to cook separate meals for their husband. They want to eat healthier, love vegetables, but their husband prefers heavy meals like burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, and fast food. The husband has accused the author of making broccoli to make him suffer, and he eats like a five-year-old, not trying new foods. The author doesn't want to make two different meals every day and would like to have vegetarian meals sometimes without starchy veggies. They asked the husband to pick lighter options, but he doesn't know, and if he doesn't like what's made, he throws it away without telling her. She's now making meals he'll eat, even if she doesn't like them or they make her sick, to avoid waste. She feels like she's the asshole for making food he doesn't want and causing waste. She wants to get healthy and lose weight, and the husband also wants to lose weight but doesn't mind avoiding the gym or eating healthy.\n\nSo the main points here are: the author is trying to eat healthier, the husband has different preferences, he's resistant to trying new food, and there's an issue with food waste. The author is trying to compromise by making meals the husband will eat, even if it's not healthy for her, leading to her not being able to eat what she wants.\n\nFirst, I should consider the responsibilities in a relationship regarding shared tasks like cooking. If they're a couple, it's common for them to share meal duties. If the husband is willing to eat what's made but refuses to try new things, maybe the responsibility isn't entirely on the author. However, the husband's behavior of throwing away food without communication is problematic. Food waste is a big issue, and the author is trying to avoid that, which is reasonable.\n\nThe husband's accusation that she's making broccoli to make him suffer suggests a lack of communication and understanding. The author is trying to eat healthier, which is a personal goal. If the husband can't adapt his eating habits or communicate his preferences better, that's on him. But the author is also making compromises by preparing meals he likes, even if they're not healthy for her. However, she's not forcing him to eat anything; he's choosing to eat what's available. If he's not eating the healthier meals she wants, maybe they need to find a middle ground or take turns preparing different types of meals.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is wrong for not cooking separate meals. In many cases, couples do cook together or take turns, or they might have separate meals if possible. If the author is the one doing all the cooking and the husband isn't contributing, that could be an issue. But the question is about whether she's in the wrong for not wanting to cook two different meals. Since she's already compromising by making meals he likes, even though they're not ideal for her, it seems like she's making an effort. The husband's part in this is not contributing, refusing to try new things, and wasting food.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the author is making an effort to accommodate his preferences already, and he's not reciprocating by trying to eat healthier or by not wasting food, then it's not entirely her fault. The husband's behavior is contributing to the problem. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. She's trying to balance her health goals with his preferences but is facing resistance and food waste, which are on his side. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
