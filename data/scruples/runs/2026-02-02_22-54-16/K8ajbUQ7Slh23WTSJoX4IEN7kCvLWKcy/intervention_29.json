My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. She wants to eat healthier, but her husband prefers heavy meals and doesn't like vegetables. He even makes faces when eating broccoli and has thrown away food she made, leading her to now make meals he likes even if she doesn't. She feels like she's the asshole because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's goal is to eat healthier and lose weight. Making separate meals every day might be time-consuming and not sustainable. Her husband's preferences are different, and he's not open to trying new or lighter foods. He also wasted food she made, which adds to her frustration.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and compromise in a relationship. The author is trying to balance her health goals with her husband's preferences. However, when she makes meals he doesn't like, he throws them away, which is disrespectful. The husband isn't willing to adjust his habits or communicate effectively. The author is avoiding making meals she doesn't want to eat to prevent waste, which seems reasonable.\n\nIs it the author's fault for not making two meals? Probably not. Relationships require compromise, but there's a limit. If one partner's preferences are causing the other to eat poorly or waste food, that's a problem. The husband's behavior in wasting food and not being open to trying new things seems more problematic. The author is trying to find a middle ground where both can have meals they can eat, but the husband isn't contributing to the solution.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The main issues are the husband's resistance to change and the waste. The author is managing her health goals while trying to accommodate her husband's preferences, which is a valid approach. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
