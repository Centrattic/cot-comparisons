My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. \n\nFirst, the key points from the situation: She wants to eat healthier and loves vegetables, while her husband prefers heavy, less healthy foods. He's even made a sarcastic comment about her making broccoli to watch him suffer. She doesn't want to make two different meals each day and wants to have vegetarian or lighter meals sometimes. She's tried to discuss this with him, but he's not open to trying new things. Additionally, he's been throwing away food she makes if he doesn't like it, which she found out by visiting his work. Now, she's mostly making things he'll eat, even if they don't suit her, to prevent waste.\n\nThe user thinks she's not in the wrong, so I need to assess if her stance is justified. From a fairness perspective, it's reasonable for her to want to eat healthy meals without compromising all the time. Cooking separate meals every day can be time-consuming and may not be practical. Her husband's behavior of discarding uneaten food is problematic because it's wasteful and disrespectful. He's not being considerate of her efforts, and his lack of willingness to try lighter meals or communicate better adds to the issue. \n\nShe's making an effort to accommodate his preferences to avoid waste, but this is causing her to eat things that make her uncomfortable. The husband's approach seems self-centered, not contributing to shared goals like weight loss through healthier eating. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband's actions and attitudes are the main issues here. The answer should be B.\n"
