My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for their husband. The author wants to eat healthier, prefers vegetables, and their husband eats heavy meals like burgers and fried chicken. The husband even makes faces at broccoli and once accused the author of making it to watch him suffer. He also throws away food he doesn't like at work without telling her, leading to waste. The author is now making meals he'll eat even if she doesn't like them, which upsets her stomach sometimes.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's desire to eat healthily and the husband's resistance to trying lighter meals. The husband's behavior\u2014like throwing away food and not being adventurous\u2014might contribute to the problem. The author is trying to find a balance to avoid waste and meet her own health goals. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because she's trying to accommodate his preferences but also maintain her health goals. The husband's actions (not eating different meals, wasting food) might be the bigger issue here. Plus, making two meals every day is a lot of work, and it's reasonable for her to want to avoid that. So the answer should be B.\n"
