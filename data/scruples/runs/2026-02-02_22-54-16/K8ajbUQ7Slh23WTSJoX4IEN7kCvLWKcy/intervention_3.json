My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. The author wants to eat healthier, and her husband prefers heavy meals. He doesn't like vegetables and even throws away food if he doesn't want it. The author says she's been making meals he'll eat, even if she doesn't like them, to avoid waste. She feels guilty about making food he doesn't want and that it gets thrown away.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about the author's desire to eat healthier, the husband's resistance to trying new foods, and the waste of food. The husband's behavior of throwing away food without telling her adds to the problem. The author is trying to compromise by making meals he'll eat, but it's affecting her own preferences and health goals.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. From the situation described, the author is trying to balance her health goals with their shared meals. She's made an effort to accommodate his preferences to prevent waste, but this is conflicting with her own needs. The husband's actions (like not communicating and throwing away food) seem to be the main issues here. The author isn't forcing him to eat anything; she's adjusting her cooking based on his preferences. The fact that he doesn't want to try healthier options despite wanting to lose weight is a problem on his part.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's making a reasonable effort to meet both their needs where possible while prioritizing her health. The husband's resistance and waste are his responsibility. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
