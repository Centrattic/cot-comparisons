My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about cooking meals for her husband versus her own health goals.\n\nFirst, she wants to eat healthier, loves vegetables, but her husband prefers heavy meals like burgers and fried food. He even accused her of making broccoli to watch him suffer, which is pretty harsh. She doesn't want to make separate meals every day and sometimes wants vegetarian dishes without starchy veggies. She's tried suggesting lighter meals, but he doesn't know what to pick. Also, he throws away food he doesn't like at work without telling her, leading to waste. Now she's making food he'll eat even if she doesn't like it, but it's causing her stomach issues.\n\nSo, the main points are: she's trying to eat healthier, he's resistant, he wastes food, and she's feeling like she's compromising too much. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals.\n\nFrom what I see, she's making efforts to accommodate him but is also trying to take care of her health. He's not being considerate of her needs, even making a mean comment about her cooking. The fact that he wastes food shows he's not respectful of her efforts. She's right to prioritize her health and avoid making meals that make her sick. The husband seems to be the one not cooperating, not considering her boundaries. So the answer should be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
