My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband because of dietary differences. The husband eats heavy, unhealthy food, and she wants to eat healthier, with more vegetables. He doesn't like broccoli and makes faces, and she mentions he wastes food when he doesn't like it. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out if she's being unreasonable. She's trying to eat healthier, which is a personal choice. She doesn't want to make two different meals every day, which is understandable. The husband, on the other hand, seems to have a habit of not trying new things and wasting food. The fact that he throws away food he doesn't like is a problem. \n\nThe user is feeling guilty because she's making meals he doesn't want, leading to waste. But wait, the husband's behavior of wasting food is on him. She's trying to accommodate him by making things he'll eat, but it's causing her to eat things she doesn't want. That's a conflict. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe she could find meals that are healthier but still include some of his preferences, or maybe he could eat leftovers. But the core issue is that she's not the one wasting food; he is. She's trying to avoid waste by making what he likes, even though she's not fond of it. \n\nThe husband also wants to lose weight but isn't making changes. That's his responsibility, not hers. So, she's not in the wrong for wanting to eat healthier and not cooking separate meals. The problem lies with his refusal to try new foods and his wastefulness. \n\nSo the answer should be B, No. The author isn't in the wrong.\n"
