My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. The key points here are about dietary preferences, shared responsibilities in meal preparation, and the husband's behavior regarding food waste.\n\nFirst, the author wants to eat healthier, focusing on vegetables, while her husband prefers heavy, less healthy meals. The husband's reaction to broccoli and his throwing away uneaten food at work are significant. The author is concerned about making meals she doesn't like just for him, leading to possible waste. She's adjusting her cooking to accommodate him, which affects her own dietary goals.\n\nThe main issue is whether it's reasonable to expect the author to prepare separate meals. In many relationships, couples often find compromises, like taking turns cooking different meals, using separate ingredients, or planning meals that both can enjoy. However, the husband's unwillingness to try new foods and his wasteful behavior complicate things. If he's not open to lighter meals and ends up wasting food when the author makes something he doesn't like, that's on him. The author is trying to manage her health and avoid waste, which seems fair. Making him eat something he dislikes repeatedly is not ideal, but the core issue is the lack of mutual compromise. Since the husband isn't contributing to finding a solution and is causing waste, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her health and avoiding waste. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
