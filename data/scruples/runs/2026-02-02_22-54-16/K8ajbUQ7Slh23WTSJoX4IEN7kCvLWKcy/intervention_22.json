My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author doesn't want to cook separate meals for her husband, who has different dietary preferences. She wants to eat healthier, with more vegetables, while he prefers heavy, less healthy foods. He's been uncooperative, not trying new things, and even wasting food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is making an effort to eat healthier and avoid making two meals every day, which can be a lot of work. She's also concerned about food waste, especially since she found out her husband was throwing away leftovers. On the other hand, the husband's preferences are different, and he might feel that his needs aren't being met. However, he's not really trying to adapt either\u2014throwing away food and making a mess with his eating habits.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The author has already tried to discuss healthier options with her husband, but he's not responsive. The husband's actions (wasting food) are problematic because they contribute to the problem. The author is trying to find a balance where she can maintain her health goals without unnecessary stress or waste. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is important, but both parties need to put in effort. The husband isn't showing much willingness to adjust, which might make the author's stance more justified. Also, the husband's behavior of discarding food without discussion is inconsiderate. So, the author isn't being unreasonable here. She's trying to manage their shared responsibilities while keeping her own health goals in mind. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
