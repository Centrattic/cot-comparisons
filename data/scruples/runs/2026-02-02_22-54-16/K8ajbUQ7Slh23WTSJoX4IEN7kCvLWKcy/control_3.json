My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about making separate meals for a husband who doesn't like healthy food. The author wants to eat healthier but their husband eats heavy meals and doesn't like vegetables. He even accused her of making broccoli to watch him suffer. The author doesn't want to make two different meals every day and is frustrated that he throws away food he doesn't like. They mention he eats like a 5-year-old and is unadventurous with food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a right to want to eat healthier and not have to cook things that either make her sick or she doesn't want to eat. On the other hand, the husband might feel that his preferences are being ignored. But the key points here are that he's been wasteful, throwing away food that the author made, and he's resistant to trying new things. The author is trying to find a balance where she doesn't have to cook separate meals all the time, and she's adjusting to his preferences to avoid waste, but it's causing her stress.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if he's not eating the food and causing it to be thrown away, that's his issue. The author is making an effort not to cook things that make her sick, but he's not cooperating or trying to adapt. The husband's behavior of discarding food without telling her adds to the problem. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to eat healthier and not wanting to waste food. She's trying to communicate her needs but he's not responding constructively. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
