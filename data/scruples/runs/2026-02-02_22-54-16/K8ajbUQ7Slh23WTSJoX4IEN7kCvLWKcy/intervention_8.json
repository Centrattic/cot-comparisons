My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about cooking separate meals for their husband. The author wants to eat healthier and loves vegetables, but their husband prefers heavy meals like burgers and fried chicken. The husband even accused them of making broccoli to make him suffer, and he doesn't like trying new foods. The author doesn't want to make two different meals every day and sometimes wants to just have vegetarian dishes. They mentioned that when they make something he doesn't like, he throws it away at work without telling them, which they found out by visiting his workplace. Now, they're mostly making food he'll eat, even if it's not their preference or makes them uncomfortable, to avoid waste. The author feels they're the asshole for making food he doesn't want and for the waste, but they want to get healthy and lose weight. The husband also wants to lose weight but only if he doesn't have to exercise or eat healthier, which seems a bit contradictory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is making an effort to eat healthier, which is a personal goal. However, the husband's eating habits are very different. The key issue is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals. In many relationships, sharing meals is a common practice, but both partners should have some flexibility. The husband throwing away food without telling them is disrespectful and wasteful, which could be a red flag. It\u2019s not just about the author\u2019s preferences but also about the husband\u2019s behavior towards the food and the effort put into preparing it.\n\nThe author is adjusting their cooking to accommodate the husband's preferences to prevent waste, which seems reasonable. The husband\u2019s accusation that the author is making broccoli to make him suffer is not only rude but also dismissive of their health goals. If the husband truly wanted to lose weight, he might need to be more cooperative in meal planning. However, he's not making an effort to eat healthier and instead avoids it by not trying new foods and wasting what he doesn't like. \n\nIn terms of fairness, making two meals every day can be a lot of work, and expecting one partner to do that without the other being flexible might not be balanced. The author is trying to manage their own health, which is valid. The husband's actions (wasting food, not communicating) add to the problem. The author isn't forcing him to eat anything; they're just making meals that both can eat, which is a practical solution. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They\u2019re trying to balance their health needs with the husband's preferences and the issue of food waste. The husband's behavior\u2014being uncooperative, wasteful, and making negative comments\u2014seems to be the main problem here. The author's compromise is understandable, and it's the husband who might need to adjust, perhaps by being more open to trying different foods or communicating his preferences better. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
