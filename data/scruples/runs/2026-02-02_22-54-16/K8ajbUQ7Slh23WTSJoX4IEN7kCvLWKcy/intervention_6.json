My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is a person who doesn't want to cook separate meals for their husband. The husband's eating habits are heavy and he doesn't like vegetables, even making faces when he eats broccoli. The author wants to eat healthier and has tried to get the husband to choose lighter meals, but he doesn't cooperate. He even throws away food he doesn't like without telling her, leading to waste. The author feels pressured to make food she doesn't want to eat just so he doesn't waste it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a right to want to eat healthily and not have to cook separate meals every day. It's reasonable to want to avoid food waste, especially if the husband is discarding food. The husband's behavior of throwing away food without communication is problematic because it shows a lack of consideration and responsibility. The author isn't forcing him to eat anything; she's making meals she can eat while trying to accommodate his preferences, but he's not making an effort to reciprocate or communicate better.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect, communication, and shared responsibility. The husband isn't trying to adapt his eating habits despite the author's suggestions. The fact that he wastes food without discussion adds to the problem. The author is trying to find a balance but is facing challenges because the husband isn't contributing equally to solving the issue. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband's actions are contributing to the problem, and the author is seeking a reasonable solution. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
