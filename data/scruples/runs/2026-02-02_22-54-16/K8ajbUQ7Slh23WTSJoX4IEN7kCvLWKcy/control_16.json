My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for their husband.\n\nThe author wants to eat healthier, loves vegetables, and tries to make vegetarian dishes. Their husband prefers heavy, less healthy foods like burgers, steak, and fried chicken. There's a history of the husband making faces at broccoli and even throwing away uneaten food at work without telling them. The author now avoids making meals that the husband might not like, even if it means eating something they don't prefer themselves, like pasta twice a week, which upsets their stomach. They feel they're the asshole for making food he doesn't want and for the food being wasted, while the husband wants to lose weight but doesn't want to eat healthier or exercise.\n\nSo, the main points are: the husband's eating habits are different and he's resistant to change, the author is trying to eat healthier, and there's a conflict over meal preparation and food waste.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author isn't forcing the husband to eat their meals. They're trying to find a balance but the husband isn't cooperative. The husband's behavior of throwing away food is wasteful and disrespectful. The author is adapting by making meals the husband will eat, which might not be ideal for their own health goals. However, the husband's refusal to compromise or try lighter options complicates things. \n\nThe key here is that the author is seeking a solution that aligns with their health goals without causing waste, which is reasonable. The husband's lack of effort to adjust his diet and his wastefulness are significant factors. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to manage their own health and avoid unnecessary work. The husband's behavior is more problematic. So, the answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
