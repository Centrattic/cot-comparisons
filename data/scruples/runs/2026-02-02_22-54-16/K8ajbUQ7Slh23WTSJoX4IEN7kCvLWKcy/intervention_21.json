My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. \n\nFirst, the author wants to eat healthier and prefers vegetarian dishes. Her husband, on the other hand, likes heavy, greasy foods and isn't open to trying new things. He even makes faces when eating broccoli, which the author finds frustrating. She's tried to get him to choose lighter meals, but he ends up throwing away the food she makes if he doesn't like it. Now, she's compromising by making meals he likes, even if they upset her stomach, to avoid waste.\n\nThe main points here are autonomy in dietary choices and shared responsibility in household tasks. The author is within her right to choose what she eats for her health. The husband's refusal to try new foods and his wastefulness are his issues. Cooking for both should be a shared effort, but it seems the author is shouldering all the work, making compromises that aren't healthy for her. \n\nThe husband's behavior\u2014throwing away food without discussion\u2014shows a lack of consideration. The author's frustration is valid because she's not only catering to his preferences but also dealing with the consequences of his choices. The key here is mutual effort. If the husband isn't willing to adapt or communicate better, the author isn't at fault for setting boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
