And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about cooking meals. The author wants to eat healthier, loves vegetables, and their husband prefers heavy meals like burgers, steak, fried chicken. The husband accused the author of making broccoli just to watch him suffer, and he makes faces. He also doesn't try new foods, throws away food he doesn't like at work. The author feels they're being the asshole by making food he doesn't want, leading to waste, and now they're avoiding making things that upset their stomach. The husband wants to lose weight but doesn't want to exercise or eat healthier.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author wants to eat healthier, which is a common goal. Making separate meals can be time-consuming and maybe costly. The husband's attitude is negative, making faces, not being open to trying new foods. He also wastes food by throwing it away without telling her. The author is adjusting meals to suit his preferences now because they don't want waste, but some of those foods affect the author's stomach. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the husband refuses to try new meals and ends up wasting food, he's contributing to the problem. The author is trying to accommodate his preferences to avoid waste, but that's causing the author to compromise their own health goals. The husband's behavior (throwing food away, not trying new foods) is problematic. The author isn't forcing him to eat anything; they're just preparing what he likes, which is leading to the author not getting what they need. \n\nThe author's main issue is the conflict between their health goals and the husband's eating habits, which are inflexible and wasteful. The husband's blame on the author for making broccoli (which he dislikes) shows a lack of consideration for the author's preferences. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to eat healthier or for avoiding making meals that cause waste. The husband's actions (wasting food, not trying new things) are more in the wrong. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
