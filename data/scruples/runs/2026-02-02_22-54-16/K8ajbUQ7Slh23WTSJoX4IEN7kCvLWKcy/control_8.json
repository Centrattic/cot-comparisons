My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband who prefers heavy, less healthy food, while she wants to eat healthier. The husband doesn't like vegetables and even throws away food she makes if he doesn't like it. The author feels she's being the asshole because she's making meals he doesn't want, leading to waste, but she's also trying to eat better.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main points are that she wants to eat healthier, dislikes making two meals every day, and is frustrated with the husband's lack of interest in trying new foods or eating lighter options. The husband's behavior includes making faces at vegetables, not knowing how to choose lighter meals, and throwing away food she prepares. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, it's reasonable for the author to want to eat what she prefers without having to cater to her husband's tastes all the time. It's a shared household, so expecting her to always accommodate his preferences without compromise might be unfair. The husband's actions, like throwing away food, contribute to the problem. Also, the author isn't forcing him to eat what she makes, but when she does, he's not appreciative or cooperative. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and compromise. If the husband wants to eat different meals, he could take responsibility for preparing his own, but there's no mention of that. The author is trying to make meals that both can eat, but when that's not possible, the husband's response is to waste food. That's a valid concern for the author. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could find a middle ground, like preparing a main meal and a side dish that's lighter, so she can have her preferred meal and he can have his. But given the husband's resistance to trying new things, that might not work. The author's frustration is understandable. The husband isn't making an effort to adapt, which shifts the burden onto her. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the husband is contributing to the waste by not eating what's prepared. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to eat healthier and not wanting to make separate meals every day. It's reasonable to expect some level of cooperation from the husband, especially since they live together. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The husband's behavior is exacerbating the situation, and the author is trying to manage both their needs without success. The main issue is the husband's lack of effort and the resulting waste, which isn't the author's fault.\n"
