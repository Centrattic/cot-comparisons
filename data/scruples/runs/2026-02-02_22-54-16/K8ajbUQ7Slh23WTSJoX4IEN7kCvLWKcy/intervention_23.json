My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about cooking meals for the husband versus wanting to eat healthier. The author doesn't want to prepare separate meals because it's a hassle and the husband's eating habits are different. The husband throws away food he doesn't like, which the author found out by visiting his work. The author is feeling guilty for making him eat what he doesn't want or for the food being wasted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author wants to eat healthier, which is a personal choice. The husband has different food preferences, and he's not open to trying lighter meals. He even throws away food without telling her, which is wasteful. The author is trying to make meals he'll eat, which sometimes upsets her stomach, but she does it to avoid waste. The husband also wants to lose weight but doesn't make changes, like going to the gym or eating healthier.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is the compromise in meal preparation. In a relationship, it's common for couples to make some accommodations for each other, but there's a limit. The husband's behavior of throwing away food is problematic because it's wasteful and disrespectful. The author is making an effort to accommodate him by making food he likes, even if it's not ideal for her. However, she's not forcing him to eat it; he's choosing to take it and then discard it, which is on him.\n\nThe author's stance is that she doesn't want to make separate meals every day. It's reasonable for her to want to eat what she prefers, especially for health reasons. The husband's refusal to try new foods and his reaction to broccoli (making faces) shows he's resistant to trying healthier options. The author is trying to align meals with his preferences to prevent waste, but he's not reciprocating by trying to eat healthier or being more adventurous.\n\nIn terms of fairness, both partners should contribute to the compromise. However, the husband is not making an effort to change his habits, while the author is making significant accommodations. The fact that he wastes food is a key point. It's his responsibility to handle his portion without wasting it. The author isn't obligated to cook two different meals unless they agreed to. The husband's behavior is the main issue here, not the author's desire to eat healthier or avoid making two meals. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B."
