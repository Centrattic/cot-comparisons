My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"Am I the Asshole\" situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about cooking meals for the husband versus wanting to eat healthier. The author doesn't want to make separate meals every day and is frustrated because her husband doesn't like some of the healthier options, like broccoli, and ends up throwing food away. She feels like she's compromising by making meals she doesn't want to eat just so he doesn't waste food, even though it's bad for her stomach. Her husband wants to lose weight too but isn't making changes like going to the gym or eating healthier.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is trying to eat healthier, which is a personal choice and often recommended for health reasons. It's reasonable for her to want to prepare meals that align with her goals. However, she's making compromises by catering to her husband's preferences, which is leading to her eating foods that don't agree with her. The husband's behavior of throwing away food he doesn't like is wasteful and disrespectful, especially since the author is the one preparing the meals. Also, he's not making an effort to eat healthier despite wanting to lose weight, which could be seen as not taking responsibility for his own health goals.\n\nIn terms of fairness, both partners should consider each other's needs. The husband isn't contributing to the effort; he's not trying new foods or making changes. The author is adjusting her meals to accommodate him, but at the expense of her own health and comfort. The husband's actions (throwing away food) show a lack of consideration. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her health and not wanting to cook two meals daily. It's reasonable for her to seek a solution where both can eat something that works for them. Maybe finding a middle ground, like having separate meals occasionally or choosing dishes that both can enjoy. Since the husband isn't making an effort and is causing waste, the author isn't the asshole here. So the answer should be B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
