My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about cooking meals. The author wants to eat healthier, likes vegetables, but their husband prefers heavy, less healthy food. The husband even makes a joke about the author making broccoli to watch him suffer. He throws away food he doesn't like without telling her, which she found out by visiting his work.\n\nThe author feels she's the asshole because she's making food he doesn't want, leading to waste. She also mentions that she's not eating the pasta he likes because it upsets her stomach. They both want to lose weight, but the husband isn't making efforts to eat healthier. The author is frustrated with making two separate meals every day and wants to just have vegetarian options sometimes.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks she's not. Let me break it down. \n\nFirst, the husband's behavior: he's not open to trying new foods, makes unkind comments, and wastes food without communication. That seems pretty inconsiderate. If he's not willing to try new things or communicate his preferences, that's on him. But the author is trying to accommodate him by making food he'll eat, which might not be ideal for her health goals. She's also trying to eat healthier, which is a personal goal. \n\nIs it fair for her to expect the husband to make an effort? If he's not willing to try healthier options or communicate better, then the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to eat what she needs. The fact that he wastes food without telling her is a big problem. The author feels like she's compromising, but maybe the real issue is his lack of cooperation and respect for her efforts. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they both want to lose weight, but the husband isn't taking action. That adds another layer. If they're in this together, he should be making changes too. But since he's not, the author can't be blamed for sticking to her own plan. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband's behavior is the main problem here. The answer should be B.\n"
