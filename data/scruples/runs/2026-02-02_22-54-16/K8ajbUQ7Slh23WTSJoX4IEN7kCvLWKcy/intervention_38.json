My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to make separate meals for her husband. She wants to eat healthier, loves vegetables, and her husband prefers heavy meals. He even accused her of making broccoli to watch him suffer. She doesn't want to make two meals every day and sometimes wants to have vegetarian dishes. She's tried suggesting lighter meals, but he doesn't pick them. Also, he throws away food he doesn't like at work, which she found out by visiting his workplace. Now she's making meals he'll eat, even if she doesn't like them, to prevent waste. She feels like she's the asshole for both making food he doesn't want and for the waste.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she's in the wrong. The question is whether her actions are justified. She's trying to eat healthier and lose weight, which is a personal goal. Her husband's eating habits are different, and he's not open to trying new things. Making separate meals is a lot of work, and she's not willing to do that daily. Also, the husband is wasting food, which is a problem. She's making compromises by preparing meals he likes, even if they're not ideal for her. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, it's reasonable for her not to want to cook two separate meals every day, especially if he's resistant to trying healthier options. The husband's behavior of throwing away food is wasteful and disrespectful. The author is trying to avoid waste, which is responsible. However, there's a conflict between their dietary preferences. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. The author is making some compromises by adjusting her meals to his preferences, but the husband isn't reciprocating. He's not trying to eat healthier despite wanting to lose weight, which might be an issue. The author's main issue is the extra work and waste, which are valid concerns. \n\nThe husband's accusation about watching him suffer with broccoli is a bit harsh and shows a lack of empathy. The author isn't forcing him to eat broccoli; she's making it for herself and perhaps as an option. His reaction might be part of the problem. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She's trying to manage her health, avoid waste, and minimize the effort in meal preparation. The husband's behavior contributes to the problem, so the answer should be B.\n"
