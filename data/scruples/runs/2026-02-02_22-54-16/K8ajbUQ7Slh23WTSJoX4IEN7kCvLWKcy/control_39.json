My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to cook separate meals. The author wants to eat healthier, loves vegetables, and finds their husband's food preferences (like heavy meals) unappetizing. The husband doesn't like broccoli, makes faces, and has thrown away food he doesn't like. The author is trying to avoid making meals they don't want to eat, which also upsets their stomach, and they feel like they're the asshole for causing waste.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is trying to maintain their health goals, which is a valid personal goal. Cooking for two people with different dietary needs can be challenging. The husband's behavior, like throwing away food without communication, is problematic. He also doesn't seem to be making an effort to try new foods or accommodate his wife's preferences, despite his own weight loss goals. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual effort. The author has tried to discuss lighter meal options with her husband, but he's not responsive. The husband's actions (wasting food) indicate a lack of consideration. The author's refusal to cook meals that either make her sick or are likely to be wasted isn't unreasonable. In relationships, it's important both partners contribute to shared responsibilities and respect each other's needs. Since the husband isn't making an effort to adapt or communicate effectively, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her health and avoiding waste. The husband's behavior seems more at fault here. So, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
