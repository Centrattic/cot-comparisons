My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about cooking meals\u2014she wants to eat healthier, but her husband prefers heavy, less healthy food. She feels she's being the asshole because she's making meals he doesn't like, which he then throws away. She's trying to adjust, but he's not cooperative.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author is trying to eat healthier, which is a personal choice. She's making an effort to eat better, which is reasonable. The husband, on the other hand, has his own preferences and isn't open to trying new things. He even throws away the food she makes if he doesn't like it, which is wasteful. The key points here are about mutual respect in a relationship and shared responsibilities.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I agree. The husband's behavior\u2014throwing away food without communication\u2014is a problem. The author is trying to manage both their needs but is being met with resistance. Making separate meals is a hassle, and the husband isn't contributing to finding a solution. The author's desire to eat healthier shouldn't be the sole responsibility of one person in a shared living situation. The husband's lack of effort to adapt or communicate properly makes him the asshole here. So the answer should be B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
