My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. She wants to eat healthier and likes vegetables, but her husband prefers heavy meals and doesn't like some of her healthier choices. He even made a comment about her making broccoli to watch him suffer. She doesn't want to make two meals every day and is frustrated that he sometimes throws away food she makes if he doesn't like it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common perspectives on shared responsibilities in a household. Cooking is often a shared task, especially if both partners are contributing. If the husband is not willing to try new foods or make lighter meals, maybe he's not doing his part to share the cooking duties. Also, the fact that he wastes food she makes adds to the problem because it shows a lack of consideration.\n\nThe wife's desire to eat healthier is valid. It's her right to make choices for her own health. The husband's behavior of throwing away food without telling her is inconsiderate and could be seen as wasteful. If he's not willing to adapt or contribute, then the wife isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries to avoid waste and to accommodate her own needs.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The wife has asked him to pick lighter meals, but he hasn't responded. If communication isn't working, it's reasonable for her to adjust her cooking to match his preferences to prevent waste, even if it means she's not getting her ideal meals. However, this might lead to her not eating well either. The key issue is the husband's unwillingness to compromise or share the responsibility.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if both partners expect the other to accommodate their preferences without effort from their own side, that's an imbalance. The husband isn't making an effort to try different foods or share cooking duties, so the wife isn't wrong in prioritizing her health and avoiding waste. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the husband's inconsiderate actions and lack of cooperation make her stance reasonable.\n"
