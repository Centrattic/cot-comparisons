My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband because their dietary preferences differ. The husband eats heavy, unhealthy food, and the author wants to eat healthier. The husband has even accused her of making broccoli to make him suffer. She mentions he throws away food he doesn't like at work, which she found out by accident. Now she's making food he likes, even if she doesn't want to eat it, to prevent waste. She feels she's being the asshole for making food he doesn't want and for it being wasted. The husband also wants to lose weight but doesn't seem to take steps like going to the gym or eating healthier.\n\nSo, I need to determine if the author is wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, cooking is a shared responsibility in many relationships, but it's also common for couples to have different preferences. The author is trying to eat healthier, which is a personal goal. The husband's behavior of not trying new foods and discarding leftovers might be contributing to the problem. The key points here are mutual respect and compromise. \n\nThe author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals. It's reasonable to expect some level of compromise from both sides. The husband's reaction to broccoli and throwing away food shows a lack of consideration for the effort put into cooking. If he's not willing to try lighter meals or communicate his preferences, the author has a right to prioritize her own health. Also, the fact that he wastes food, which she found out by visiting his work, indicates he's not being responsible with the meals she prepares. She's making an effort to avoid waste by making what he likes, even if it's not good for her. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could explore other solutions, like eating at different times or using meal prep to have her own healthy options while he has his. But the main issue is whether she's wrong for not cooking separately. Considering the husband's inconsiderate actions, it's more on him to adjust. The author is justified in wanting to eat healthier without having to prepare two meals every day. His behavior of wasting food is a bigger issue. So the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
