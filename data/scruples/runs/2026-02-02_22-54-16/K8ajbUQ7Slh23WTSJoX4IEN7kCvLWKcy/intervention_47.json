My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The author, let's call her A, is struggling with her husband's eating habits. She wants to eat healthier, but he prefers heavy, less healthy meals. She's not willing to cook separate meals every day and feels frustrated that he throws away the food she makes if he doesn't like it. They have communication issues, and he's not open to trying new things.\n\nFirst, the author is clear about her goals: she wants to eat healthier and lose weight. That's a valid personal goal. She's made an effort to ask him about lighter meals, but he's resistant. When she makes meals he doesn't like, he discards them, which leads to waste. She's now making meals she doesn't enjoy just to avoid waste, which is causing her stress.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The husband isn't being considerate of her needs. Throwing away food she prepared without discussing it is disrespectful. On the other hand, the author could be doing more to find a compromise. Maybe suggesting cooking something they can both enjoy, or taking turns with meal choices. But the main issue is her husband's behavior\u2014dismissing her efforts, not trying new foods, and wasting food. \n\nAlso, the author is trying to avoid making two separate meals, which is reasonable. It's a common problem in relationships where dietary needs differ. The husband's lack of flexibility and respect for her health goals seems to be the bigger problem here. While the author could explore more compromises, she's not entirely at fault. The husband's actions are contributing significantly to the conflict. So, I think the answer is B\u2014the author is not in the wrong.\n"
