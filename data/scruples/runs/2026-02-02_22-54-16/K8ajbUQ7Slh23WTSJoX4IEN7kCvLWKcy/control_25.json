My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. The husband has different dietary preferences\u2014he likes heavy, unhealthy food, and he gets finicky. The wife wants to eat healthier, but the husband doesn't like to try new things. She's making meals he'll eat even if she doesn't like them, and he's wasting food when he doesn't like it. She feels like she's the asshole for making food that gets wasted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's behavior is problematic. He's not open to trying healthier options, makes faces at broccoli, and wastes food without telling her. That's disrespectful and wasteful. The wife is trying to manage her own health goals while dealing with his habits. She's already making compromises by making meals he likes, even if they're not good for her. The fact that he's throwing away food without communication adds to the problem. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The husband isn't trying to meet her halfway. He wants to lose weight, but only if he doesn't have to eat healthier or exercise. That's not making an effort. The wife is justified in not wanting to cook separate meals, especially since his actions lead to waste. She's also trying to eat better, which is a valid personal goal. \n\nI think the husband is the one in the wrong here. The wife is trying to balance both their needs, but he's not contributing equally. She's not the asshole for setting boundaries and prioritizing her health. The answer should be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
