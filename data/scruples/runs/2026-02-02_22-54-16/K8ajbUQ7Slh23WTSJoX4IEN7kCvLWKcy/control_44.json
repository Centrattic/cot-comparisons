My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The author doesn't want to cook separate meals for her husband because he prefers heavy, less healthy food, while she wants to eat healthier. The husband throws away food he doesn't like, leading to waste. The author is feeling like she's the asshole for making food that gets wasted.\n\nHmm. So, the main points here are about shared responsibilities in cooking and meal preferences. The author is trying to eat healthier, which is a valid personal goal. The husband isn't willing to compromise or try new foods, which is his choice, but when he refuses to eat what's prepared and wastes it, that's problematic. The author is trying to avoid wasting food by making what he likes, even if it's not good for her. That seems like a reasonable approach since wasting food is undesirable.\n\nThe husband's behavior of throwing away food without communicating is definitely an issue. If he doesn't like the meal, he should say so and not waste it. The author is trying to balance both their needs but feels pressured by the husband's actions. It's a common situation where partners have different dietary needs or preferences. The fact that he accuses her of making broccoli to watch him suffer shows a lack of cooperation and possibly some resentment on his part.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong here. She's making an effort to eat healthier without forcing her preferences on him. The problem lies in the husband's unwillingness to adapt or communicate properly. The author is trying to avoid waste by making meals he'll eat, even if it's not ideal for her. That's a reasonable compromise. The husband's actions (wasting food, not trying new things) are contributing to the problem, not the author's. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
