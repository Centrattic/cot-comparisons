My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote an \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband because of differing dietary preferences. She wants to eat healthier, likes vegetables, and is concerned about waste when he throws away food. Her husband doesn't like lighter meals, eats like a kid, and has a habit of discarding food she makes if he doesn't like it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is trying to meet her health goals, which is a valid personal choice. Cooking separate meals can be time-consuming and maybe stressful. The husband's behavior, like making faces at broccoli and throwing food away without communication, seems dismissive and inconsiderate. He's also resistant to trying lighter options even though he wants to lose weight, which creates inconsistency.\n\nThe key points are mutual respect and communication. If the author is making meals that he ends up wasting, that's not ideal. But the husband's actions (wasting food, not trying new things) add to the problem. The author isn't forcing him to eat anything; she's trying to find a middle ground but he's not cooperating. The fact that he throws away the food without telling her suggests he isn't considering her effort or the cost of the food. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for not making separate meals? Well, it's reasonable for her to want to eat what she likes without overextending herself, especially if he isn't respectful of the food she prepares. The husband's actions (wasting, making faces) indicate he's not being considerate. The author is trying to accommodate his preferences but he's not reciprocating. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't the asshole here. She's making an effort, but the husband isn't contributing to a solution. The problem lies more with his behavior than her decision to prioritize her own dietary needs.\n"
