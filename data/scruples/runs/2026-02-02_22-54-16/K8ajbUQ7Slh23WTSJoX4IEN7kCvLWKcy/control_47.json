My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. The situation is that she wants to eat healthier and likes vegetables, while her husband prefers heavy meals. He's not open to trying new foods, and he even throws away food she makes if he doesn't like it. She's making meals he'll eat, even if she doesn't want to or it upsets her stomach, and she feels like she's the asshole for it.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are her desire to eat healthier, his resistance to trying lighter or healthier foods, the waste of food he doesn't like, and her compromise leading to her own discomfort. \n\nFirst, she's trying to get healthier, which is a valid personal goal. It's common for people to have different dietary needs or preferences. The husband's attitude seems dismissive, like making broccoli is to watch him suffer, which is not supportive. Also, throwing away food he doesn't like is wasteful and shows a lack of communication.\n\nShe's compromising by making meals he'll eat even if they're not good for her, which is a problem because it's affecting her health goals. She's also worried about waste, so she's avoiding making vegetarian dishes, but that's not working for her. \n\nThe husband wants to lose weight but doesn't want to eat healthier, which seems contradictory. He's not engaging in the solution, just avoiding effort. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's not forcing him to eat something; she's making an effort to accommodate him without her needs being met. He's not trying to find middle ground either. She's not wrong for wanting her health goals. Making two meals isn't feasible if he's not open to trying her options. His behavior (throwing away food, not trying new things) is more problematic. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
