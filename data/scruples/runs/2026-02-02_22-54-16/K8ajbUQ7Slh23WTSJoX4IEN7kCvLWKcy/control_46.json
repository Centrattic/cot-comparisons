My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their situation again.\n\nThey don't want to cook separate meals for their husband. They want to eat healthier and love vegetables, but their husband prefers heavy meals like burgers, steak, etc. They mention that he doesn't like broccoli and makes faces when eating it. The husband also eats like a kid and isn't adventurous with food. The author doesn't want to make two meals every day and sometimes wants to eat vegetarian dishes without starchy veggies. They've asked the husband to pick lighter meals, but he doesn't know. When he doesn't like what's made, he throws it away at work without telling them. The author is now mostly making food the husband will eat, even if they don't like it or it makes them sick, to avoid waste. They feel like they're the asshole for making food he doesn't want and causing waste, but they want to get healthy and lose weight. The husband also wants to lose weight but doesn't mind skipping the gym or eating healthier.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? Answer A (yes) or B (no).\n\nLet me break it down. The main issue is cooking separate meals. The author wants to eat healthier, which is their right. The husband's preferences are different. The husband isn't helping by not trying new foods or eating lighter meals. He's also wasteful by throwing away food without communication. The author is making adjustments to avoid waste but it's affecting their own health goals negatively.\n\nFrom what I understand, the author is trying to balance their health goals with their husband's preferences. They're not forcing him to eat something he doesn't like; instead, they're making what he wants, which might not align with their own preferences. However, the husband's behavior of throwing away food is problematic. The author is trying to accommodate him, but it's leading to them not eating what they want, which is important for their health. \n\nIn a relationship, both partners should compromise. If the husband isn't open to trying lighter meals or making an effort, the author shouldn't have to sacrifice their health goals entirely. Making separate meals might be a solution, but the husband's wastefulness complicates things. The author is trying to avoid waste by making what he likes, but that's causing them to eat unhealthily. It's a situation where both could be more flexible. However, the husband isn't contributing to the solution, so the author isn't entirely at fault. \n\nI think the key points are that the husband isn't trying to meet the author halfway and is being wasteful. The author is making efforts to adjust but is now negatively affecting their own health. Since the husband isn't cooperating, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer would be B (no).\n"
