My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about cooking separate meals. The author wants to eat healthier, loves vegetables, but her husband prefers heavy meals like burgers and fried chicken. He even makes faces when eating broccoli, and there's been some issues with him throwing away food she made.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is trying to eat healthier, which is a valid goal. Making separate meals can be time-consuming and maybe stressful. The husband, on the other hand, has his own preferences and maybe isn't as open to trying new things. He also threw away food without telling her, which is disrespectful.\n\nThe author mentions that she's been making meals he likes, even if she doesn't want to eat them. But this is causing her to eat things that upset her stomach. That's a problem because it's affecting her health. The husband wants to lose weight too but doesn't want to go to the gym or eat healthier, which seems contradictory. \n\nThe key points here are about compromise and communication. The author tried to ask him to pick lighter meals, but he's not responsive. He's also wasting food, which is disrespectful. The author is trying to avoid waste by making things he likes, but it's causing her health issues. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the husband's behavior (throwing away food, not trying new things) seems more problematic. The author is trying to balance her health goals with his preferences, but he's not cooperating. So, the blame isn't entirely on the author. She's making an effort to accommodate him, but his actions are causing the problem. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong. The husband's actions are disrespectful and he's not contributing to the solution. The author is trying to maintain her health and reduce waste, which are reasonable goals. The main issues are on the husband's side, so the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
