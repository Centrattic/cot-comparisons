My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals. The husband eats heavy meals, doesn't like veggies, and wastes food. The author wants to eat healthier but ends up making meals that suit him, even if they make her sick.\n\nFirst, the husband's behavior: he doesn't like the healthier options, makes faces, and throws away leftovers without telling her. That's pretty inconsiderate. The author is trying to eat better, which is her choice. She's also concerned about waste, which is reasonable. \n\nNow, the key point is whether she's obligated to make separate meals. In many relationships, it's common for couples to compromise, but if one partner consistently refuses to try new foods or communicate, the other isn't necessarily wrong for not accommodating. The husband's actions (wasting food) indicate he's not contributing to the solution. \n\nAlso, the author mentions he doesn't want to go to the gym or eat healthier unless forced, which shows a lack of effort on his part. The author's desire to eat healthily shouldn't be the sole burden on her. It's reasonable for her to set boundaries, especially when her efforts are met with resistance and waste.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband's behavior is the main issue here. The answer should be B.\n"
