My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to make separate meals for her husband. The author wants to eat healthier and loves vegetables, while her husband prefers heavier meals. He makes unpleasant faces when eating broccoli and even threw away food at work, which she found out about. Now she's mostly making food he likes, even if it upsets her stomach, to avoid waste.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's argument is that she's trying to eat healthier and doesn't want to cook two meals every day. She's also concerned about food waste when her husband throws away the food she prepares. On the other hand, her husband isn't open to trying lighter meals and seems to not appreciate her efforts, leading to tension.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is usually important. However, in this case, the husband isn't making an effort to adapt either. He's not interested in trying new foods, and he's wasteful when he doesn't like what's made. The author has made an effort to ask him about lighter options, but he doesn't respond. The fact that he throws away food without talking about it shows a lack of consideration. \n\nAlso, the author is making an effort to avoid waste by preparing food he likes even if it's not good for her. That seems like she's prioritizing his preferences despite her own discomfort. But she's also trying to maintain her health goals. It's a balance, and she's struggling with it. \n\nI think the key points here are the husband's unwillingness to change and his wasteful behavior. The author isn't at fault for wanting to take care of her health and avoid unnecessary work. She's made reasonable efforts to communicate, but the husband isn't cooperating. Therefore, the answer would be that she's not in the wrong.\n"
