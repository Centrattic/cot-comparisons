      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole for not wanting to cook separate meals for their husband. They want to eat healthier and love vegetables, but their husband prefers heavy meals like burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, and fast food. The husband once joked that she makes broccoli to watch him suffer, and he makes faces when eating it. He's not adventurous with food and tends to just eat what she makes, even if he doesn't like it. The author has asked him to pick lighter meal options, but he never does. If she makes something he doesn't like, he throws it away at work without telling her. She's found the uneaten food in the trash at his workplace. Now, she's mostly making meals he'll eat, even if they're not good for her, to prevent waste. She mentions pasta upsets her stomach but they've had it twice this week. The husband also wants to lose weight but doesn't seem to want to do the work.\n\nThe author feels like she's being the asshole because she's making food he doesn't want and it's getting wasted. She wants to eat better and get healthy but is conflicted about the situation.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author wants to eat healthier, which is a personal choice. The husband has different food preferences, which is also normal. The problem arises when the husband throws away food she made without telling her, leading to waste. The author is adjusting her cooking to fit his preferences to avoid waste, even if it's not ideal for her health or tastes. The husband is making fun of her for making broccoli and not being adventurous with his food, which might indicate he's resistant to trying new things. Also, he wants to lose weight but isn't making the effort to eat healthier or exercise.\n\nNow, considering the typical dynamics in a relationship where cooking is a shared responsibility. If the husband is eating at home but then discarding the food without communication, that's a problem. The author is trying to accommodate him by making meals he likes, even if it's not her preference, to prevent waste. However, she's also making sacrifices by eating less healthy options to avoid making two separate meals. \n\nIn relationships, it's common to find compromises. For example, some couples choose to have one main meal and then each have their own side dishes. Others might take turns making different types of meals. But here, the husband's behavior of throwing away the food without talking to her is disrespectful and leads to waste. The author is trying to find a middle ground by making meals the husband will eat, which is a reasonable compromise. However, she's giving up her own dietary needs to do so. \n\nThe husband's refusal to try lighter meals and his lack of communication about his preferences might be contributing to the problem. If he's not willing to discuss or try alternative options, then the author isn't in the wrong for making adjustments. But if the husband is expecting her to cater to his preferences entirely while he doesn't make any effort, that could be a point where the author is overcompensating.\n\nAlso, the fact that the husband wants to lose weight but isn't making changes except when she cooks for him is a red flag. If he's not willing to try healthier options or exercise, then the author isn't helping him, which he might be blaming her for. But his actions (throwing away food) are clearly problematic. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is trying to balance her health goals and the husband's preferences. The husband's behavior of wasting food without discussion is likely the bigger issue here. The author is making an effort to not waste food, which is responsible, but she's also not getting to eat what she wants. \n\nI think the key points are that the husband is not respectful with the food she prepares and is not making an effort to adapt to her healthier lifestyle. The author is trying to find a solution that works for both, but the husband's actions are causing the problem. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals, especially when the husband isn't appreciative or communicative. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
