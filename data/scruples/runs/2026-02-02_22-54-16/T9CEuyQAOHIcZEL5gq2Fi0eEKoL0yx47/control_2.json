I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a wife showing an old prom dress with cum stains from her past date. The husband is now uncomfortable having it in the house and wants it cleaned, but the wife refuses, saying he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband isn't jealous of her past partners, which is a good sign. The issue is specifically about the physical presence of another person's bodily fluids in their home. The wife's friend made a comment about the stains, and the wife laughed about the incident. The husband's main concern seems to be about the cleanliness and the presence of another man's ejaculate in their shared living space.\n\nMarital boundaries and personal comfort are important here. While the wife has the right to keep mementos from her past, the husband has the right to feel comfortable in his own home. The problem might be that the husband is bringing up a specific issue that the wife sees as a memory, while he sees it as a hygiene or emotional issue. However, the wife's refusal to clean it despite the husband's discomfort could indicate a lack of consideration for his feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's reaction is about an object that the wife has owned for a long time and never considered an issue before. He's only bringing it up now, which might make it seem like a new problem. But the content of the stains is a personal and intimate issue that could affect the husband's sense of privacy and cleanliness in their home. \n\nIt's possible that the husband's request is reasonable given that they now live together, and the presence of another person's ejaculate in the household might be seen as a breach of their current marital space. However, the wife's stance is about her memories and not wanting to erase them, which is also a valid personal right. The question is whether the husband's discomfort is a legitimate reason for the wife to comply. \n\nIn relationships, both partners' feelings should be respected. If the husband is genuinely unsettled by this, it's reasonable for him to express that. However, the wife's refusal without considering his feelings might be seen as dismissive. But if the husband's request is based on jealousy (which he denies), that's different. Since he states he's not jealous but just doesn't want the stains in the house, it's more about personal boundaries. \n\nSo, whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether the husband's request is reasonable. Since the husband is asking for a dry cleaning solution which doesn't erase the memories but removes the physical stain, it's a practical request. The wife's refusal to accommodate this might be the issue. However, if the dress is a significant memory item for her, there's a balance between personal memories and shared living space. \n\nIn conclusion, the husband's stance isn't about jealousy but about the presence of another man's bodily fluids, which is a legitimate concern in a shared home. The wife's refusal to clean it despite his discomfort might be seen as not respecting his boundaries. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. However, if the husband is overstepping by insisting on cleaning something that's her personal memory without her consent, that's another angle. But given the context, it's more about mutual respect for each other's comfort. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because he's addressing a valid concern about the environment they share.\n"
