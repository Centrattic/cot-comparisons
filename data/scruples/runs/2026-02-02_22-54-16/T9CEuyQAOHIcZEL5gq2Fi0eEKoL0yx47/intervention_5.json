I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again and break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's wife has had this prom dress in her closet for years. The author never had an issue with it before. The problem started when the wife showed the dress to a friend, and the friend noticed spots. The wife then mentioned that her date had messed up and they shouldn't have done it. The author found out later, and now he's uncomfortable with the idea of another man's cum stains in their home. He wants the dress cleaned, but the wife refuses, saying he's overreacting and not being jealous. They've been having awkwardness since.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting another man's bodily fluids in his house. Let me think about the key points here.\n\n1. **Respect and Boundaries**: The author is expressing discomfort about something they found out through a friend. The wife might feel her memories are important, but the author has boundaries about having another person's biological fluids in their home. It's about personal space and what each person considers acceptable.\n\n2. **Communication**: The author approached his wife about it after the fact. The wife felt he was overreacting. They've discussed it again, but she still refuses. There's a communication issue here, maybe about how the author brought it up. The wife might feel it was sudden or that he was being possessive. The author might feel he's justified in his request.\n\n3. **Jealousy vs. Discomfort**: The wife mentions not being jealous, but the author is not necessarily jealous of the past. He's uncomfortable with the physical presence of another man's stains. Jealousy is about current or future threats, but here it's about a past event. The author's issue is more about hygiene or boundaries.\n\n4. **Ownership and Consent**: The dress belongs to the wife. She has the right to keep it as a memory. However, they live in the same house, so both have to consider each other's comfort. The author's request is about removing something from their shared home that he finds unacceptable.\n\n5. **Cultural/Societal Norms**: In some contexts, people might find it odd to keep a prom dress with such stains, but others might see it as a cherished memory. The wife's stance is about keeping her memories, while the author wants it removed for his own peace of mind.\n\n6. **Negotiation and Compromise**: The author tried to discuss it again. The wife's refusal might indicate she doesn't see the issue. Maybe a compromise is needed, like the dress being stored elsewhere or both agreeing to let it go once it's cleaned. But the author's stance is that he wants it cleaned, and the wife refuses.\n\n7. **Emotional vs. Physical Discomfort**: The wife has emotional attachment to the dress. The author has physical discomfort. Both have valid feelings, but the question is whether the author overstepped by demanding something that's in the wife's possession and her memories.\n\nNow, considering these points, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, he's requesting something that's in his home and he's uncomfortable with. On the other, the wife has the right to her memories. However, since they live together, they need to respect each other's boundaries. The author isn't being possessive about her past but about the physical object in their home. If the wife refuses to clean it, maybe the author is within his right to demand it, but if the wife feels her memories are being disrespected, that's another angle.\n\nAnother angle: The author didn't have an issue before the incident with the friend. The friend's comment made him aware of the stains. Before that, he didn't know. Now that he's aware, he's uncomfortable. Is it fair for him to ask for it to be cleaned? Or is it overstepping because it's her personal item?\n\nI think it's a matter of mutual respect. The author isn't wrong for being uncomfortable with something in their shared home that he finds unacceptable. The wife isn't wrong for wanting to keep a memory. The problem is they haven't found a compromise. The author's request is reasonable if they live together, as he owns the house (assuming it's their home). If the dress is in her closet but in their house, he has a right to ask for it to be cleaned. However, the wife's refusal could be seen as dismissive of his feelings. But maybe the author's approach was abrupt, given that he didn't know before. Maybe a more collaborative approach would have been better, but the core issue is about their shared space.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
