I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a husband who found out that his wife's prom dress has cum stains from a past sexual encounter. He doesn't mind her past relationships or the fact that she had sex with someone else, but he's uncomfortable having another man's bodily fluids in their home. He asked her to have the dress dry-cleaned, but she refused, saying he was overreacting and that he was being jealous. Now there's tension between them because she won't get it cleaned, and he's still not comfortable with it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the author. He's not jealous of her past partners, which is important. His issue isn't with her having sex before but with the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. That seems more about personal boundaries and cleanliness rather than jealousy. However, the wife's reaction is that he's overreacting and being jealous, which complicates things.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. The husband expressed his discomfort, and the wife dismissed it, which can lead to conflict. But does the husband have a reasonable request? If someone is uncomfortable with bodily fluids in their home, especially from a past relationship, is that a valid concern? Some might argue that once the relationship is past, the memories are personal, and the physical remnants are part of her history. Others might say that in a committed relationship, the partner's comfort regarding such items should be respected.\n\nThe wife's argument is that it's her memory and she doesn't want to erase it. However, the husband is asking for a simple solution\u2014dry cleaning\u2014which doesn't erase the memory but removes the physical stain. The wife's refusal to comply, despite the husband's repeated requests, suggests a lack of willingness to accommodate his feelings, which can be seen as dismissive of his boundaries.\n\nBut then again, does the husband have the right to demand that she clean an item that is hers and has sentimental value? It's a personal item, and the wife might feel that he's overstepping by making her clean it. However, since it's in their shared home, the husband's request for cleanliness and comfort is understandable. The issue here is balancing personal memories with the comfort of a partner.\n\nIn many relationships, mutual respect for each other's boundaries is crucial. If the husband is uncomfortable, he has the right to express that, and the wife's response should ideally be to find a compromise. In this case, dry cleaning is a reasonable solution that doesn't erase the memory but addresses the husband's concerns. The wife's refusal to do so, despite his valid feelings, might be seen as not respecting his boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that her past is her own and that the husband shouldn't impose his standards on her personal items. However, if the item is in the shared living space, the husband's comfort is also a valid consideration. It's a bit of a gray area, but since the husband isn't asking for the dress to be destroyed or for her to forget the memory, just to clean it to remove the stain, it seems like a reasonable request.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. He's expressing his discomfort and asking for a solution that's within his control (dry cleaning), which is a clean and respectful way to handle the situation. The wife's refusal to comply, despite the husband's clear and reasonable request, is where the problem lies. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
