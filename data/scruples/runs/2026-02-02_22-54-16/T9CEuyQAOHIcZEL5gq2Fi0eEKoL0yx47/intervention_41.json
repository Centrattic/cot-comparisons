I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband being upset because his wife's prom dress has cum stains from a past partner and not wanting it in their house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife has had the dress for a long time, and the husband never noticed before. The issue came up when the wife showed the dress to a friend, who commented on the spots, and the wife mentioned it was from her date. Then the husband expressed discomfort about another man's cum stains in their home. The wife is against getting it cleaned, wanting to keep her memories.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, does the husband have a valid reason to be upset? He's not jealous about her past, but the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home is what's bothering him. It's about comfort and personal boundaries. The wife, on the other hand, values the dress as a memory. \n\nI think the husband's reaction is about his personal discomfort, not her past relationships. The wife is not wrong in wanting to keep the dress, but the husband is within his rights to ask for it to be cleaned or removed. However, the wife's refusal might be seen as dismissive of his feelings. \n\nBut the question is whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong. If the husband is expressing his discomfort and asking for a solution (like cleaning), that's reasonable. The wife's response of \"don't be jealous\" might be invalidating his feelings. \n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to respect each other's feelings. If the husband feels that having those stains is a problem for him, he's not wrong to express that. The wife could be more empathetic. However, the husband isn't wrong for having that preference. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
