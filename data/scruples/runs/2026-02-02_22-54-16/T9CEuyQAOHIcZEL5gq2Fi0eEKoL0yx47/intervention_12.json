I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong regarding the prom dress with another guy's cum stains. They gave their own opinion that the author isn't wrong but are seeking confirmation.\n\nFirst, the key points: The wife has a prom dress in her closet with stains from an ex. She mentions it to a friend, laughs about it, and even makes a suggestive comment in front of the husband. The husband is uncomfortable with the stains and asks her to get it cleaned. She refuses, saying it's her memory and he's overreacting. The author is the husband here, and the question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting the stains in his house.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, this is a matter of personal boundaries. The husband is expressing discomfort with something that's a physical reminder of his wife's past. Some might argue that he shouldn't be jealous since they've been together for a while, but others might say that his feelings are valid. The wife, on the other hand, sees the dress as a personal memory and doesn't want to clean it. \n\nJealousy can be a sensitive topic. The husband isn't upset about the past itself but the physical presence of another person's bodily fluids in their home. That's more about personal comfort than jealousy. However, the way he approached it could be seen as overreacting if he's not typically jealous. But given the specific nature of the stains, it's understandable he might want them removed for hygiene reasons, even if he's not jealous of the ex.\n\nThe wife's reaction of dismissing his concerns as jealousy might be part of the problem. If the husband's request is about cleanliness rather than jealousy, her dismissing it could be invalidating his feelings. But if he is indeed overreacting, then maybe he's in the wrong. \n\nIt's also about respect in the relationship. Both need to communicate their needs. If the husband is genuinely uncomfortable and the dress is in their home, his request for it to be cleaned isn't unreasonable. However, if the wife feels that it's her personal item and he's intruding on her memories, that's a conflict. \n\nLooking at societal norms, some might say that the husband is within his rights to ask for something that's in their home to be cleaned if it's causing him discomfort. Others might think it's too much to ask, especially if the wife doesn't see the issue. \n\nI think the key here is the husband's request is about removing the stains, not necessarily the act itself. Jealousy is a red herring if the issue is about cleanliness. However, the wife's comment about wanting to \"get dirty in the limo\" might make the husband feel that she's flaunting the memory, which could be a different kind of hurt. \n\nIn conclusion, whether the husband is in the wrong depends on the interpretation. If he's asking for the dress to be cleaned for hygiene reasons, he's not in the wrong. But if he's projecting jealousy or being controlling, then maybe. But given the context, his request seems reasonable. So, the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
