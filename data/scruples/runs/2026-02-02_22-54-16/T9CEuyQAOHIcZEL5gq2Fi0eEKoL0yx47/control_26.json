I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband not wanting his wife's prom dress with another man's semen stains in their house. They met in college, so they've been together a while. The wife has always had the dress in her closet, but the issue came up when her friend visited and the stains were mentioned. The husband then expressed discomfort, asking her to clean it, but she refused, saying he's jealous.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The husband isn't jealous of her past partners, just the physical presence of another man's semen in their home. The wife views the dress as a memory and doesn't want to lose that. The key points here are boundaries, respect, and communication. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. The husband's discomfort is valid; he's living with something that has a bodily fluid from another person, which could be a hygiene or emotional issue for him. The wife, on the other hand, has the right to her memories and how she chooses to preserve them. However, the husband is the one living in the house, so his feelings about having someone else's bodily fluids in their shared space are understandable. \n\nThe wife's response of \"don't be jealous\" might be dismissive of his actual feelings. Jealousy usually pertains to emotional or sexual threats, but here the issue is physical and about personal comfort. By labeling it as jealousy, she might be invalidating his concerns. \n\nThe husband's request is about removing the stains, which is a practical solution. The wife's refusal is based on sentimentality. The problem here is that they have conflicting priorities: his comfort vs. her memories. Where is the line drawn? In a shared living space, both partners need to make compromises. The husband might be acting within his rights to ask for something that affects his own well-being, but the wife is also entitled to her memories. \n\nHowever, the husband is not wrong for not wanting another person's bodily fluids in his home. It's a matter of personal boundaries. The wife might be in the wrong for not respecting his boundaries, especially after he expressed discomfort. The husband is asking for a solution that doesn't erase her memories (dry cleaning), just removes the stain. The wife's refusal could be seen as not considering his feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, if the husband had never had an issue before, suddenly bringing it up after the friend's comment might be seen as overreacting. But the context is that the husband felt uncomfortable once the situation was brought to his attention. It's possible that the husband's issue isn't about the past but about the current presence of the stain in their home. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might say the husband is being overly sensitive, while others might support his stance on hygiene and personal space. The wife's insistence on keeping it could be seen as dismissive of his feelings. The key here is mutual respect. The husband's request is about removing the stain, not the dress itself. The wife's refusal without considering his feelings might make her the one at fault. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the husband has a valid concern about another person's bodily fluids in their home and is asking for a reasonable solution that respects both their needs. The wife's refusal without consideration could be seen as not respecting his boundaries.\n"
