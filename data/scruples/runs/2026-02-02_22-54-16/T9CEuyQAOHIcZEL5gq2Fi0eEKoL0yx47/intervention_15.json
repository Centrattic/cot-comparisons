I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if the author (the writer of the AITA post) is in the wrong for not wanting their wife's cum-stained prom dress in the house. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife has had this dress in her closet for a long time, and the husband never thought about it before. Then, during a conversation with her friend, the wife mentions that the dress has spots from her date's mess and she didn't take off his jacket before they had sex. The husband later confronts her about the stains, not out of jealousy but because he doesn't want another person's bodily fluids in his home. The wife says she has good memories and doesn't want to clean it, leading to tension.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. The husband's concern is about the presence of another man's semen in their home. Even if he's not jealous, it's a matter of personal hygiene and boundaries. Many people might find that uncomfortable, so isn't it reasonable for him to ask for it to be cleaned? On the other hand, the wife has a sentimental attachment to the dress and her memories. She's been keeping it for years, so maybe she values those memories. \n\nBut the question is about right or wrong. The husband is within his rights to express discomfort with bodily fluids from someone else in the house. The wife, however, might be in the wrong for not considering her husband's feelings once she knows about them. She was aware of his reaction and continued to keep the dress, which could be seen as selfish or dismissive of his boundaries. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for setting a boundary about having another person's bodily fluids in their home. It's a personal choice and hygiene issue, not about past relationships. The wife's refusal to clean it after being asked might be the real issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
