I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a wife's prom dress with stains that she mentions are from a past sexual encounter. The husband is uncomfortable with the stains and wants it cleaned, but the wife refuses, saying he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's main issue isn't the act itself but the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. He's not jealous of her past, which is important. The wife, on the other hand, values the dress for sentimental reasons and doesn't want to get rid of the stains because it's part of her memory. She's also laughing about the situation with her friend, which might show she's not taking the husband's discomfort seriously.\n\nNow, thinking about societal norms and expectations. In a marriage, while personal items and memories are important, there's also an expectation of cleanliness and mutual respect for each other's boundaries. The husband is setting a boundary about what he's comfortable having in their shared home. The wife is respecting her own memories but not acknowledging his boundary, which could be seen as dismissive.\n\nHowever, the wife might argue that the husband's request is unnecessary since he's not jealous. The key here is whether the husband's request is reasonable. Since the stains are from bodily fluids, which are generally considered unhygienic, the husband's concern about cleanliness is valid. The wife's refusal to clean it could be seen as disregarding his feelings, even if she's not being malicious.\n\nAnother angle: the wife's friend made a comment about the stains, indicating they're visible. If the husband is uncomfortable with the presence of someone else's bodily fluids, it's a valid concern. The wife's insistence on keeping the stains might be a conflict between personal memories and shared living space etiquette.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, communication is key. The husband brought it up calmly and the wife dismissed it. The wife might need to consider why the husband is now upset when he wasn't before. Maybe the trigger was the friend's comment, making the issue more salient. The husband's request isn't about the past but about the current living situation. The wife's refusal without compromise could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nBut some might argue that the husband is being overly controlling or not respecting her memories. However, given that the issue is about hygiene and shared space, the husband's stance is more about his comfort in their home. The wife's refusal to clean it, despite the husband's discomfort, could be seen as prioritizing her own feelings over his, which is a common issue in relationships.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: the husband is setting a boundary about hygiene and cleanliness in their home, which is reasonable. The wife is refusing to respect that boundary, which could be seen as wrong. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the husband not being in the wrong (B). However, it's a nuanced situation where both could have room for compromise. But based on the question, the user is asking if the author (husband) is in the wrong. Since he's the one setting a boundary and the wife is not respecting it, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
