I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the wife has a prom dress with cum stains from a past partner, and the husband doesn't want it in the house. They had an argument about it.\n\nFirst, the husband says he's not jealous about her past partners, but the issue is the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. The wife argues that it's a memory she cherishes and that the husband is overreacting. The husband is uncomfortable with it and wants it cleaned. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The husband's right to his own comfort in the home is important. Even if he's not jealous, the thought of another person's bodily fluids might be gross to him. On the other hand, the wife has the right to keep personal mementos from her past, especially if it's not causing harm beyond his discomfort. \n\nBut wait, the dress is in their shared home. The husband is the one who's now objecting. The wife didn't mention it was an issue before. Maybe the husband is overstepping if the dress was there before their marriage. But they are married now, so the home is a shared space. The husband's discomfort is valid, but the wife's right to her memories might also be valid. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the husband could suggest a solution that respects both feelings, like getting it professionally cleaned so it's removed without destroying the memory. Or maybe the wife could store it elsewhere if possible. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's not being jealous but just uncomfortable with the physical presence, does that make him in the wrong? If he's being reasonable in asking for cleanliness, maybe not. However, if the dress is a personal item from her past, is it his place to dictate its presence in the home? Since it's their home, maybe he does have a say. \n\nI think the key here is mutual respect. The husband's feelings are valid, but the wife's memories are also important to her. The issue is whether the husband's request is unreasonable. Since the dress is in the house they share, and it's causing discomfort, he's not necessarily in the wrong. However, if it was there before they married, maybe she should have considered his feelings. But since the problem only arose after the incident when the friend was there and the stain was mentioned, maybe the husband's reaction is justified. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because his discomfort is valid, and it's reasonable to ask for cleanliness in their shared home. The wife's memories are important, but the husband has a right to his own comfort. The solution might involve compromise, but the husband isn't in the wrong for expressing his discomfort.\n"
