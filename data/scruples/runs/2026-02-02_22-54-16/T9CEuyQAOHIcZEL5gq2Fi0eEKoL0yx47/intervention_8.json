I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author is married to his wife, and they've been together for a long time. He's not jealous about her past partners, but there's this prom dress she's kept for years. The problem comes up when her friend visits, and they talk about prom dresses. The wife shows her old dress, which has stains, and mentions that her date \"made a mess.\" Then she says something playful about wishing they could have gotten dirty in the limo. The author is uncomfortable with the idea of another guy's cum stains in their house and asks her to have it dry-cleaned. She refuses, saying he's overreacting and not to be jealous. The issue remains, and they're having awkwardness.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. He's not jealous of her past per se, but the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home is a new issue. He's asking her to clean it, which is a reasonable request if he finds it gross or uncomfortable. However, the wife is holding onto the dress for sentimental reasons, which she associates with good memories. She might see the author's request as an overreaction or unnecessary intrusion into her personal history.\n\nFrom the wife's side, she might feel that her memories are important and that the author shouldn't want to erase them. She could also feel that his request is about control or jealousy, even though he claims it's not about that. The fact that he only brought it up after the friend left might make her feel like it's an issue now when it wasn't before, which could lead to resentment.\n\nLegally, she owns the dress, so he can't force her to clean it unless they have some sort of agreement. Emotionally, the author is dealing with discomfort from something that's not about his past but his wife's. It's a matter of personal boundaries and how they manage shared living spaces. He might have a point in feeling uncomfortable, but he's also in a position where he has to respect her feelings and memories.\n\nPossible angles: Is the author justified in his discomfort? Is the wife being unreasonable by not cleaning it? Could they find a compromise, like having it cleaned but keeping the dress? The wife's use of the word \"jealous\" might be a defense mechanism if she feels attacked. The author might need to communicate better, but he's also within his rights to ask for cleanliness in their home. However, if the dress is a sentimental item, throwing it out or cleaning it could be seen as destroying her memories. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's expressing a legitimate discomfort about something in their shared home. However, he might need to approach it more sensitively. The wife's refusal isn't necessarily wrong either, as it's her personal item with sentimental value. So maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong, but there's room for compromise. But the question is specifically about being in the wrong, not about the best solution. Since he's asked her to clean it and she's refused, and he's not forcing her, the answer is probably B.\n"
