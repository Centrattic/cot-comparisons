I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband not wanting his wife's prom dress, which has semen stains from a past partner, to be in their house. He asked her to get it dry-cleaned, but she refused, saying he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband isn't jealous about her past, which she clarifies. But the issue is the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. That's a real, tangible thing. Even if he's not emotionally jealous, the thought of that in the house could be a valid concern. Some people might find that gross or uncomfortable, regardless of the emotional aspect.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife has good memories associated with the dress and might see it as part of her history. She might feel that her partner is overstepping by making her clean it, especially since he didn't have a problem before. The key here is consent and mutual respect in the relationship. The husband is expressing a legitimate discomfort, even if it's not jealousy. The wife's dismissal of his feelings as jealousy might be invalidating his concerns.\n\nBut is the husband in the wrong for wanting the stains removed? I don't think so. It's about personal boundaries and hygiene. He's not asking her to erase the memory, just to clean the physical remnants of another person's bodily fluids. If they live together, it makes sense that he'd want their home to be free of such things. The wife's refusal could be seen as disrespectful to his feelings. However, she also has the right to her own memories. But in this case, the husband's request seems reasonable. The answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
