I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's prom dress with another guy's semen stains in their house. The story describes a situation where the wife brings up the dress, mentions the stains, and the husband is uncomfortable. He asks her to have it dry-cleaned, but she refuses, saying he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The husband says he's not jealous of her past partners, but the mention of another guy's semen in the house is causing him discomfort. It's important to note that he's not upset about the affair itself but the biological remains. The wife, on the other hand, values the memories associated with the dress and doesn't see the issue.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, both parties have valid points. The husband's discomfort is about a physical object in their home that he finds icky or unhygienic. The wife's stance is about preserving her memories. Now, whether the husband is in the wrong depends on societal norms and personal boundaries. In many relationships, partners have different comfort levels, and what's acceptable to one might not be to the other. Since he's not objecting to her past but the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids, it's more about his personal boundaries than jealousy. \n\nHowever, the wife's refusal to clean the dress might be seen as dismissive of his feelings. If the husband has communicated his discomfort and the wife continues to keep the item, it could be seen as her being in the wrong for not respecting his boundaries. But from the husband's point of view, he's within his right to feel that way and express it. \n\nLegally, there's no law about keeping such an item. Socially, some might say the husband is being overly sensitive, while others support his right to a clean home. In a healthy relationship, both should work together to find a compromise. The key here is mutual respect. The husband has the right to his feelings, and the wife should consider them even if they differ from her own. But if the husband is the only one pushing for it to be cleaned, and the wife is firm in her refusal, it's a conflict of values. \n\nIn conclusion, the husband isn't being unreasonable to express his discomfort. The wife's refusal to accommodate his request might be seen as not respecting his feelings, but the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for having those feelings. The answer would lean towards the husband not being in the wrong (B) because he's voicing his personal boundaries, even if the wife doesn't agree.\n"
