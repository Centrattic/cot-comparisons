I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a wife's prom dress with another guy's cum stains, and the husband is upset about it. The key points here are about boundaries, respect in the relationship, and personal comfort.\n\nFirst, the husband didn't mind his wife's past relationships and had never noticed the dress before. The issue came up when the friend mentioned the stains and the wife made a joke about it. The husband then expressed discomfort about the stains being in their home. \n\nHe's not upset about the affair itself but the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their house. The wife, on the other hand, feels it's part of her memories and refuses to clean it. \n\nMarriage often involves compromises. The husband's discomfort is valid because he's the one currently married to her. Even if the dress is a memory for her, the husband's feelings about the physical presence of another man's residue in their home matter. The wife might see it as her right to keep the dress, but the husband's boundaries need to be respected too. \n\nSo, the question is whether his reaction is justified. Since he's not being jealous of her past but about the current situation in their home, it's more about mutual respect and setting boundaries. The wife is being dismissive of his feelings by calling him jealous, which might not be fair. \n\nTherefore, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong. He has the right to ask for the dress to be cleaned if it makes him uncomfortable. The wife's refusal without considering his feelings might be the issue here. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
