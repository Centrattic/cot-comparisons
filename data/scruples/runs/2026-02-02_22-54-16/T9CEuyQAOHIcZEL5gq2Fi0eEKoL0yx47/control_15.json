I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband being uncomfortable with his wife's prom dress that has cum stains from a past partner. The key points to consider here are about boundaries, respect, and consent in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the husband wasn't jealous about her past partners before, but this specific situation with the dress and the stains is causing him discomfort. He asked her to have it cleaned, but she refused, saying he's overreacting. The question is whether his reaction is justified.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, both partners should respect each other's feelings. If the husband is uncomfortable with something, even if it's not about jealousy, it's important to address that. However, the wife is holding onto a personal memory, which she values. The problem is that the husband's request is about something that's not directly affecting their relationship, but it's a matter of personal hygiene or comfort.\n\nOn one hand, the husband has the right to feel uncomfortable about another person's bodily fluids in his home. On the other hand, the wife has the right to keep mementos from her past as long as they don't harm their relationship. The issue might be about communication and whether the husband's request is reasonable.\n\nBut wait, the husband isn't objecting to her past relationships but specifically to the physical presence of another man's cum in their home. That's a different issue. It's about personal space and hygiene. However, the wife might see it as an overreaction because it's a dress from her teenage years, and she's not doing anything to provoke him now.\n\nThe question is whether the husband's discomfort is valid. Since he's not jealous but just doesn't want another man's body fluids in the house, it's more about personal boundaries. In that case, he's not wrong for feeling that way. However, the wife's right to keep her memories should also be respected. But if he's asking her to clean it, maybe he's overstepping if she's not willing to comply.\n\nBut in a relationship, mutual respect is key. If the husband is genuinely uncomfortable, it's reasonable to ask for a solution. The wife's refusal to clean it might be dismissive of his feelings. However, the husband might need to consider her emotional attachment to the dress. The answer could hinge on whether the husband's request is about hygiene or about jealousy masked as discomfort.\n\nGiven that the husband explicitly states he's not jealous of her past partners, his issue is with the physical stains. Therefore, he's not wrong for wanting them removed from his home. The wife, however, might not be wrong for refusing if she values the dress as a memory. But since the husband is asking her to clean it, and she's refusing without consideration, the onus is on her not to disregard his feelings. However, the husband might be in the right to want the stains removed if it's a matter of personal cleanliness in their shared home.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's expressing his discomfort about something in their home that's not directly related to their relationship but affects his sense of cleanliness and comfort. However, if the wife's refusal is based on her right to keep personal items, there's a counterpoint. But the husband's request is about his comfort in their own home, which is valid. So, he's not in the wrong.\n"
