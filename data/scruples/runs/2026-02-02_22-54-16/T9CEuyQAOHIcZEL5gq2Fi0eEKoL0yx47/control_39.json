I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband being uncomfortable with his wife's prom dress that has cum stains from a past partner. He wants her to get it dry-cleaned, but she refuses, saying he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The husband's main issue is not about jealousy over past relationships but about the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. He's clear that he doesn't care about the sexual history but the actual stains. The wife, on the other hand, values the memories associated with the dress and doesn't see the issue.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is the husband justified? It's his home, so he has the right to set boundaries regarding what's in their house. However, the wife might argue that this is a personal item with sentimental value, and the husband is overstepping by making a big deal about it. The key here is whether the husband's request is reasonable.\n\nThe stains are a health concern. Even if they're old, bodily fluids can carry pathogens, so cleaning might be a valid health and safety issue. On the other hand, the wife's right to keep a personal item should be respected. But since it's their home, the husband might have a point in wanting it cleaned for cleanliness. However, if the dress isn't being used and is just in the closet, maybe the issue is about control or discomfort. The husband is asserting his comfort level, but the wife is resisting, seeing it as unnecessary.\n\nThe problem might be communication. The husband didn't object before, and suddenly bringing it up could make him seem like he's being controlling. But the timing isn't specified; the issue arose when the friend commented on the stains. The husband's reaction is about his current discomfort, not past actions.\n\nIs it about jealousy? The husband says he's not jealous, but the wife's comment about the \"limo\" might have triggered something. But he's clear it's the substance, not the memories. The wife's refusal to clean it despite his request is a point of contention.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the husband is expressing a valid concern about his home's cleanliness, which is reasonable. The wife's refusal might be due to sentimental reasons, but she's not being asked to throw it away, just to clean it. However, if the dress isn't a health risk, maybe the husband is being overly cautious. Still, the presence of another person's bodily fluids might be a reasonable concern for some. \n\nSo, considering all this, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting it cleaned, but the wife's stance is also understandable. However, the husband is trying to enforce a boundary in their shared home, which is his right. The answer might lean towards the husband not being wrong, so answer B.\n"
