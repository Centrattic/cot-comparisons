I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote this (the husband) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's prom dress with another guy's cum stains in their house. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife had a prom dress with stains from her ex's cum. The husband only became aware because a friend commented on the stains, and then the wife made a joke about it. The husband then expressed discomfort and asked her to get it cleaned, but she refused, saying he's overreacting and that it's part of her memories. Now they're having an awkward situation.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal boundaries, mutual respect in a relationship, and whose feelings take precedence. The husband is uncomfortable with the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. On the other hand, the wife values the dress as a memory and doesn't see the issue since the husband didn't mind before.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The husband's right to feel uncomfortable about something that's in their shared home. Even if he's not jealous about her past, the physical presence of another person's bodily fluids might be a hygiene or emotional issue for him. However, the wife has a right to her memories and might feel that her partner is overstepping by making her remove a sentimental item.\n\nBut is the husband in the wrong? Well, he's asking for something that's in their home and affecting him. The dress is in their house, so their living space is shared. If the presence of the stain makes him uncomfortable, it's reasonable for him to express that. However, the wife's refusal to comply might indicate that he's not respecting her feelings about the dress. But does that make him wrong?\n\nAlso, the wife brought the dress out in front of her friend and made a joke about it, which might have been part of what triggered the husband's discomfort. Maybe she didn't realize how he'd feel about it until she mentioned it. But he's now trying to address it, which is valid. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that once the stain is there, it's part of the past and not something that should be a problem. The husband's request is about removing it, which could be seen as a boundary issue. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to respect each other's boundaries. If the husband is uncomfortable with the dress in the house, he has a right to express that. The wife's response of not caring and refusing to clean it might be dismissive of his feelings. However, if the husband never cared before and this is a new issue, maybe he's bringing it up for a reason. \n\nBut is it his place to make her clean it? The dress is hers, and she may have a right to keep it. However, since it's in their home, mutual agreement on what's acceptable in the shared space is important. \n\nSo, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing his discomfort. The question is whether he's overstepping by insisting she remove it. If the wife refuses, maybe he's not wrong for trying to communicate his needs, but he also needs to consider her feelings. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the husband is in the wrong if he's overreacting to something that's in the past and not affecting them directly. But if the presence of the stain is a hygiene issue for him, that's a valid concern. \n\nI think it's a balance. The husband isn't wrong for not wanting the stain in their house, as it's his right to be comfortable in their shared space. The wife isn't wrong in holding onto her memories. But the husband's insistence might be seen as overstepping if the wife is unwilling to comply. \n\nHowever, since the husband is the one who brought it up and is now trying to address it, he's not in the wrong. The wife's refusal could be the issue, but the question is about the husband's responsibility. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's expressing his discomfort about something in their shared home, and it's reasonable for him to request it be cleaned if it's affecting him. The wife's refusal is her choice, but he's not wrong for asking.\n"
