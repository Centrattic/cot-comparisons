I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband not wanting his wife's prom dress, which has stains from another guy, to be in their house. The wife is upset and says he's being jealous, but he's not necessarily jealous of the past relationship but more about the physical reminder of another man's presence in their home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the husband's perspective. He's not upset about her past sex life, just the fact that the dress is still in their home with those stains. It's about personal comfort and maybe the idea of another man's bodily fluids in their shared living space. That's a common concern in relationships where one partner is uncomfortable with certain remnants of the other's past. \n\nOn the wife's side, she has positive memories associated with the dress and doesn't want to get rid of it. She argues that it's not about being jealous, but the husband might feel that the dress is a constant reminder of her past, which could be unsettling for him. The friend's comment about the stains probably brought it to his attention in a way that made him uncomfortable.\n\nNow, relationship dynamics vary. Some people are okay with their partner's past, but when it comes to physical objects that symbolize that past, it can be a different story. The husband's request is about removing a stain, which is a practical matter. The wife is resistant, possibly seeing it as erasing her memory. But the husband's main issue is not the memory itself but the presence of another man's biological material in their home. \n\nIs it unreasonable for him to ask for it to be cleaned? From a health and personal preference standpoint, no. Bodily fluids can carry bacteria, so having an old dress with such stains might be a hygiene issue. Plus, the emotional aspect of seeing those stains, even if it's just a dress, can be a source of discomfort. \n\nThe wife's reaction of calling him overreacting and being jealous might be dismissive of his actual feelings. If he's not jealous about the past partner but just the stain, then her labeling it as jealousy could be the problem. It's possible she's not respecting his boundaries. \n\nHowever, the husband's approach could be better. He might need to communicate his discomfort without making it about being \"wrong\" for the wife to have the dress. Maybe the issue is that he wants the dress cleaned for his own peace of mind, not necessarily to erase her history. The wife's refusal to clean it, despite the husband's request, could be seen as not respecting his feelings. \n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, the husband isn't being jealous of the past, but he's asking for a practical solution to a personal discomfort. The wife is holding onto the dress for sentimental reasons but isn't considering his feelings. The husband is not in the wrong for expressing his discomfort. The wife is in the wrong for not respecting his wishes. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
