I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation (AITA) is in the wrong. The key issue here is the husband's discomfort with his wife's prom dress having stains from a previous sexual encounter. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband says he's not jealous of her past partners, but the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home is making him uncomfortable. He's asking her to have the dress cleaned. The wife, on the other hand, values the dress as a memory and refuses to clean it, saying he's overreacting.\n\nNow, the question is about right and wrong. The husband's request is about making his home environment more hygienic, which is a reasonable concern. Bodily fluids can carry health risks, and having them in the home might be a valid concern. However, the wife's perspective is about preserving memories, which is also a personal right. But does that outweigh the husband's comfort and safety?\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The husband brought this up after years of not noticing, which might make the wife feel like he's suddenly judging her past. However, his request isn't about her past actions but about the physical presence of the stain in their home. \n\nLegally and socially, there's no law against keeping a stained dress, but it's more about mutual respect and comfort. Since the husband is the one who's uncomfortable and is asking for a reasonable solution (cleaning), it's about respecting each other's feelings. The wife's refusal without considering his feelings might be seen as dismissive. \n\nOn the flip side, if the husband never had an issue before, bringing it up now could be seen as overreacting. But the wife's friend mentioned the stain, which might have triggered the husband's concern. It's possible the husband didn't know about the stain until then, so his reaction isn't based on prior knowledge. \n\nThe wife's argument that \"don't be jealous\" could be invalidating his feelings. Jealousy isn't the issue here; it's about hygiene and comfort. The husband isn't jealous of the past partner but is uncomfortable with the physical reminder in their home. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband's request is reasonable. He's not asking her to erase her past but to clean the stain to make their home more comfortable for both. The wife's refusal without discussion could be seen as neglecting his feelings. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband is not in the wrong here. He's expressing a legitimate concern about his home environment and is seeking a solution that doesn't infringe on his wife's memories but respects his comfort. The wife's dismissal of his feelings might be the issue here, not the husband's request.\n"
