I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's prom dress with another guy's cum stains in their house. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been married for a while, they met in college. The wife has had the prom dress in her closet for a long time. The author didn't care before, but when he found out the dress has stains from her ex's cum, he wants it cleaned. The wife is upset, doesn't want to clean it, says it's her memory. The author is saying he's not jealous, but doesn't want another guy's bodily fluids in the house. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, from his perspective, he's not upset about the sex with other people, just the physical presence of the stains. He's asking her to clean it for hygiene reasons. But she's attached to the memories. \n\nI think there's a difference between being okay with her past and the physical reminder. But does the author have a right to ask her to remove or clean something that's a personal memento? Maybe he's overstepping if it's her personal item. On the other hand, he's entitled to his comfort in their home. \n\nBut wait, the wife's argument is her memories versus his discomfort. The key here might be communication and mutual respect. If he's not upset about her past, just the stains, maybe he's focusing on a physical object rather than the emotions. The wife might feel that he's being possessive or not respecting her past. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because he's expressing his comfort in the home. However, the wife also has her feelings. But since he's not jealous about her past, maybe his stance is valid. The problem is their communication. So maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted because it's about personal boundaries versus respecting her memories. But since the author isn't upset about the relationship, just the physical stains, maybe he's right to ask for cleaning. So B.\n"
