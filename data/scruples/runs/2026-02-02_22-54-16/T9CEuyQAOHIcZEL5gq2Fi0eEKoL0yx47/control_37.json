I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong regarding their wife's prom dress with another guy's cum stains. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife has had the dress in her closet for a long time, and the husband never noticed until they discussed it with a friend. The key points here are the husband's sudden discomfort, the wife's attachment to the dress as a memory, and the husband's request to have it cleaned.\n\nThe husband is upset about the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. Even though he mentions he's not jealous about her past, the presence of the stains is making him uncomfortable. The wife feels that these are her memories and refuses to clean the dress, thinking the husband is overreacting.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationship dynamics. In a marriage, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. The husband is expressing a legitimate discomfort about something in their shared home. The wife, on the other hand, is attached to the item for sentimental reasons. But is the husband's request reasonable?\n\nThe husband isn't asking for the dress to be destroyed; he just wants it cleaned or removed from the house. The wife's refusal to comply is causing tension. The question is whether the husband is being unreasonable for not wanting another man's stains in his home. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the husband has the right to feel uncomfortable about this. The wife's argument that the husband is jealous is a possible misinterpretation. The husband's stance is more about cleanliness and personal boundaries rather than jealousy. \n\nHowever, the wife's right to hold onto her memories is also valid. The conflict arises from differing values: one prioritizes cleanliness and personal space, the other values sentimental memories. \n\nIn many relationships, the expectation is mutual respect and compromise. The husband's request is straightforward, but the wife is refusing. The question is whether the husband is overstepping by making her remove the dress. \n\nConsidering that the husband only brought it up after the incident with the friend, there's a possibility he's overreacting to a new situation. However, his discomfort is real. The wife's refusal to address it could be seen as dismissive of his feelings. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties should communicate and find a solution. But the question is specifically about who is in the wrong. The husband's request seems reasonable, given that it's about his comfort in their home. The wife, while attached to the dress, could consider the husband's feelings and maybe find a way to keep the dress elsewhere if cleaning is not an option. \n\nSo, in conclusion, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting the stains removed. The wife's refusal to comply might be contributing to the issue, but the husband's stance is about his personal boundaries. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
