I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong regarding his wife's prom dress with another man's stains. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband and wife are married, and he's not jealous of her past. The issue here is specifically about the physical remnants of her past\u2014cum stains on the dress. The question is about ownership and comfort in their shared living space.\n\nThe husband's main objection is about not wanting another man's bodily fluids in their home. That's a valid concern for some people, even if they're not jealous. He's not upset about the act itself, but the presence of a different person's biological material in their house. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife has emotional attachments to the dress and her memories. She doesn't see the issue since she's in a committed relationship now. She might view it as her personal history, which she's entitled to keep. However, the husband is sharing the living space, so his comfort matters too.\n\nMarriage involves compromise. The husband is setting a boundary about what he's comfortable with in their home, which is reasonable. The wife is also within her rights to have personal items, but she's dismissing his feelings as overreacting. \n\nIs he being unreasonable? It depends on mutual respect. He's not asking her to erase her past but to clean an item that's in their shared home. She's refusing, which could be seen as not respecting his boundary. But he could also consider her emotional connection to the dress. However, since he's the one uncomfortable with the physical presence, it's his right to ask for cleaning. \n\nThe wife's response of \"don't be jealous\" might be invalidating his feelings, which could be part of the problem. He's not being jealous of the past relationship but about the current living situation. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the husband is asserting his boundary, which is valid. The wife is holding onto her memories, which is also valid. However, in a shared home, respecting each other's boundaries is key. If the husband clearly communicated his discomfort and the wife refuses to accommodate, that could be seen as her being in the wrong. But maybe not entirely. \n\nAlternatively, if the husband had never mentioned it before and only brought it up after the friend's comment, perhaps he's overreacting. But given that he's stating he's not jealous and it's about the physical presence, it's a personal preference. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because he's expressing his discomfort in a shared space. But it's a situational judgment. However, since he's the one setting a boundary and she's refusing, maybe the answer is B (No, he's not wrong). But some might argue he's being overly sensitive. I need to decide based on common perspectives. In many cases, people might side with the husband's right to a clean home environment, so the answer is B.\n"
