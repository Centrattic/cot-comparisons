I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author's wife has a prom dress that's been in her closet for a long time. The author wasn't concerned about it until the wife showed it to a friend and mentioned that the previous date was \"a mess\" and \"should have taken off before we did it.\" The friend noticed spots, which the wife admitted were from her ex. The author then expressed discomfort about having another man's semen stains in their house, asking her to get it dry-cleaned. The wife reacts by saying the author is jealous and overreacting, and refuses to clean it.\n\nFirst, the author is not jealous of her past sexual history, which they clarify. The main issue is the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. From a health and cleanliness perspective, having bodily fluids from someone else in the house could be a concern. Even if it's a sentimental item, the author has a right to be concerned about potential health risks, especially if there's uncertainty about the previous partner's health status.\n\nHowever, the wife sees the dress as a memory and is resistant to removing it. This creates a conflict between the author's comfort and the wife's emotional attachment. The author is trying to communicate a boundary about what they're comfortable having in their home, which is a valid personal boundary. The wife's reaction of calling the author jealous might be unfair, given the author isn't upset about her past but the physical presence of the stain.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's right to set boundaries about what's in their home, the wife's right to sentimental items, and the health/sanitation aspect. The author isn't wrong for wanting the dress cleaned or removed. The wife is also not wrong for keeping it, but the author's request is reasonable. The conflict arises because the wife isn't respecting the author's boundary. So, the author isn't in the wrong; they're asserting a personal boundary. The wife's refusal might be the issue here, but the question is about the author's position. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
