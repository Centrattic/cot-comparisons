I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a wife's prom dress with cum stains from a past partner, and the husband not wanting it in their house.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband isn't jealous of her past but is uncomfortable with the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. He asked her to get it cleaned, but she refuses, saying he's overreacting. The wife sees it as a memory and doesn't want to change anything.\n\nSo, is he wrong? Well, the husband's feelings about having a previous partner's bodily fluids in their house seem valid. Even if he's not jealous, personal boundaries matter. The fact that she's been keeping the dress for a long time without him noticing until now might indicate that he's not being unreasonable. However, the wife has a right to her memories and might not see the stains as a big deal. \n\nBut the key here is about mutual respect in the relationship. If the husband finds it offensive and has communicated that, isn't it reasonable for her to consider his feelings? On the other hand, she might feel her autonomy is being challenged. \n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong because he's expressing a valid discomfort without being jealous. The wife's refusal to clean it shows she's not respecting his boundary. So the answer is B.\n"
