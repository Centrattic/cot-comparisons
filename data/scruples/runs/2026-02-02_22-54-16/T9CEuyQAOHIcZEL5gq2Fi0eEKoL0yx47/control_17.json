I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who's upset that his wife's old prom dress has cum stains from a past partner and doesn't want it in their house. The wife is keeping it despite his objections.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that he doesn't want another man's bodily fluids in their home. That's a common concern about cleanliness and personal boundaries. He might feel uncomfortable or grossed out, even if he's not jealous. The wife, on the other hand, has emotional memories attached to the dress and sees it as part of her history. She might feel that her husband is overreacting or being controlling.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. Legally, maybe not, because it's about personal preferences. But in terms of social norms and relationships, it's more about respect and compromise. The husband has a right to his feelings, but he should also respect his wife's memories. However, he's also within his rights to ask for the dress to be cleaned if it makes him uncomfortable. The wife's refusal might be seen as dismissive of his feelings.\n\nI need to check if there's a violation of any norms. The husband isn't being violent or abusive; he's expressing discomfort. The wife isn't obligated to clean the dress if she doesn't want to, but she's making a point about not being jealous. The key here is whether the husband's request is reasonable. Since it's about cleanliness, it's a valid concern. However, the wife's right to her own memories is also valid. \n\nIn relationship advice, both parties need to find a middle ground. The husband might need to communicate better, and the wife might need to consider his feelings. But in terms of who's in the wrong, it's a bit of a toss-up. However, the husband is not wrong for having a boundary about bodily fluids in his home. The wife is also not wrong for keeping a memento. However, since he's the one asking her to change something for his comfort, and she's refusing, maybe he's not in the wrong. But maybe he could have approached it differently. Wait, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. Because he's expressing his discomfort, which is valid. The wife's response might be dismissive, but he isn't wrong for having that feeling. The issue is more about differing values and how they handle it. So neither is entirely wrong, but since the question is about the author, the answer is B.\n"
