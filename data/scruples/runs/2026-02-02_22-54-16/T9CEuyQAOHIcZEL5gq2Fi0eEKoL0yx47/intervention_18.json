I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the husband is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's old prom dress with another man's cum stains in their house. \n\nFirst, the situation: The wife has had the dress in her closet for a long time. The husband never cared before. The issue arose when the friend commented on the stains, revealing the origin. The husband then expressed discomfort about having another man's bodily fluids in their home, even though he's not jealous. The wife is upset, saying he's overreacting and that it's her memory.\n\nSo, the key points here are about boundaries and mutual respect in a marriage. The husband is making a request based on his comfort level. Even though he isn't jealous, he's uncomfortable with the presence of another man's cum. Is that a valid concern? Well, personal hygiene and comfort are subjective. If he's not okay with it, it's his right to express that. However, the wife feels it's her memory and that he's overreacting. \n\nBut wait, the husband is in a committed relationship now. The presence of another man's bodily fluids in their shared home might be a matter of personal boundaries. Even if the wife has a sentimental attachment, the husband's request is about maintaining a certain standard in their home. It's reasonable for someone to ask that their partner clean something that's causing them discomfort, especially if it's a health or cleanliness issue. \n\nHowever, the wife's argument is about her memories. There's a balance here between respecting each other's feelings. The husband isn't asking for the dress to be discarded, just cleaned. If cleaning the dress doesn't erase the memory but makes the husband more comfortable, maybe that's a fair compromise. But the wife is refusing, which could lead to ongoing tension.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he's not being jealous or controlling, just stating his discomfort. However, maybe he should consider that the wife's attachment is emotional. But in a marriage, partners should consider each other's feelings. If the husband finds the presence of cum stains unsettling, he has the right to ask for cleaning. The wife's refusal might be where the issue lies, not the husband's request. \n\nSo, based on this analysis, the author (husband) isn't in the wrong for expressing his discomfort. The problem might be the wife not respecting his request, but the question is about the author's wrongness. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
