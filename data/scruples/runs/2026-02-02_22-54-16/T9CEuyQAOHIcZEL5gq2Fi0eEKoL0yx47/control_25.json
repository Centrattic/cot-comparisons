I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband not wanting his wife's prom dress with another man's cum stains in their house. The wife is keeping it despite his objections.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's main issue is the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. Even though he's not jealous of her past, the physical presence of those stains is making him uncomfortable. He's asking her to clean it, which is a reasonable request for hygiene and personal comfort.\n\nOn the wife's side, she has emotional attachments to the dress and her memories. She doesn't see the stains as a big deal and is upset that he's bringing up her past. She might feel that he's being overly critical or not respecting her history. \n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is wrong. Legally, there's no issue. Emotionally, it's a matter of mutual respect. The husband is expressing his discomfort, which is valid. He's not asking for her to erase her past but to clean an item that's in their shared home. The wife, however, is resisting because of her emotional connection to the dress. \n\nMarriage involves compromise. The husband has the right to his feelings, but the wife also has the right to her memories. However, since the dress is in their home and causing conflict, maybe the husband's request for it to be cleaned is reasonable. If the wife refuses, that's her choice, but the husband isn't wrong for wanting it cleaned. \n\nThe key here is that the husband isn't being jealous over her past relationships but is concerned about the physical presence of the stains. Jealousy is about competition for her attention, but this is more about personal boundaries. So, the husband isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary about what's acceptable in their home. The wife's refusal to clean it might be where the problem lies, but the original question is about the husband's wrongness. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's expressing a valid personal boundary. However, it's important for them to communicate and find a compromise, maybe by getting the dress cleaned or storing it elsewhere if that's acceptable.\n"
