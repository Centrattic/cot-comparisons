I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a wife who has a prom dress with cum stains from a past partner, and the husband is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband feels uncomfortable having another man's bodily fluids in his home. That's a valid concern for many people, especially in a committed relationship. On the other hand, the wife has sentimental value attached to the dress and her past experiences. She mentions not wanting to lose those memories and that the husband never cared before, so the sudden issue might feel like jealousy or overreaction.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and communication. The husband's discomfort is about his current feelings towards the presence of another man's cum. Even if he's not jealous of past relationships, the physical presence of that history in their home could be a trigger. However, the wife might see this as an invasion of her personal history or an unnecessary demand. \n\nIs the husband overstepping? Maybe. If he hasn't had an issue before, bringing it up now could be seen as hypocritical. But if he's honest about his current feelings, it's about his comfort in their shared living space. The wife's refusal to clean it might be about maintaining her autonomy and memories, which she's entitled to. \n\nThe question is whether his request is reasonable. Since it's her dress and her memories, unless there's a health concern (like bodily fluids being a biohazard, which cum isn't unless there's an STD), it's more about emotional discomfort. The husband's stance is personal, but the wife has the right to keep her mementos. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? The answer likely hinges on mutual respect. If the husband can express his feelings without controlling her personal items, they might find a compromise. But as presented, the husband is asserting his discomfort, which is valid, while the wife is defending her right to keep the dress. Neither is entirely wrong, but pushing for the dress to be cleaned could be seen as overstepping if there's no health issue. Hence, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because his discomfort is legitimate, but the situation requires negotiation.\n"
