I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see. The situation is about a husband not wanting his wife's prom dress, which has cum stains from a past partner, in their house. He asked her to have it dry-cleaned, but she refuses and says he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I should consider both perspectives. The husband is uncomfortable with another man's bodily fluids in their home. That seems like a reasonable concern. Even if he's not jealous of her past, the presence of someone else's semen might be a hygiene issue for him. On the other hand, the wife has emotional memories tied to the dress and doesn't see why he's upset now if he never cared before. She might feel like he's being possessive or controlling by making her get rid of the dress.\n\nThe key points here are consent, respect, and boundaries. The husband is expressing his discomfort, which is valid. However, if the dress is a significant memory for her and she's not harming anyone by keeping it, maybe he's overstepping by demanding she remove it. But then again, their home is a shared space, and his feelings matter too. \n\nI think it's a matter of communication. If they can't find a compromise, like getting it cleaned (which would resolve the stain issue without erasing memories), then the problem might persist. The husband isn't wrong for feeling that way, but he might need to approach it differently. However, if she's willing to clean it, maybe he's being too rigid. But she's refusing, so he's standing his ground. \n\nI'm leaning towards the husband not being in the wrong because he's expressing his boundaries. But maybe he should have discussed it sooner if he was okay with the dress but the stains bothered him. However, he only brought it up after the friend's visit, which might be a valid trigger. Hmm. It's a bit tricky. But overall, his discomfort is legitimate, so I think he's not wrong.\n"
