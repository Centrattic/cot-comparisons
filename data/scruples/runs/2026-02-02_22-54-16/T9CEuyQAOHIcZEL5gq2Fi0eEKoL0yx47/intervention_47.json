I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a husband who's upset because his wife brought up a prom dress that has stains from another guy's ejaculation. They met in college, so maybe they've been together a while. He says he's not jealous about her past partners, but now he's uncomfortable with the dress in their home. The wife showed the dress to a friend, who noticed the stains, and the friend and wife made a joke about it. Then the author confronts her, asking to have it cleaned, but she refuses, saying it's about her memories and that he's overreacting. Now there's tension because it's still in the closet.\n\nFirst, I should consider the perspectives. The author is saying that while he doesn't care about her past or the act itself, the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home is a problem. The wife is defending her right to keep the dress as a memory from her past. \n\nIs it about boundaries in a relationship? The husband might feel that once they're married, personal items from her past should be kept at a distance. But does he have the authority to demand that? Communication is key here. The wife might feel that her memories are her own and that he's overstepping by asking her to clean it. The husband might feel that their shared living space shouldn't have items from her past that he's uncomfortable with. \n\nBut where's the line? In a relationship, each person has the right to their own memories, but also the responsibility to respect each other's boundaries. If he's not jealous about her past, maybe his issue isn't with her past but with the physical reminder. However, the wife might not see it as a big deal, just a keepsake. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong for making a demand about an item that's her personal property? If she owns the house (or they co-own it), does she have the right to keep it there? Or is the husband within his rights to ask for things that make him uncomfortable to be removed from the shared space? \n\nAlso, the initial reaction was only after the friend's comment and the wife's casual mention of the stains. Before that, he didn't mind. Now he's making a big deal. Could that be overreacting? Or is it a reasonable boundary he's setting now? \n\nAnother angle: the fact that the wife showed the dress to a friend and discussed the stains in his presence might have triggered his discomfort. Maybe he felt it was being flaunted or brought into their shared space unnecessarily. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's possible that the husband is justified in his discomfort. The presence of another man's bodily fluids in the home could be a reasonable concern, even if he's not jealous. However, the wife's right to her memories and personal items is also important. \n\nBut since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I need to see if he violated any norms. If he communicated his discomfort and she refused, but there's no agreement, it's more about differing boundaries. The husband isn't wrong for setting a boundary he's comfortable with. If the wife refuses, it's her choice, but the husband isn't in the wrong for expressing his discomfort. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the husband is being overly controlling by making a demand about her personal item. If they live together, it's a shared space, but she might have the right to keep her things. \n\nIn many relationships, mutual respect and compromise are key. The husband's stance is about his comfort, which is valid. The wife's stance is about her memories. Neither is necessarily wrong, but the husband isn't in the wrong for stating his boundaries. The answer would be B (not in the wrong) because he's expressing his boundaries, even if the wife disagrees.\n"
