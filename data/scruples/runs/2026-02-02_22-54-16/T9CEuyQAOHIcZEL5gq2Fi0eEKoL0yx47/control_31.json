I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong regarding their wife's prom dress with cum stains. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband found out that his wife's prom dress has stains from a previous sexual encounter. He's uncomfortable having it in their home and asked her to get it cleaned. She refuses, saying he's overreacting and that it's part of her memories. Now they're both upset.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent, boundaries, and maybe jealousy. The husband isn't jealous about her past partners, but he's upset about the physical remnants in their home. His main issue is the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their house. From a health or cleanliness perspective, that's a valid concern. Even if he's not jealous, he has a right to his own comfort in their shared living space.\n\nThe wife, on the other hand, values the memories associated with the dress and doesn't want to get rid of them. But does she have the right to ignore her spouse's feelings about it? They live together, so both partners' comfort matters. The husband is asking for a reasonable action (cleaning the dress) to address his discomfort. The wife's response is dismissive, which might be contributing to the tension.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong for wanting the dress cleaned? Well, he's not asking for the dress to be removed entirely, just cleaned. It's a practical request. The wife's refusal is based on her memories, but she's not considering his feelings. However, if the husband had never been an issue before, maybe he's overreacting now. But the situation has caused them both stress, so balance is needed.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The husband expressed his feelings, and the wife didn't take them seriously. That could be her fault. On the other hand, the husband might have handled it differently, maybe discussing it privately without making it about jealousy. But the core issue is about shared space and mutual respect. \n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong for having a boundary he wants respected. The wife's refusal to accommodate that is more about her not respecting his feelings. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
