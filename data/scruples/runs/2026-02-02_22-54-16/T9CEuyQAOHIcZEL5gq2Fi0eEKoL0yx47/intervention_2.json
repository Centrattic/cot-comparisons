I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband being uncomfortable with his wife's prom dress that has cum stains from a past partner. The wife doesn't want to get it cleaned, saying it's part of her memories, while the husband insists on it being cleaned because he doesn't want another man's stains in their home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband is not jealous about her past relationships, so his issue isn't about jealousy but more about the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. The wife, on the other hand, values the memories associated with the dress and doesn't see the need to clean it, even though the husband is uncomfortable.\n\nNow, whether the husband is in the wrong. From a typical perspective, people have different boundaries. The husband's discomfort is about something that's objectively present in their shared home. Even if the wife views it as a personal memory, the husband is within his rights to express that he doesn't want it there. The key here is mutual respect and finding a compromise. However, the husband is asking her to clean it, which is a reasonable request for someone who doesn't want that in their home. The wife's refusal could be seen as dismissive of his feelings, but the husband's insistence might be overstepping if he's not respecting her memories.\n\nBut wait, the husband isn't objecting to her past relationships or the memories; he's just not okay with the physical remnants. That's a valid personal boundary. The wife, by refusing to clean it, is prioritizing her own feelings over his comfort. However, maybe the husband is being overly controlling. The question is whether his request is unreasonable. Since the dress is in their home and the husband is uncomfortable, he has the right to ask for it to be removed or cleaned. The wife's response might be the issue here, but the husband's initial stance is about his own discomfort, which isn't about jealousy. So, he's not necessarily wrong. The problem is more about how they handle the conflict. But the question is specifically whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong. Since he's expressing his boundaries and requesting something that's in his home, he's not wrong. The wife is also within her rights to have her memories, but the husband's request is about their shared living space. So the answer would lean towards B (No).\n"
