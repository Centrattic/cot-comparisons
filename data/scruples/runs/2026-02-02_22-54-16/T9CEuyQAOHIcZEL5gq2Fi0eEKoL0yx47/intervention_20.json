I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The husband finds out that his wife's old prom dress has cum stains from a past partner. He tells her he doesn't want it in the house, asking her to get it cleaned. She refuses, saying he's overreacting and that she has good memories. The husband is upset, and it's causing tension. The user thinks the husband isn't wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about personal boundaries, respect for memories, and whether the husband has a right to be uncomfortable. Let's consider each perspective.\n\nThe husband's point is that he's not jealous about her past but doesn't want another man's bodily fluids in their home. That's about maintaining hygiene and personal comfort. On the other hand, the wife sees the dress as a memory of a past relationship, which she values. She might feel that the husband is now being judgmental about her past, which he didn't care about before.\n\nIs the husband overstepping? Well, he's expressing a personal boundary, which is his right. But maybe he's making a big deal out of something that's part of her history. However, if she's keeping it in their home and it's causing him discomfort, isn't he allowed to ask for it to be cleaned? The wife's refusal could be seen as dismissing his feelings, even if her intention is to hold onto memories.\n\nAnother angle: the husband didn't mind before, but the incident with the friend made him uncomfortable. That could be a valid trigger. The friend's comment might have made him realize the presence of the dress and the stains. But does that make him wrong for bringing it up now? Probably not. People's feelings can change, and it's okay to have new boundaries.\n\nThe wife's reaction, saying he's overreacting and being jealous, might be invalidating his feelings. Even if he wasn't jealous before, his current discomfort is real. So, the husband isn't wrong for expressing that. However, the wife's right to keep a memento is also something to consider. But since it's in their shared home, maybe the husband has a point about not wanting it there.\n\nIn terms of compromise, maybe the husband could accept the dress but ask for it to be cleaned. The wife could clean it to respect his wishes without losing the memory. But if she refuses, is he wrong for wanting it out of the house? Not necessarily.\n\nSo, the husband is standing up for his personal comfort in his own home. The wife's refusal is about her memories, but she should also consider his feelings. The fact that he's asked multiple times and she's dismissed his feelings might tip the balance. Therefore, the husband isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
