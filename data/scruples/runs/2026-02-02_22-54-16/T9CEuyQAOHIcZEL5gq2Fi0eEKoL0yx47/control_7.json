I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a wife's prom dress that has another guy's cum stains, and the husband is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The husband didn't mind his wife's past partners before, but this specific incident made him uncomfortable. The wife found the situation funny and didn't want to clean the dress, valuing the memories. The husband wants it cleaned because he doesn't want another man's bodily fluids in their home.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationships, jealousy is a common issue. The husband's reaction could be seen as a boundary about what he's comfortable with in their shared living space. However, the wife argues that the dress is part of her memories and she doesn't want to erase that. \n\nIs the husband overreacting? Maybe. Some might say that unless the stains pose a health risk, it's just a personal memory. But others might agree that once married, the husband has a right to set boundaries about what's kept in the household. \n\nThe wife's behavior of displaying the dress and making a joke about it might be contributing to the tension. The husband's request for cleaning isn't about the sex itself but the physical presence of another man in their home. \n\nSo, who's in the wrong? It's a bit subjective. Legally, there's no issue. Emotionally, it's about mutual respect. The husband is setting a boundary, which is his right. The wife is also entitled to her memories. But if the husband is uncomfortable, the wife not respecting that boundary could be problematic. However, the husband's reaction might be seen as controlling if the dress doesn't affect him physically. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the husband isn't jealous of her past but the physical reminder is an issue, it's a personal choice. But if the wife refuses to clean it despite his discomfort, maybe she's not respecting his feelings. However, the husband's insistence might be overstepping, as it's her personal item. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the husband's demand is reasonable. Since the stains aren't causing harm, and it's her memory, the husband might be in the wrong for overreacting. But others might side with him on the cleanliness and personal boundaries. \n\nThe possible answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's expressing his comfort level, but others might say A. But I need to decide based on common perspectives.\n"
