I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe author is a 41-year-old man married to his college sweetheart. He didn't mind his wife's past partners until this specific incident. His wife had a prom dress that's been in her closet for a long time. When a friend came over, the wife showed her the dress, and it had spots which she admitted were from her ex's mess. The friend made an \"ew\" comment, and then later, the wife showed the dress to the author, making a comment about getting dirty in the limo. The author then expressed discomfort about the other guy's cum stains and told her to get it dry cleaned. She responded that he was overreacting and she didn't want to clean it because it's a memory. Now there's tension between them.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author is not in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The author says he's not jealous of her past partners before this. The issue here is about the physical presence of another person's bodily fluids in their home. The wife is holding onto the dress for sentimental reasons, while the author is upset about it. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's uncomfortable with having someone else's bodily fluids in their home. That's a health and personal boundary issue for him. He's not upset about her past relationships per se, but the physical residue. On the other hand, the wife sees the dress as a memory and is upset that he wants it cleaned, interpreting it as jealousy. \n\nI think the key points here are about personal boundaries and communication. The author is expressing his discomfort, which is valid if he finds it offensive or a health concern. The wife is valuing her sentimental attachment. Both have valid points but need to communicate better. \n\nIs the author overreacting? Maybe. But if he's not comfortable with it, he has a right to express that. However, the way he brought it up might have been abrupt, especially after the wife showed it to him with a teasing comment. The wife's reaction might stem from feeling he's being jealous, which he says he's not. So there's a communication breakdown. \n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, I think it's more about differing perspectives. He's not wrong for expressing his discomfort, but perhaps could have approached it differently. However, the question is if he is in the wrong for not wanting the dress in the house. Since he's the one living in the house and has the right to his boundaries, I'd lean towards B (no), he's not in the wrong. The wife's refusal to clean it despite his request is also a problem, but the initial request itself isn't wrong.\n"
