I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong regarding the prom dress with cum stains. So, the husband found out that his wife's prom dress has stains from another guy's cum and he wants it cleaned. She's not willing to clean it and is upset that he's bringing it up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband isn't jealous about her past partners in general, but this specific situation is about a physical item in their home that has bodily fluids from someone else. He's asking her to clean it, which is a reasonable request. The wife, on the other hand, is defending her right to keep the dress as a memory, even though the husband is uncomfortable with it.\n\nFrom a standpoint of respect in a marriage, both partners should consider each other's feelings. The husband's discomfort is valid. He might feel that having another man's bodily fluids in their home is unhygienic or makes him uneasy. It's a personal boundary he's trying to enforce. The wife's argument is about her memories and not being jealous, but she's not respecting his boundaries by refusing to clean it. \n\nAlso, the fact that she showed the dress to a friend and made a joke about it in front of him might have escalated the situation. The husband's reaction seems to be more about hygiene and the presence of another person's bodily fluids rather than jealousy about her past. \n\nSo, the key here is mutual respect. The husband has a right to ask for the dress to be cleaned if it's causing him discomfort. The wife, while having her own memories, needs to consider her husband's feelings. If she insists on keeping the dress without cleaning it, she's not respecting his boundaries. Therefore, the husband isn't in the wrong for wanting the dress cleaned. The wife is in the wrong for not respecting his request and continuing to keep it. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's another angle. Some people might view the husband's reaction as overstepping because it's a memory item. But the presence of bodily fluids is a health and cleanliness issue. So, it's a balance between respecting personal history and maintaining a healthy home environment. In that case, the husband's request is reasonable. The wife's refusal without cleaning it might be the issue here. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
