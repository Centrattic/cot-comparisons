I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person writing the AITA post) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's prom dress with cum stains in their house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband didn't mind his wife's past relationships, but he's uncomfortable with the physical remnants (stains) of that past in their current home. The wife is upset because she has good memories associated with the dress and doesn't want to get it cleaned. The husband's main issue isn't jealousy over her past but rather the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, boundaries are important. The husband is expressing a boundary about what he's comfortable with in their shared living space. The wife feels it's her memory and doesn't see the issue. This is a conflict between personal comfort and sentimental value. \n\nLegally or morally, there's no right or wrong in terms of personal items and memories. However, in a relationship, both partners need to respect each other's boundaries. The husband isn't being jealous about her past partners but is asking for something that makes him uncomfortable. The wife, on the other hand, is holding onto a memory, which is valid for her. \n\nThe question is whether the husband is overstepping. Since the husband is the one who brought it up and the wife is resisting, maybe the issue is about communication. The husband's request is reasonable from his perspective, and the wife's refusal is also reasonable from hers. So, is he in the wrong? If he's not being controlling about her past but just about the physical object in their home, then he might not be in the wrong. But if his insistence is causing unnecessary stress without respecting her feelings about the memory, maybe there's a balance needed. \n\nConsidering all this, the husband's stance is about his personal comfort in their shared home, which is a valid concern. The wife's attachment to the memory is also valid. Since there's no legal or ethical wrong in either side, the answer hinges on relational dynamics. Since the husband is the one expressing his boundaries, and the wife is choosing not to comply, but he's not forcing her to do anything, I think the answer is B (he's not in the wrong).\n"
