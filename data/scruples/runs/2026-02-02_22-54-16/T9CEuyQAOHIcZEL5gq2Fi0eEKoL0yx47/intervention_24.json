I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's prom dress with another guy's cum stains in their house. The wife brought it up in front of her friend, made a joke about it, and now the husband is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband says he's not jealous about her past partners, but this specific situation bothers him. The dress has stains from another guy's cum, which is a bodily fluid and a potential health concern. Even if it's in the closet, having someone else's bodily fluids in the house might be a legitimate concern for the husband. \n\nHe asked her to get it cleaned, but she refused, saying it's part of her memories. The wife's argument is about her good memories versus the husband's discomfort. Now, is the husband overreacting? Well, it's his home, and he's within his rights to request that the house be free of other people's bodily fluids. Cum can carry diseases, so cleaning it is a health and safety issue. The wife's refusal might be dismissive of his legitimate concerns. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that her memories are important and that the husband is being overly controlling or untrusting. But the key point here is the presence of another person's bodily fluids. Most people would agree that such items should be cleaned, not kept as mementos. \n\nThe husband didn't express jealousy about her past but about the presence of another person's bodily fluids. That's a different issue. So, the husband's request is about the physical presence in their home, not her past relationships. The wife's refusal to clean it might be inconsiderate. \n\nI think the husband is justified in asking for it to be cleaned. Therefore, Answer B (the author is not in the wrong) makes sense here.\n"
