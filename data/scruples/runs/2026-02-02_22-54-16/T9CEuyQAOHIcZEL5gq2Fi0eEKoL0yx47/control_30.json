I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the husband found out his wife's prom dress has cum stains from a past partner. He's uncomfortable with it and wants it cleaned, but she's refusing, saying he's overreacting. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband isn't jealous about her past relationships in general, so it's not about her having had sex before. The issue is specifically about the physical presence of another man's cum in their home. That's a new concern for him. On the other hand, the wife values the dress as a memory and doesn't want to get rid of that part of her past.\n\nSo, the question is whether the husband is justified in wanting the dress cleaned. From a health perspective, bodily fluids can carry pathogens, so cleaning it makes sense. But maybe the husband is more bothered by the symbolic aspect\u2014like it's a reminder of her past relationship. The wife, however, sees it as a personal memory and doesn't want to erase it.\n\nThe wife's friend mentioned the stains, and the wife didn't hide it, even laughed about it in front of the husband. That might have triggered the husband's discomfort. Now he's bringing it up, but she's resisting. \n\nIs it the husband's place to dictate what his wife keeps in her closet, especially if it's her personal item? Maybe he's overstepping by making her clean it. But then again, if he's uncomfortable living in a space with someone else's bodily fluids, that's valid. \n\nI need to check if there's any cultural or social norms here. In some contexts, keeping such items might be seen as keeping the past alive, but others might find it unhygienic. Also, since they're married and have been together for a long time, maybe the husband's sudden objection is about his own feelings rather than an actual health issue. \n\nThe wife's argument is that the husband is being jealous, but he says he's not. The key here is whether the husband's request is reasonable. If it's a health and safety issue, then he's justified. If it's about personal discomfort with the symbolic presence, that's more about his feelings, which should be respected, but the wife's right to keep her memories is also valid. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the issue is about actual health risks or just personal discomfort. If it's the latter, the husband is overreacting. If it's the former, he's justified. The description says the husband doesn't care that she had sex but doesn't want the stains. That seems more about personal comfort than health. Therefore, maybe the husband is overstepping, making him in the wrong. But if the presence of bodily fluids is a health issue, then it's about hygiene. However, prom dresses aren't typically dry-cleaned for every use, so maybe the stains are old and not a health risk anymore. \n\nIn the end, the wife's right to keep her personal belongings and memories might outweigh the husband's discomfort, unless there's a genuine health concern. Since the husband doesn't mention health but rather personal discomfort, he might be in the wrong for pressuring her to clean it. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) if the husband's stance is about personal comfort. Wait, but the answer options are A for Yes (author wrong) and B for No. If the husband is not in the wrong, then answer is B. If the husband is in the wrong, answer A. The question is, is the author (the husband) wrong? If he's justified, answer is B. If he's wrong, answer A. \n\nSince the husband is expressing discomfort with another's bodily fluids in their home, which is a reasonable concern, even if it's a memory. So maybe he's not wrong. But the wife has the right to her memories. It's a bit of a toss-up. But in terms of personal property and privacy, the wife's decision to keep the dress as is might be respected, making the husband overstepping if he insists. Therefore, answer A (author is in the wrong). But maybe the husband is justified in wanting a clean home. Hmm. I'm a bit conflicted. The key point is that the husband's objection is about the physical presence of another's bodily fluid, which is a health concern. So if that's the case, he's not wrong. But if it's symbolic, he is. The line is blurry here. The answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) if the husband's request is about hygiene. But if it's about jealousy or discomfort, then A. The story says he's not jealous, but the wife says he's overreacting. Since the husband's stance is about the cum stains, not the relationship, maybe he's justified in wanting it cleaned. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong (B). But the wife's right to her memories is also a factor. It's a tough call. Maybe the answer is B because the husband's request is reasonable for a clean home, and the wife's refusal is about her personal choice. So the author is not in the wrong.\n"
