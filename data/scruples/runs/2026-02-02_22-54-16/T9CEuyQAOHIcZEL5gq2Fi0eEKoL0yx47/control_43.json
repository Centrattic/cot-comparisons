I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the husband finds out his wife's old prom dress has cum stains from a previous partner. He's uncomfortable having it in the house and asks her to get it cleaned, but she refuses, saying it's part of her memories and he's being jealous.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's main issue is not about her past relationships but the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. He's not jealous about her past, as he stated. The wife, on the other hand, values the dress for its sentimental reasons and sees the husband's request as overstepping.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. In relationships, it's common for partners to have boundaries about certain things. The husband is expressing a personal boundary about having another person's bodily fluids in their shared space. But does that make him wrong? Well, he's not upset about her past, so it's more about hygiene and comfort in their home. However, the wife has a right to her memories and might feel that her privacy or personal items are being invaded.\n\nBut then again, the house is a shared space, and both should have mutual agreement on what's acceptable. If the husband is genuinely uncomfortable, isn't it reasonable for him to express that? The wife's refusal might be seen as dismissive of his feelings. However, she might feel he's being possessive or controlling by asking her to remove or clean a personal item she owns.\n\nLooking at societal norms, some people might say that once the relationship is past, the husband has no claim over her personal items or memories. Others might argue that in a current relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries, even regarding past items. The key here is whether the husband's request is reasonable. Since he's not asking her to erase her past but to clean the item for hygiene reasons in their shared home, that seems reasonable.\n\nBut the wife is holding onto it for sentimental reasons. It's a conflict between personal comfort and hygiene versus sentimental value. In such cases, communication is key. The husband tried to express his discomfort, and the wife dismissed it as jealousy. If the husband is not being controlling but is just asking for a clean home, then maybe he's not in the wrong. On the flip side, if the wife feels her memories are being invalidated, that's a valid emotional reaction too.\n\nI think the husband is within his rights to ask for the dress to be cleaned if it's in their shared home. The fact that he's not upset about her past relationships but the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids is a valid concern for some people. The wife's refusal without addressing his feelings could be seen as dismissive. However, the husband might not have considered the sentimental value, but he did mention he wasn't jealous, so maybe he's just focusing on the physical aspect. It's a tricky situation where both have valid points. But since the husband is expressing a legitimate discomfort in their shared living space, I might lean towards him not being in the wrong.\n"
