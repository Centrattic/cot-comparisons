I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a wife's prom dress that has cum stains from a past partner. The husband is upset about it and wants it cleaned or removed, but the wife is holding onto it for sentimental reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key elements here. The husband isn't jealous of her past, but the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home is causing him discomfort. The wife is defensive, saying it's part of her memories and that the husband is overreacting. \n\nI should consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together since college, so they've likely known each other for a long time. The husband's main issue isn't her past but the current presence of the stains. The wife is okay with keeping the dress, which is in their home, and she's not removing it despite the husband's requests.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. The answer depends on various factors. The husband has a valid concern about bodily fluids in the home, which might be a health or personal hygiene issue. However, the wife has a right to her memories. But since it's their shared home, both should have a say in what's kept there. The husband's request is about cleaning the dress, which is a reasonable compromise. The wife's refusal to clean it might be seen as dismissive of his feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that her memories are important, and the husband is overstepping by making her clean it. But the husband isn't asking her to get rid of the dress, just to clean it. The wife's reaction could be seen as being defensive and not considering his comfort. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is key. If the husband is uncomfortable, the wife should at least discuss it and find a solution, like cleaning it. The fact that she's not willing to do that might mean she's not respecting his feelings. Therefore, the husband's stance is about his personal boundaries, and the wife isn't respecting that. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
