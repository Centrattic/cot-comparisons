I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before!

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author and his wife are married, and they met in college. The wife had a prom dress that she kept in her closet for years. The author didn't mind it until a friend came over and they discussed the dress. The wife showed it to her friend, and the friend noticed spots. The wife mentioned that her date was a mess and that she should have taken off before they had sex. The friend made an \"ew\" comment. Later, the wife told the author that she wished they could have gone to prom together and \"gotten dirty in the limo.\" The author then expressed discomfort about another man's cum stains in the house and asked her to get it dry-cleaned. The wife was surprised and said she didn't want to clean it, asking the author not to be jealous. The author said he's not jealous about her past partners but doesn't want the stains in the house. The wife says he's overreacting, and the situation is awkward now.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to think about the key points here. The author is upset about the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. The wife is holding onto the dress because of the memories and doesn't want to clean it. The author claims not to be jealous about her past but is concerned about the physical presence of the stains. The wife is defensive, saying he's overreacting and that he's jealous.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, people might have different boundaries regarding their partner's past. Some might find it uncomfortable to have a partner's ex's bodily fluids in the house, even if they aren't jealous of the ex relationship itself. Others might see the dress as a sentimental item and not see the issue. The wife's argument is about her right to keep the dress and the memories, while the author is focused on the physical aspect and comfort in their home.\n\nLegally, there's no law against keeping a prom dress with stains, so that's not a factor here. The issue is more about personal boundaries and mutual respect. The author is expressing a discomfort that is valid for him, but the wife is also within her rights to have her own feelings about the dress. However, in a marriage, both partners need to consider each other's feelings. The author's request is about removing something that makes him uncomfortable, which is reasonable. The wife's refusal might be seen as dismissive of his feelings, even if she has her own reasons for keeping the dress.\n\nBut wait, the author says he isn't jealous of her past partners, so maybe his issue isn't with the relationship itself but with the physical residue. That's a bit different. If he's not jealous about the sexual history but is bothered by the presence of another man's bodily fluids, is that a valid concern? It could be. Some people might have a phobia or disgust response to that, while others don't. So his reaction isn't necessarily irrational.\n\nHowever, the wife might see this as an overreaction because the dress is a memory from her past. She's not engaging in any current behavior that affects their relationship, just keeping an item from her past. The author's request to have it cleaned is a way to set a boundary. The wife is refusing, which could lead to ongoing tension.\n\nIn terms of social norms, some people might say that once the dress is in the home, the owner has the right to keep it, especially if it's non-offensive to others. Others might argue that the husband has a right to feel comfortable in his own home and that respecting each other's boundaries is key. \n\nThe wife's comment about the husband being jealous suggests that she perceives his request as coming from a place of insecurity rather than a genuine discomfort. The husband clarifies that he's not jealous, just uncomfortable with the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids. That's a subtle but important distinction. If the husband is honest about his feelings, then it's about personal boundaries rather than jealousy.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's being honest about his discomfort and is making a reasonable request (dry cleaning the dress), and the wife is refusing to consider his feelings, then maybe both are at fault. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the husband is just expressing a boundary and the wife is not respecting it, then the husband isn't in the wrong. However, if the husband's request is excessive or controlling, then he might be in the wrong. \n\nIn this case, the husband is asking for the dress to be cleaned because of the stains. Dry cleaning might not remove the stains, but it's a request to have it done. The wife is being dismissive and not considering his feelings. The husband's stance is about his comfort in their home, which is a valid concern. Therefore, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong. The wife's refusal to address his concern, despite knowing it's a source of discomfort, might be the bigger issue. \n\nBut wait, the dress is a part of her past. She might see it as important to her. However, in a shared home, both partners' comfort should be considered. The husband has a right to ask for changes that affect his well-being. So, the author (husband) isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
