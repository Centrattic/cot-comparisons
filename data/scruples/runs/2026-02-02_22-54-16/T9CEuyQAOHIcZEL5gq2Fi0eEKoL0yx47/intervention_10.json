I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a wife who has a prom dress with stains from her ex's cum, and her husband is upset about it. The husband wants the dress cleaned or removed from the house, while the wife thinks he's being jealous and refuses to clean it. The user thinks the author is not wrong, but wants to know my opinion, choosing between A (in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the husband's perspective. He's not jealous of her past partners, but he's uncomfortable with the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. That seems like a valid concern. Even if it's not about jealousy, it's about hygiene and personal boundaries. The wife is keeping the dress as a memory, which she values emotionally, but the husband's comfort is also important in a relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's argument is that it's her memory and he shouldn't be jealous. She might feel that the husband is overreacting because he's not bothered by her past, but the physical object is a trigger. However, the husband's request is about the stain itself, not her relationships. He's not saying he's jealous, but he doesn't want someone else's bodily fluids in their home.\n\nI should also think about consent and shared spaces. They live together, so both should have some say in what's in the house. If she's keeping a personal item that the other person finds uncomfortable, there's a need for compromise. The husband is asking for a reasonable action (cleaning) to remove the stains, which is a practical solution. The wife's refusal might be seen as clinging to the memory, but the husband's discomfort is real.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The husband brought it up after the friend's visit, which is when he became aware of the issue. He's tried discussing it again later, but she's dismissive. The wife's response of \"don't be jealous\" might be invalidating his feelings. If the husband is genuinely uncomfortable, the wife's refusal could be seen as not respecting his feelings, even if she has her own emotional ties.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to respect each other's boundaries. The husband's boundary is about not wanting another person's bodily fluids in their home. The wife's boundary is about keeping a personal memory. The question is which boundary takes precedence. Since the husband is the one living with the wife, and the dress is in their shared home, his request for cleaning seems reasonable. The wife's refusal without considering his feelings might be where the issue lies.\n\nBut maybe the wife sees the dress as a non-issue because it's just a memory, and the husband is overreacting. However, if he's not jealous but just wants the stains gone, that's a practical concern. The answer might depend on whether the husband's request is reasonable. Cleaning the dress to remove the stains isn't about destroying the memory but about hygiene and comfort. The wife might be in the wrong for not respecting that.\n\nSo, considering all that, the husband is not in the wrong for wanting the stains cleaned. He's not making a jealousy issue but a practical one. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no other perspective I'm missing. Maybe some would argue that the wife's emotional attachment is valid and the husband should accept it. However, in shared living spaces, mutual respect for each other's comfort is key. The husband's request is reasonable here.\n"
