I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's prom dress, which has cum stains from a past partner, in their house. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife has had the dress in her closet for a long time, and the husband didn't have an issue with it until a friend visited and they discussed it. The wife's friend noticed stains, and the wife made a joke about her date being a mess. After the friend left, the wife showed off the dress again, mentioning having \"got dirty in the limo,\" which prompted the husband to ask her to have it dry-cleaned. The wife refused, saying he was overreacting and that she has good memories of that night.\n\nSo, the husband's main issue isn't the past sex with other partners but specifically the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. He's not jealous about her past relationships but is uncomfortable with the physical remnants. The wife, on the other hand, values the memories associated with the dress and doesn't want to clean it, seeing it as part of her history.\n\nNow, to determine if the husband is in the wrong. Legally, the dress is her property, and he can't force her to get rid of it unless they have a specific agreement. Emotionally, this is about personal boundaries and comfort. The husband is expressing a discomfort that isn't about jealousy but about the physical presence of another person's bodily fluids. That's a valid concern for many people, even if others might find it trivial.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that her memories are important and that her husband is being overly sensitive. The key here is mutual respect for each other's feelings. If the husband's discomfort is causing tension, it's a matter of communication and compromise. However, the husband isn't violating any rules by expressing his boundaries. He's not trying to control her past but is asserting his own comfort in their shared living space.\n\nSo, considering that, the husband isn't in the wrong for stating his preference. He's asking her to consider their shared space and his feelings. The wife's refusal is her right, but the husband's request isn't unreasonable. It's more about differing values and how each person prioritizes their own comfort versus their partner's history.\n"
