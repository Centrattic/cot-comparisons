I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband being upset about his wife's prom dress that has stains from another guy's semen. They've been married for a long time, and he's not typically jealous, but this specific issue is causing tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband didn't mind his wife's past relationships and had never noticed the dress before. The issue arose when his wife casually mentioned the stains and seemed to enjoy the memory. The husband's main concern isn't the sex itself but the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. \n\nMarital boundaries and personal comfort play a role here. Even if the husband isn't jealous about past partners, the physical remnants might be a new issue. The wife, on the other hand, values her memories and doesn't see the problem. The key question is whether the husband's request is reasonable.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The husband expressed his discomfort, and the wife dismissed it as jealousy. However, his reasoning isn't about jealousy but about not wanting someone else's bodily fluids in their home. That's a valid health and personal space concern. The wife's refusal to clean it despite the husband's request might be seen as disregarding his feelings.\n\nBut is the husband overreacting? Some might argue that it's a small issue to fix, while others might see it as a legitimate boundary. The fact that the husband had never cared before and only did after the conversation with the friend suggests it's a new sensitivity, possibly triggered by the specific context of the memory. However, maintaining a clean home is reasonable, and bodily fluids can carry health risks, adding another layer to the concern.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the husband isn't wrong to express his discomfort, especially if it affects his well-being. The wife is also within her rights to cherish her memories. The problem is the clash of values. The husband's request is about his comfort and health, while the wife values her past. Since the husband isn't being jealous but is instead concerned about the physical presence of another's bodily fluids, he's not necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because his issue isn't about jealousy but about personal boundaries and health. The wife's refusal to accommodate his request, while her own memories are valid, might be where the tension lies. So the husband's stance is reasonable, making him not in the wrong.\n"
