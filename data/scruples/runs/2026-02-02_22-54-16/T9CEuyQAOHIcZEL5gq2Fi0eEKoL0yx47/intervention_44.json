I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a wife's prom dress that has cum stains from a past partner. The husband is uncomfortable having it in the house, but the wife doesn't want to get it cleaned, saying it's part of her memories.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's main issue isn't about jealousy over her past, as he mentions he's not jealous. His problem is the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. That's a health and hygiene concern. On the other hand, the wife is holding onto a sentimental item from her past, which she feels is important to her memories.\n\nIn relationships, boundaries are important. The husband is setting a boundary about what he's comfortable with regarding cleanliness. The wife, however, might see the dress as a personal memento and not a problem. The key here is whether the husband's request is reasonable. Since he's not being jealous but rather concerned about health, it's more about his comfort and the home environment.\n\nThe wife's response of \"don't be jealous\" might be dismissive of his legitimate concern. If the husband is uncomfortable, it's valid for him to ask her to clean it. The wife's refusal could be seen as not respecting his boundary. However, the husband's approach might come off as overreacting if the wife doesn't share the same perspective. But given that he's not being controlling and just wants it cleaned for health reasons, it's a reasonable request.\n\nSo, the husband isn't in the wrong. He's expressing a valid concern about the home environment. The wife's refusal might be where the issue lies, not the husband's initial request. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
