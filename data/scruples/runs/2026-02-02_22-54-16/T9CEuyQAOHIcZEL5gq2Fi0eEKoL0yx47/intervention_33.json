I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's prom dress with another man's cum stains in their house. \n\nFirst, the context: The wife had the dress for a long time, and the author never had an issue before. The problem arose when the wife mentioned the stains and laughed about it in front of him. The author then expressed discomfort about the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. The wife feels it's a personal memory and refuses to clean it, leading to tension.\n\nFrom a personal perspective, the author's discomfort seems valid. Even though he's not jealous of her past, the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home is a hygiene and personal boundary issue. The wife's refusal to clean it might be seen as disregarding her partner's feelings, especially since he's clearly stated his discomfort. \n\nHowever, the wife's stance is that it's a cherished memory. But memories shouldn't override the partner's health and comfort. The key here is mutual respect for each other's boundaries. The author is asking the wife to remove something that makes him uncomfortable, which is reasonable. \n\nThe wife's reaction of calling him overreacting and being jealous might indicate she's not respecting his feelings. The author isn't wrong for wanting to maintain a clean home environment. So, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B). But I need to make sure there's no other angle. Maybe some might argue about personal memories vs. partner's comfort. But generally, respecting each other's comfort zones is crucial in a relationship. So, sticking with B.\n"
