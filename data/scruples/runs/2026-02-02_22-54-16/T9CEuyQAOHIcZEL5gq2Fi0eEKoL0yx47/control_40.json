I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a wife who has a prom dress with stains from a past sexual encounter. The husband is upset about the presence of another man's semen in their home and wants it cleaned. The wife is against it, saying it's a memory and that the husband is overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband isn't jealous about her past partners in general but is specifically bothered by the physical remnants in their home. He's not upset about the act itself but the presence of bodily fluids. The wife, on the other hand, sees the dress as part of her memories and is resistant to getting it cleaned. She even makes a comment about the husband not being there for the prom, which adds a layer of emotional complexity.\n\nMarital boundaries are a big factor here. In a committed relationship, some might argue that the husband has a right to expect that such items are not present in the shared living space. However, others might say that the wife's past is her own, and as long as there's no deceit, the husband overreacting. Jealousy isn't always about the act but about the feelings of insecurity or discomfort.\n\nBut wait, the key point is whether the husband is in the wrong. The wife's actions weren't harmful; she had the dress in her closet for a long time before this incident. The husband's issue arose after hearing about the stains from her friend. The wife's disclosure might have been casual, which upset him. Now he's trying to enforce a boundary. The question is whether his reaction is reasonable.\n\nLegally, there's no law against keeping a used prom dress. Emotionally, it's about mutual respect. The husband's discomfort is valid, but the wife's right to her memories is also valid. If the wife was aware of the stains and didn't mention them, perhaps she should have. But since the husband never asked about it before, he might not be in the wrong for objecting now. However, the wife's continued refusal to clean it might be where the issue lies. \n\nBut the husband is the one who brought up the issue, so if he's the one causing tension by not respecting her memories, he might be the one at fault. Alternatively, if he's the one who now has a problem with the item in their home, he's within his rights to ask for it to be cleaned, especially if it's a shared space. \n\nThe answer could go either way. If the husband is overstepping by dictating how she handles her memories, then he's wrong. But if he's within his rights to expect cleanliness in their shared home, then he's not wrong. The line is blurry here. Since the wife's actions were not deceitful and the husband's issue is about cleanliness and not the past relationship itself, maybe he's overreacting. But it's a personal boundary issue. Since the wife didn't hide the dress before, maybe the husband is in the wrong for bringing it up now.\n"
