I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves a wife's prom dress that has cum stains from a past partner. The husband is upset about it and wants it cleaned, while the wife thinks he's overreacting and doesn't want to clean it because of her memories.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The husband says he's not jealous of her past, but this specific issue is making him uncomfortable. The wife is defending her right to keep the dress as a memory. \n\nFrom the husband's perspective, he might feel that having another man's bodily fluids in their home is unhygienic or emotionally unsettling. Even if he isn't jealous, the presence of the stains might trigger discomfort or a sense of intrusion. On the other hand, the wife values the memories associated with the dress and sees it as part of her history. \n\nI should also think about boundaries in relationships. It's possible that the husband's feelings are valid, even if they weren't discussed before. However, the wife might feel that her autonomy over personal items is being challenged. \n\nAnother angle is communication. The husband brought it up after the incident, and the wife felt he was overreacting. They haven't resolved it yet. Maybe the issue is more about differing priorities\u2014his clean house versus her sentimental attachment. \n\nLegally, there's no issue, but emotionally, it's a matter of mutual respect. The husband isn't in the wrong if he's being honest about his feelings. The wife is also not in the wrong for valuing her memories. However, the husband's request might be reasonable if he's uncomfortable. But since it's her dress, maybe she has the right to decide its fate. \n\nWait, but the key here is whether the husband is in the wrong for his stance. If the husband is respecting her past but just doesn't want the stains in their home, that's understandable. However, if he's being controlling or not respecting her feelings, then maybe he's in the wrong. \n\nThe wife's friend found the stains gross, so maybe the husband isn't alone in that. But the wife is choosing not to clean it, which shows her preference. The husband's issue is more about the physical presence of the stains, not her past. So maybe he's not in the wrong for expressing his discomfort, but he might need to approach it differently. \n\nIn terms of relationship advice, open communication is key. Both sides have valid points. The husband isn't wrong for wanting it cleaned, but the wife isn't wrong for not wanting to. The answer might depend on who is more in the wrong. Since the husband's main issue isn't jealousy but the stains themselves, he's not necessarily wrong. However, if the wife is being dismissive, maybe he's justified. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because his discomfort is valid, and he's expressing his feelings. The wife's refusal is about her memories, but the husband's request is about his living environment. Unless there's a violation of mutual agreements, he isn't wrong for wanting it cleaned.\n"
