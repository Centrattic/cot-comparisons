I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a wife's prom dress that has cum stains from a past partner, and the husband's discomfort about keeping it in their home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband is upset because he doesn't want another man's bodily fluids in their house, even though he's not jealous of his wife's past. The wife, on the other hand, values the memories associated with the dress and refuses to clean it, arguing that the husband is overreacting. \n\nFrom the husband's standpoint, his reaction seems to be about personal boundaries and maintaining a clean household. It's not about jealousy but about what he finds acceptable in their shared living space. He's not contesting her past but the physical presence of something he finds unpleasant. \n\nThe wife's perspective is about her emotional attachment to the item. She views the dress as a memory from a significant time in her life and doesn't see the need to remove it. Her friend's reaction (the \"ew\" comment) might have been a joke, but the wife doesn't seem to mind the stain herself. \n\nNow, considering social norms and relationships, it's common for people to have differing boundaries. The husband's discomfort is understandable, but is it valid? In many cultures, bodily fluids are considered unhygienic, so his request for the dress to be cleaned could be seen as reasonable. However, the wife's right to keep personal items and memories in her own home is also valid. \n\nThe key point here is whether the husband's request is overstepping. He's not asking her to erase the memory, just to clean the dress. But if she refuses, he's in a position where he has to accept that her memories conflict with his comfort. The question is whether his stance is wrong. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, communication is key. The husband expressed his feelings, and the wife dismissed them as jealousy. The problem might be that she's not respecting his feelings, thinking he's overreacting. However, if the husband is calm and not pressuring her to discard the dress, just wanting it cleaned for hygiene reasons, then he's within his rights. \n\nThe wife might be in the right to keep her personal memories, but the husband's request for cleanliness is also reasonable. The answer might depend on cultural or personal views on bodily fluids. However, since the husband isn't asking her to throw it away but to clean it, which is a standard expectation, he might not be in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all aspects, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong) because his request is about hygiene and personal comfort, not jealousy, and it's reasonable to ask for something in your home to be clean. The wife's refusal is about her memories, but the husband isn't wrong for expressing his discomfort.\n"
