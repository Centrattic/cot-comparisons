I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's prom dress with another man's cum stains in their house. The wife has had the dress in her closet for a long time, and the author never had an issue until the friend's comment revealed the stains. The author then asks her to get it cleaned, but she refuses, saying he's overreacting and not jealous.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. He's uncomfortable with the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. That's a valid feeling; people have different boundaries and comfort levels. Even though he's not jealous of her past partners, the physical presence of that memory in their home might be a new boundary he's setting now. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife has had this dress for years and associates it with good memories. She's defending her right to keep it, possibly seeing it as a personal memento. Her reaction of \"don't be jealous\" might be dismissive of his feelings, even if he's not actually jealous. That could be where the conflict arises. She's not respecting his new boundary, which he's clearly communicated. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and communication. The author expressed his discomfort, and the wife didn't take it seriously, which is causing tension. While the author's stance is about his own comfort, the wife's refusal to comply without understanding his perspective might make her the one in the wrong. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. \n\nSince the author is asserting his own boundaries in their shared home, and the wife is dismissing his feelings as jealousy when he's not actually feeling that, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. However, it's also about how they're handling the situation. The author could have approached it differently, maybe discussing the emotional impact rather than focusing on the physical stains. But the core issue is about personal boundaries. The author has the right to ask for the dress to be cleaned if it's making him uncomfortable, regardless of the past. The wife's refusal might be where the problem lies, but the author's initial stance isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
