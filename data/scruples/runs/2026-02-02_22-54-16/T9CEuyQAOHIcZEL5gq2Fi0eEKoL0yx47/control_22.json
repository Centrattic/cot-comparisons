I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the wife has a prom dress with cum stains from a past partner, and the husband doesn't want that in their house. He asked her to get it cleaned, but she refuses, saying it's her memory and not to be jealous. The question is whether the husband is in the wrong for not wanting the other guy's semen in their home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's main point is about the physical presence of someone else's bodily fluids in their shared living space. He's not necessarily jealous about her past relationships, as he mentions he doesn't care that she had sex with other people. The issue is the actual stains, which could be unsanitary or make him uncomfortable. On the other hand, the wife has emotional memories tied to that dress and doesn't want to get rid of them. She might see it as an invasion of her personal history for her to keep it as is.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the husband is wrong. From a personal boundaries perspective, maybe the husband is within his rights to express discomfort about bodily fluids in the house. However, the wife's right to her own memories and past experiences is also valid. The key point here is that the husband isn't objecting to her past relationships but specifically the physical remnants. That might be a reasonable boundary. On the other hand, the wife's refusal to clean it could be seen as dismissive of his feelings. \n\nI should also consider cultural or social norms. Some people might find it reasonable to want to clean up such stains, while others might view it as overreacting. The wife's friend's reaction (\"ew\") might indicate that even others find the stains unpleasant, which could support the husband's stance. However, the wife's emotional attachment complicates things. \n\nAnother angle is communication. The husband has talked to her about it, and she's not budging. If he's made his feelings known and she still refuses, it's a matter of whose feelings are more important here. The husband's discomfort versus her emotional connection to the dress. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's hard to say there's a clear answer. But if we have to pick A or B, maybe the husband isn't wrong because he's setting a boundary about his home. The wife is also not wrong in holding onto her memories. However, the question is specifically about the husband's actions. Since he's asking if he's in the wrong for not wanting the stains in the house, and given that his objection is about the physical presence rather than jealousy, it's possible he isn't in the wrong. So the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
