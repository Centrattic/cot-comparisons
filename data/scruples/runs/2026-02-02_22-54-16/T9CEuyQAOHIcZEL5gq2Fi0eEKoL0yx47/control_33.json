I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is wrong for not wanting his wife's prom dress, which has cum stains from a past partner, in their house. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The wife has this dress with stains from a previous sexual encounter. The husband didn't mind her past until this incident. The key points here are consent, boundaries, and personal comfort. \n\nThe husband's main issue isn't the fact that his wife had sex with someone else, but the presence of that person's bodily fluids in their home. He's not jealous about the past partners, but about the physical remnants. The wife, on the other hand, values the memories associated with the dress and doesn't want to clean it. \n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationship dynamics. In a committed relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. The husband is expressing a personal boundary regarding his home being free from another person's bodily fluids. While the wife's right to hold onto personal mementos is valid, the husband's discomfort is also a legitimate feeling. \n\nHowever, the wife's response might be contributing to the conflict. She's dismissing his feelings as jealousy, which he clarifies isn't the case. The husband is asking her to clean the dress out of respect for his feelings, but she refuses. This could lead to ongoing tension. \n\nBut who is in the wrong here? Legally, there's nothing against keeping a dress with stains. Emotionally, it's about mutual respect. The husband is trying to communicate his discomfort, and the wife is not honoring that request. However, the wife's attachment to the dress and her memories might be valid to her. \n\nIt's a tricky situation. The husband isn't wrong for wanting the stains removed if it's making him uncomfortable. The wife isn't wrong for valuing her past memories. But in a relationship, compromise is key. If the husband can't get his request respected, maybe there's an issue in their communication or conflict resolution. But the immediate question is about being in the wrong. \n\nSince the husband is expressing a boundary and the wife isn't respecting it, technically, the husband's request is about his personal comfort, not her wrongdoing. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. However, the wife's refusal could be seen as dismissive. But the question is whether the author is wrong. The answer might depend on the perspective. If the wife's actions are causing distress, then the husband's stance is valid. So B makes sense here.\n"
