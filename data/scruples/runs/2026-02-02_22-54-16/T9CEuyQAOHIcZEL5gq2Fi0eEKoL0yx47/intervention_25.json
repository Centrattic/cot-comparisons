I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person in the AITA story) is in the wrong regarding his wife's prom dress with another guy's cum stains. The author is upset about having another man's bodily fluids in his house and wants it cleaned, but the wife refuses, saying it's a memory and he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author isn't jealous about her past relationships but is now bothered by the physical presence of another man's stains. He's asking her to clean it, which is a reasonable request for hygiene and comfort. On the other hand, the wife has memories tied to the dress and doesn't want to clean it, seeing it as her right to keep mementos from her past.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? Well, the author's discomfort is about his own living space. He's not trying to control her past but doesn't want something he finds unpleasant in their home. The wife's stance is about her memories and autonomy. \n\nBut maybe the author's reaction is a bit over the top? Or is it reasonable to ask for cleanliness in a shared home? The key points are respect for each other's feelings. The author isn't being possessive about her past, just about the object in their house. The wife is resisting changing something she's attached to. \n\nIn relationships, partners often have to compromise. The author is making a request for his comfort, and the wife isn't budging. However, the wife's refusal might be seen as dismissive of his feelings. But if she's not causing harm beyond the stains, is it really her fault? Or is the author overreacting because he can't handle her keeping a memento?\n\nHmm. The author's main issue is the presence of another man's bodily fluids, not the act itself. That's a valid concern for someone sharing a home. The wife, however, values her memories. The question is whether the author's request is reasonable. Since the dress is in their home, the author has a right to express his discomfort. The wife's refusal might be inconsiderate, but she's not obligated to clean something she sees as a personal memory. \n\nBut in a shared living space, isn't there an expectation of mutual consideration? The author isn't asking for her to erase her past, just to clean something that's causing him distress. The wife's response of \"don't be jealous\" is unhelpful and might invalidate his feelings. So maybe the author is not wrong to ask, and the wife is being unreasonable. Alternatively, maybe the author is being a bit too focused on something trivial. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the stains are a health issue or just a personal preference. If it's the latter, perhaps the author is overstepping. But if it's about his own comfort in the home, it's a valid concern. Since the wife isn't removing it despite his requests, she might be in the wrong here. However, the author could be inconsiderate if he's not respecting her memories. \n\nWait, but the author isn't against her past relationships, just the physical reminder. So he's not being possessive. The problem is the object's presence in their home. The wife refuses to clean it, which is inconsiderate. So maybe the author is not in the wrong.\n"
