I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe husband and wife are married, 41 years old. The wife has a prom dress from her past with a stain from her ex's cum. She showed it to a friend, joked about it, and now the husband is upset. He told her to have it dry cleaned because he doesn't want another guy's semen in their house. She says he's overreacting and refuses to clean it. The husband feels uncomfortable, but the wife says he's being jealous and she has good memories of the night.\n\nSo the question is, is the husband in the wrong? Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the husband isn't jealous about her past relationships. He's okay with her having had other partners. The issue here is specifically about the physical presence of another man's biological fluid in their home. He's not upset about the memories or the fact that she had sex before marriage, but the actual stain. That seems like a personal boundary he's crossing. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife argues that it's part of her memories and she has the right to keep it. She didn't think to clean it herself until he brought it up. She might see it as a minor issue, especially since she's not doing anything to provoke him. The friend's comment and the wife's joke might have made the husband more aware of it, which he didn't mind before until that moment.\n\nIs the husband overreacting? Well, he's expressing a discomfort that's valid for him, even if others might not understand it. But in a relationship, both partners have to respect each other's boundaries. If the husband feels uncomfortable, he has a right to ask for it to be cleaned. However, the wife is also within her rights to decide to keep the dress as part of her personal history. \n\nThe key here is communication. The husband brought it up, but the wife isn't willing to comply. The problem is whether the husband's request is reasonable. From a health perspective, bodily fluids can harbor bacteria, so cleaning them might be practical. But if the wife is okay with it, the husband's request is more about emotional discomfort than health. \n\nIn terms of jealousy, the husband says he's not jealous about her past, so it's not about that. It's about the physical presence. However, some might argue that it's a trivial thing to be upset about. Others might say that if it's causing him distress, it's valid for him to want it cleaned. \n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? If he's being reasonable and respectful in his request, then no. But if he's being controlling or overstepping her personal items, then yes. Since the wife's dress is her personal property, he can't force her to clean it unless they had an agreement. But he's asking her to do so for his comfort. \n\nIn relationships, it's about mutual respect. The husband's request is a personal boundary, and the wife's refusal is also her right. However, if the husband is making it a big issue and causing conflict over something the wife doesn't see as a problem, that could be where he's in the wrong. But if the wife is being dismissive of his feelings, she's in the wrong. \n\nI think the husband is expressing a valid personal boundary. Even if others don't understand it, if it's causing him discomfort, he's entitled to ask for it. However, the wife has the right to decline. Since the husband's request is about his own comfort and not about controlling her past or her memories, he's not in the wrong. The wife might be in the wrong for not respecting his feelings, but the question is about the husband. So the answer is B (he's not in the wrong).\n"
