I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being uncomfortable with their wife's prom dress, which has cum stains from a previous partner, and wanting it cleaned.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife has had the dress for a long time, and the author never had an issue until the friend's visit when the stains were mentioned. The author's main issue isn't about jealousy over past relationships but about the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. The wife, on the other hand, values the dress as a memory and refuses to clean it despite the author's discomfort.\n\nMarital boundaries and mutual respect are key here. The author is expressing a legitimate concern about something that's in their shared living space. While it's true that the wife has the right to keep mementos from her past, the author's request for the dress to be cleaned is about personal comfort and hygiene in their home. The wife's insistence on keeping the dress despite the author's repeated requests could be seen as disregarding their partner's feelings and creating tension in the relationship.\n\nHowever, it's also important to note that the author's reaction might come from jealousy, even if they claim not to be. The wife's casual mention of the stain and her friend's reaction might have triggered the author's discomfort. The question is whether the author's demand for the dress to be cleaned is reasonable. Since the author is the one who now feels uncomfortable, and the wife is unwilling to comply, it's a matter of personal boundaries and compromise.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to respect each other's feelings. The author is trying to communicate a boundary, and the wife is not respecting that boundary. If the wife continues to refuse, it might indicate a lack of consideration for her partner's feelings. On the other hand, the wife might feel that her right to keep personal mementos is being overstepped. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's request is about their discomfort in their own home, which is a valid concern. The wife's refusal to accommodate this, despite knowing the author's feelings, might place the responsibility on the wife. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
