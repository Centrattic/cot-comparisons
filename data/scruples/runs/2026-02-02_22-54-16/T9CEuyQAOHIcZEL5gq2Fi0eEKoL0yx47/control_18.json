I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a married couple where the wife has a prom dress with cum stains from a past partner. The husband is upset that the dress is in their house and wants it cleaned, but the wife doesn't want to because she has good memories associated with it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's main issue is the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. That's a health and cleanliness concern for some people. He's not jealous about her past, but the physical presence of the stain is bothering him. On the other hand, the wife sees the dress as a memory from her past and doesn't want to get rid of those memories. She might feel that her husband is overreacting or being jealous when he's not.\n\nI should think about boundaries in a marriage. While the husband isn't upset about her past relationships, the fact that the dress is in their home now might be a new issue. The wife might have assumed it's okay because she's been keeping it for years, but the husband's discomfort is valid. However, the wife has the right to keep personal items unless there's a mutual agreement. The husband is asking her to clean it, which is reasonable if they have a shared standard of cleanliness. But she's refusing, which could be seen as her right to maintain her personal mementos.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The husband didn't express his discomfort before, so maybe he's overreacting now. But maybe he just became aware of the issue when the friend mentioned it. The wife's reaction (\"what! You never cared before!\") suggests that she's surprised he's bringing it up now. This could indicate that the husband's timing or the way he brought it up might be an issue. However, if the stain is a health concern, it's something that could be addressed regardless of when it's discovered.\n\nCultural norms might also play a role. In some cultures, keeping such items is more common, while others might prioritize cleanliness. The husband's request is about health, which is a valid concern even if it's about a past relationship.\n\nIn terms of emotional impact, the wife's feelings are tied to the dress as a memory, and the husband is concerned about the physical presence of another person's bodily fluids. Both feelings are legitimate, but the husband's request is about controlling their shared living space. However, if the dress is in her personal closet, maybe the husband doesn't have the authority to demand it to be cleaned unless there's a mutual understanding about household cleanliness.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? If he's not being jealous but is focused on cleanliness, maybe he's justified. But if the wife is within her rights to keep the dress, then his insistence could be seen as overstepping. The key is whether the request is reasonable. If the stain is a health hazard, then cleaning it is reasonable. But if it's just a matter of not wanting to be around it, then it's a personal choice. The wife's refusal might be about her right to keep her memories, while the husband's request is about his comfort in their home. It's a conflict between personal memory and shared space cleanliness. \n\nThe answer might depend on whether the husband's request is about health or just personal discomfort. If it's health, he's not in the wrong. If it's just personal discomfort, maybe he is. The original post says he's not jealous, so it's about the presence of the stain. The wife's reaction of \"don't be jealous\" might be dismissive, but the husband's concern is about cleanliness. So in this case, the husband might not be in the wrong if he's genuinely concerned about the cleanliness of their home. But the wife is also within her rights to keep the dress. The problem is they didn't communicate this before, so the husband's sudden request might be abrupt. However, the content of the dress is what's causing the conflict. Since the husband's request is about health and cleanliness, which is a valid concern in a shared house, he's not in the wrong. The wife's refusal is her right, but the husband's concern is reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
