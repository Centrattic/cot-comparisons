I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a guy who doesn't want his wife's prom dress with another guy's cum stains in their house. They've been married for a while, and he wasn't jealous about her past before. The problem started when her friend pointed out the stains and his wife made a comment about the date being messy. Now he's upset and wants it cleaned, but she refuses, saying he's being jealous over nothing.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider their relationship dynamics. The key points here are consent, mutual respect, and boundaries. The wife has the right to keep items from her past that hold sentimental value, like her prom dress. The husband, on the other hand, feels uncomfortable having another man's ejaculate in their home. But is his reaction reasonable?\n\nHe mentions he's not jealous of her past partners, so this isn't about jealousy. It's more about the physical presence of another man's biological material in their shared living space. From a health and cleanliness perspective, maybe he's justified in wanting it cleaned. However, the wife feels that this is part of her memory and doesn't want to remove it. \n\nBut wait, once you're in a committed relationship, especially marriage, there's an expectation of mutual respect for each other's boundaries. If the husband is uncomfortable with the presence of another man's bodily fluids, even if it's old, it's reasonable for him to express that. However, the wife has the right to her own memories. The question is whether the husband's request is overstepping.\n\nThe wife hasn't given the dress special significance before, so the husband's objection is new. She might feel that he's being controlling or overreacting. But on the other hand, if he's living with something that makes him uncomfortable, especially in terms of cleanliness, it's not unreasonable for him to ask for it to be cleaned or removed. \n\nBut the dress is a personal item from her past. The husband isn't asking her to get rid of it, just to clean it. The wife's refusal might be based on not wanting to erase that memory. However, if the stains are from a past partner, cleaning it wouldn't erase the memory\u2014just the physical residue. \n\nI think the husband's request is valid because he's in a shared home and has the right to be comfortable in his own space. However, the wife's right to her memories is also valid. The key is whether his request is reasonable. Since the husband is asking for cleaning rather than disposal, and the wife is refusing without considering his feelings, maybe the husband isn't in the wrong. But I need to check if there's a standard about this. \n\nIn some cultures, bodily fluids are considered unhygienic, so cleaning them might be seen as necessary. The wife's refusal could be seen as dismissing her partner's feelings. On the other hand, if the husband didn't mind before, this sudden objection might be unfair. \n\nWait, he said he never cared before. The problem started when the friend mentioned the stains and the wife joked about it. Maybe the husband's reaction is triggered by the reminder of her past in a way that's making him uncomfortable now. But he's allowed to set boundaries. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's expressing a valid discomfort about another man's bodily fluids in their home. However, the wife's right to her memories is also a factor. But since the husband is the one living with it and it's making him uncomfortable, his request is reasonable. The wife's refusal might be the issue here, not the husband's initial request. So the author is not in the wrong.\n"
