I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband being uncomfortable with his wife's prom dress that has what he believes are cum stains from a past partner. The wife is upset because he never cared before and now he's making a big deal about it. The husband is asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband isn't jealous about her past partners, which is a point in his favor. He's not upset about the sexual history itself but rather the presence of bodily fluids in their home. The wife, on the other hand, values the dress as a memory and doesn't want to get it cleaned. She also mentions that her ex was a \"mess,\" implying she didn't have a positive experience with him. \n\nThe husband's main issue is the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. While it's understandable that he might feel that way, especially if he's concerned about hygiene or something, the wife sees it as a part of her past and doesn't want to let go of the memory. \n\nNow, I need to think about the ethics here. Is it the husband's place to demand that something be cleaned if it's a personal item of her past? On one hand, he's in a committed relationship now and might feel that their home should be free from other people's biological material. On the other hand, the wife is an adult and has the right to keep mementos from her past unless they're causing harm. \n\nThe key here might be communication. The husband brought it up after the fact, not when the dress was first in the closet. The wife didn't know he was uncomfortable with it until after the friend's visit. The fact that he waited to express his issue could be seen as a problem. Maybe he should have addressed it earlier if it was bothering him. However, the situation is that the wife's friend brought it up, which might have triggered the husband's reaction. \n\nAnother angle is the emotional aspect. The wife has good memories of the night, even though the ex was a mess. The husband's request to clean it could be seen as dismissing her memories. But he's not saying she can't have the dress; he just wants it cleaned for practical reasons. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if two people are in a relationship and have agreed to share a home, they might have mutual expectations about what's acceptable in their living space. The presence of another person's bodily fluids could be considered unhygienic or inappropriate by some standards. However, the wife's right to her personal history and memories is also important. \n\nThe husband's actions might be seen as reasonable if they're about maintaining a clean home, but if there's no health risk, it's more about personal discomfort. In that case, the wife's feelings about her memories might outweigh the husband's discomfort. \n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? If he's overreacting by making her clean something that's a personal memento and not posing a real health issue, then maybe he's in the wrong. But if he's genuinely uncomfortable and they haven't discussed boundaries before, it's a communication issue. The answer might depend on the specific dynamics of their relationship and how they handle such matters.\n\nI think the correct answer here is B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's expressing his discomfort about having another person's bodily fluids in their home, which is a valid concern. The fact that he's not jealous about her past but about the physical presence of something in their shared space suggests that his issue is about personal boundaries in their home. The wife's refusal to clean it might be seen as disregarding his feelings, but the husband's stance is about his comfort in their home. So, he's not necessarily in the wrong.\n"
