I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting their wife's prom dress with another man's cum stains in the house. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the situation. The wife had the dress for a long time, and the author didn't mind until the friend's visit. The key here is that the author suddenly felt uncomfortable after hearing the wife talk about the stains. The wife's friend made a comment about the spots, and the wife laughed it off, which might have triggered the author's reaction.\n\nNow, from a relationship perspective, trust and boundaries are important. The author isn't upset about the past itself (since they stated they don't care about her past partners), but the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. That seems like a boundary issue. Even though the dress is a memory for the wife, the author's discomfort is valid because they share a living space and personal boundaries can vary between partners.\n\nThe wife's reaction is to dismiss the author's feelings as jealousy, but the author isn't necessarily being jealous about the past\u2014it's about the current situation in their home. The wife's refusal to clean the dress despite the author's request could be seen as not respecting the author's feelings. In a healthy relationship, both partners should consider each other's comfort levels, even if they don't fully understand them.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is overreacting because the dress is from the past and the wife is allowed to have her own memories. But the fact that the author is now uncomfortable and has communicated that, and the wife isn't willing to accommodate that request, could mean the author isn't in the wrong. The wife's insistence on keeping the dress as a memory might be prioritizing her feelings over the author's current discomfort, which isn't fair.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author has a valid request for their home's cleanliness and their own comfort. The wife's refusal without compromise could make her the one in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
