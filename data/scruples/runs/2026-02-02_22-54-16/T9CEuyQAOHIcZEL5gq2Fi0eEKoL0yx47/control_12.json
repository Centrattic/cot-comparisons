I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The husband found out that his wife's prom dress has cum stains from a past date. He didn't mind her past relationships before, but now he doesn't want that dress in their house. The wife thinks it's just a memory and doesn't want to clean it. They've had an argument since, and the dress is still there.\n\nFirst, I should consider the husband's perspective. He's not jealous about her past partners in general, but the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home is making him uncomfortable. That's a valid feeling. Even if he's okay with her past, the idea of that specific item being there might cross a line for him. It's about personal boundaries and comfort in their shared living space.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife has a sentimental attachment to the dress. She views it as a memory from her prom night, which might be significant to her. She doesn't see the problem because she's not the one who had the stain, and she's already moved on. Her friend's comment led to the husband finding out, which might have been an oversight on her part. She's also questioning his jealousy, which could indicate she feels he's being unfair now.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationships, it's common for people to have different thresholds for what they find acceptable regarding their partner's past. The husband's discomfort here isn't about jealousy but about the physical reminder of her past in their home. The wife's refusal to clean it shows she values her memory over his comfort. This is a conflict of values. \n\nIs the husband overreacting? Maybe, but his feelings are real. However, the wife's insistence on keeping the stain might be inconsiderate of his feelings. In a healthy relationship, both parties should consider each other's feelings. The wife might be dismissive of his concerns by calling him jealous, when his issue is more about the physical presence of the stain rather than her past. \n\nBut then, the husband's request is reasonable: he wants the item cleaned because of the stain. The wife's refusal is also her right, but she might not be respecting his feelings enough. However, it's also about personal memories versus shared living space. If the husband can't handle that, maybe he's being a bit overly sensitive. But it's his home too, and he's entitled to his comfort.\n\nI think the key here is whether the husband's request is reasonable. He's not asking her to get rid of the dress, just to clean it. The wife is resisting because it's a memory. It's a conflict between personal history and mutual comfort. Neither is entirely wrong, but the husband's stance is about a specific discomfort that's affecting their relationship. The wife might be right in valuing her memory, but she's not considering his feelings adequately. However, the husband might be overreacting because the stain is from the past and not an ongoing issue. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe the husband is not wrong because he's expressing his discomfort in a reasonable way. The wife's response might be dismissive, but she has her own perspective. The question is whether the husband is in the wrong. If the answer is A, then the husband is in the wrong if he overreacted. If B, he's not. Given that he's asking for a reasonable action (cleaning) and she's refusing, but her stance is about her memory, it's a bit of a toss-up. But since he's not asking her to erase her past, just to clean the stain, maybe he's in the right. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
