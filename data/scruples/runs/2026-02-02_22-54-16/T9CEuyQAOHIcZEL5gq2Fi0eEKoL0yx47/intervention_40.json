I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the husband (or partner) is upset about his wife's prom dress that has cum stains from a past partner. The wife doesn't want to get it cleaned, saying it's a memory, while the husband is uncomfortable with it in their home.\n\nFirst, the key points: The wife has had the dress in her closet for a long time, and the husband never cared before. The issue came up when her friend commented on the stains and mentioned the date being a mess. The husband then expressed discomfort, not about the fact that she had sex with someone else (he says he's not jealous of her past), but specifically about the biological stains from another man. The wife is resistant, saying he's overreacting and not to be jealous.\n\nSo, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nMarital relationships involve compromise and mutual respect. The husband's discomfort is about the physical presence of another person's bodily fluids in their home. Even though he's not jealous of her past relationships, the idea of another man's semen in their house might be a hygiene or emotional issue for him. However, the wife has a different perspective, valuing the memory attached to the dress and not seeing the stains as a problem. \n\nIs the husband overreacting? Well, if he's not jealous about her past, then his issue is purely about the physical stain. Some might argue that once the relationship ended and the dress is now in their home, the husband's right to be uncomfortable should be respected. Others might say that the wife's right to keep a cherished memory is more important, and the husband shouldn't impose his discomfort on her. \n\nBut the problem here is that the husband is now bringing it up after many years, when it was never an issue before. The wife's friend's comment might have triggered him, but she had the dress in her closet for a long time. The husband's sudden objection could be seen as inconsistent. However, people's feelings can change over time, and maybe he's just now realizing something he didn't mind before. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife is holding onto her memory, which is valid. But she's also not considering her partner's feelings. The husband is trying to communicate his discomfort, which is reasonable. The wife's response of \"don't be jealous\" might dismiss his valid feelings, even if they are about a past event. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The husband isn't wrong for expressing his discomfort, but the wife isn't wrong for holding onto her memory. However, if the husband is now making it an issue after years, some might say he's overreacting. But if he's truly uncomfortable, he has a right to his feelings. \n\nI think the key is that the husband is not being jealous about her past relationships, so his issue isn't about her fidelity but about the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. That's a personal preference, and in a relationship, both partners need to find a solution that works for them. The wife, however, is refusing to compromise, which might not be considerate of his feelings. \n\nSo, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing his discomfort, but the wife's refusal to clean the dress could be seen as dismissive of his feelings. However, the original question is whether the author (husband) is in the wrong. If the husband is just expressing his preference and not trying to control her, then he's not in the wrong. The wife's reaction is what might be problematic. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
