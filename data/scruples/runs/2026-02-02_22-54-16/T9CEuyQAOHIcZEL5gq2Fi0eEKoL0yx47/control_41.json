I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves a wife's prom dress that has stains from a past partner's semen. The husband is upset about this and wants it cleaned, while the wife is resistant, saying he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The couple has been married for a while, and the husband says he's not jealous about her past. The issue isn't about infidelity but about the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. The husband's discomfort is about the physical presence of something he finds unpleasant, not about the past relationship itself. \n\nThe wife's perspective is that these are her memories and she doesn't want to erase them. She might see the dress as a personal keepsake, important for her own reasons. However, the husband is within his rights to express discomfort about something being in their shared home. \n\nIn relationships, both partners' feelings matter. The husband isn't being jealous of past relationships but is concerned about a specific item. The wife, on the other hand, values her memories and may not see the issue. It's a conflict between personal comfort and respect for each other's feelings. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he's not being unfaithful or controlling. He's expressing a reasonable request for cleanliness and comfort. The wife is refusing, which might be because of her attachment to the dress. But if they're a married couple, the home is a shared space, and his request isn't unreasonable. \n\nHowever, the wife's refusal could be seen as dismissive of his feelings. If he's asked her to clean it and she continues to not do so, despite the discussion, that could be seen as her being in the wrong. But the initial act of the husband bringing it up is his right. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the husband isn't being unreasonable. He's asking for something that affects their shared living space. The wife's attachment to the dress is her personal preference, but the husband's discomfort is valid. The key is whether his request is overstepping. Since he's not demanding she erase her past but just wants the item cleaned, he's within his rights. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
