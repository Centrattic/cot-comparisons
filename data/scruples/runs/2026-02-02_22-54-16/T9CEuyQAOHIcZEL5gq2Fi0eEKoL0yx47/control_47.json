I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who posted the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's wife having a prom dress with cum stains from a past partner, and the author not wanting those stains in their home. The wife is upset that he's now bringing it up, even though she casually mentioned it in front of him. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is married, doesn't mind his wife's past, but is now uncomfortable with the physical remnants of her past. The wife had the dress in their closet for years, and after showing it to a friend and making a joke about it, the author confronts her about the stains. She's resistant, saying he's overreacting and not wanting to lose the memories.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting another man's bodily fluids in their home. Let's consider perspectives. The author's argument is about personal boundaries and not wanting someone else's bodily fluids in their shared space. That seems reasonable to me. Even if he wasn't jealous of her past, the presence of another person's semen in their home could be a health or comfort issue. On the other hand, the wife might see the dress as a personal memento, and the author's sudden objection could feel like an overreaction or a shift in his feelings.\n\nBut wait, the author said he didn't care about her past or the fact that someone else had sex with her, but the presence of the stain is an issue. That's a bit of a distinction. Jealousy is about the act itself, but the stain is a physical remnant. Some might argue that once the act is over, the stain is just a residue and not a big deal unless there's a health concern. However, others might feel that having someone else's bodily fluids in their home is unhygienic or uncomfortable, regardless of the context.\n\nAlso, the wife brought up the stain in front of him during a casual conversation, which might mean she wasn't expecting him to be upset. The fact that she said \"you never cared before\" suggests that he hadn't mentioned it before this incident. His reaction now could be about personal boundaries rather than jealousy. The wife's resistance to cleaning it could be about attachment to memories versus the author's discomfort.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people have different levels of comfort regarding such things. The author is expressing a valid personal boundary, and the wife is defending her right to keep the dress as a memory. There's a conflict between respecting the author's boundaries and the wife's sentimental value. \n\nIs the author wrong for having this boundary? I don't think so. It's about a shared living space and personal comfort. The wife might need to respect his feelings by cleaning it, even if she doesn't agree. Alternatively, maybe the author is being too rigid, but since he's not jealous of her past, it's more about his own comfort. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's expressing a personal boundary in their shared home. The wife's refusal to clean it despite his discomfort could be her issue, not his.\n"
