I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband being upset about his wife's prom dress having cum stains from a past partner. The wife doesn't want to clean it, saying it's part of her memories, while the husband is uncomfortable with it in their home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband is not jealous of her past partners but is bothered by the physical presence of another man's bodily fluid in their house. He's asking her to clean it, which seems like a reasonable request because he's uncomfortable. The wife, on the other hand, values the dress as a memory and doesn't see the issue, even after the husband expressed his discomfort. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. The husband did express his feelings, but the wife dismissed them as jealousy. However, the husband's issue isn't with her past sex life but with the specific item. It's about personal boundaries. If he's not comfortable with that item in their home, it's understandable. The wife's refusal to clean it might be seen as not respecting his feelings, even if she has her own reasons.\n\nBut does that make the husband wrong? Well, he's respecting her past in terms of not being jealous, but he's also asking for his own comfort. It's a matter of mutual respect. If the wife continues to ignore his request after multiple discussions, that could be a problem. However, the husband isn't violating any norms by expressing his discomfort. He's not being controlling about her past, just about a specific object. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife has the right to keep personal mementos, but she needs to consider her partner's feelings. The husband isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary. The issue here is more about differing values and how to balance them. The husband isn't being unreasonable in wanting the dress cleaned if it's making him uncomfortable. The wife's response, however, is dismissive, which could strain the relationship. \n\nIn summary, neither is entirely in the wrong, but the husband is justified in his request. The wife should consider his feelings and maybe find a compromise, like keeping the dress in a less accessible place if she doesn't want to clean it. However, the husband isn't wrong for wanting it cleaned. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
