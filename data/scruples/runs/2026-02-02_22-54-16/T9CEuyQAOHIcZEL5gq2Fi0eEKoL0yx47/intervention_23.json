I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband not wanting his wife's prom dress with another man's cum stains in their house. The wife is upset that he's overreacting, while he's uncomfortable with it. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband didn't mind her past relationships before, but the cum stains on the dress are making him uncomfortable. The wife sees it as part of her memory and doesn't want to get it cleaned. The question is whether the husband is wrong for feeling that way.\n\nJealousy is a common issue in relationships. However, the husband's discomfort isn't about her past but about the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. That's a different issue. Maybe he's not being jealous in a possessive way but rather about hygiene and boundaries. \n\nThe wife's reaction is that he's overreacting. But if the husband is uncomfortable, isn't it reasonable for him to express that? The problem might be the wife not respecting his feelings. However, some might argue that the husband should accept her memories, even if they're uncomfortable. \n\nI need to check if there's any cultural or social norms here. In some contexts, people might prioritize personal memories and past relationships, while others might focus on current relationship boundaries. The husband's stance is about what he's okay with in their shared home. \n\nAlso, the wife's friends were aware of the stains, and she was open about it. The husband only expressed discomfort after the fact. Maybe the timing of his reaction matters? But if a person has a boundary, it's valid even if they didn't think about it before. \n\nSo, considering all this, the husband isn't wrong for setting a boundary in their home. The wife might need to respect his feelings, even if she disagrees. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
