I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's prom dress with another man's cum stains in their house. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife had the dress for a long time, and the author didn't mind until a friend made a comment about the stains. The wife then laughed about it, and the author expressed discomfort, asking her to get it cleaned. She refused, saying he was overreacting.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about boundaries and comfort in a relationship. The author isn't upset about her past relationships but the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. That's a common concern; some people find it gross, others don't. The wife, however, values the memories associated with the dress and refuses to clean it, which the author finds unacceptable.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, both partners have valid perspectives. The author has the right to his feelings, especially in matters of cleanliness and what he's comfortable with. The wife's right to hold onto personal mementos is also valid. However, since they live together, the presence of something that makes the author uncomfortable could affect their shared living environment and mutual respect.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for setting this boundary. Since the author isn't being controlling about her past but about the physical item in their home, it's more about personal preference. However, the wife's refusal to accommodate his request might be seen as dismissive of his feelings. \n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, it's a matter of differing values. The author isn't wrong for having his feelings, but the wife isn't wrong for valuing her memories. The issue is their inability to find a compromise. The author's request is reasonable if it affects his comfort in their home. However, the wife's stance that she won't clean it because he's being jealous might be the real problem here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing his discomfort and asking her to clean it. The wife's refusal is where the tension lies, but the author's initial stance is just about his personal boundaries. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
