I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a wife keeping her ex's cum-stained prom dress in their home, and the husband being uncomfortable with it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The husband is not jealous of her past partners but is specifically upset about the physical remnants (cum stains) on the dress. The wife feels it's part of her memory and doesn't want to clean it. The husband wants it cleaned to remove another man's bodily fluids from their home.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about comfort with having someone else's biological material in the shared living space. The husband is expressing a personal boundary. Even though the wife has a sentimental attachment, the husband's request seems reasonable. It's about their home environment and his discomfort with that specific item. Jealousy isn't the issue here; he's not upset about her past relationships, just the physical presence of another person's bodily fluids.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, most people might agree that having another person's bodily fluids in the home, especially from a past partner, is unsanitary and uncomfortable. The wife's argument about memories might be valid emotionally, but it's a matter of mutual respect and addressing both partners' comfort levels. The husband is asking for a simple action (dry cleaning) to remove the stains, which would resolve the issue without erasing the memory. \n\nThe wife's refusal to clean it could be seen as disregarding her husband's feelings. While she has her own feelings about the dress, it's in their shared home, so both partners' needs should be considered. The husband isn't being controlling about her past but is asking for a reasonable adjustment to their living space. \n\nTherefore, the husband isn't in the wrong. He's asserting his boundary in their shared home. The wife needs to acknowledge his discomfort and find a compromise, like cleaning the dress. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
