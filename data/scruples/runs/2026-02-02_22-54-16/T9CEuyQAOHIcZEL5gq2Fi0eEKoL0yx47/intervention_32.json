I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting his wife's prom dress that has cum stains from a past partner in their house. The wife is resistant to getting it cleaned.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of a healthy relationship. Trust and respect are key. The author isn't upset about the past sex itself but the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. That's a different issue than jealousy over past relationships. The wife, on the other hand, sees the dress as a memory and is dismissive of his discomfort, even calling him jealous. \n\nI should think about boundaries. The author is making a valid point about what he's comfortable with in his own home. It's reasonable for him to express that he doesn't want something that makes him uneasy. However, the wife's reaction might be seen as invalidating his feelings. She's not considering his discomfort and is being dismissive, which isn't respectful.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's expressing his personal boundaries without being judgmental about her past, he's in a reasonable position. The issue here is about mutual respect and communication. If the wife can't respect his wishes, that's her issue. The author isn't wrong for setting that boundary. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
