I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post (AITA, or \"Am I the Asshole\") is in the wrong. The situation involves his wife's old prom dress with cum stains from a previous partner. The author is upset about the stains and wants it cleaned, but the wife refuses, saying he's being jealous.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author isn't jealous about her past partners but is uncomfortable with the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. The wife, on the other hand, values the memory associated with the dress and doesn't want to clean it because it's part of her past.\n\nIs the author being unreasonable? He's not upset about her past relationships, which is a good point. Jealousy about past partners isn't the issue here. Instead, it's about the current situation of having another person's bodily fluids in their shared living space. That seems like a reasonable concern. After all, most people would be uncomfortable with that. The wife's friend made an \"ew\" comment, which might indicate others also find it gross.\n\nBut the wife argues that it's her memory and she doesn't want to erase it. However, once they're married and living together, keeping such an item in the house could be seen as something that affects both partners. The author has the right to express discomfort about having another person's biological material in their home. The fact that the wife didn't mention the stains before and only did so in front of a friend might add to the author's discomfort.\n\nThe question is whether the author is overreacting. If the wife's keeping the dress with the stains is causing the author distress, then it's valid for him to ask for it to be cleaned. The wife's refusal might be the problem here. She's dismissing his feelings as jealousy, but he's not necessarily being jealous of the past relationship, just the physical presence of the stains. \n\nIn terms of boundaries, once married, both partners might have a say in what's kept in the home. The wife might feel it's her personal item, but the author has a right to his comfort level in their shared space. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting it cleaned. The wife's refusal without considering his feelings could be the issue here. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's justified in his request for cleanliness and personal comfort in their home.\n"
