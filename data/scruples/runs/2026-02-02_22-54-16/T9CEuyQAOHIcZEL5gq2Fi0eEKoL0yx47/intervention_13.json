I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person who wrote this (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's prom dress, which has cum stains from a past partner, in their house.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they don't care that his wife had sex with others or that there are stains. The issue is specifically about the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. The wife is upset because the author is reacting now when he never cared before. She values the memories associated with the dress.\n\nFrom a perspective of personal boundaries, the author might feel entitled to a home free from others' bodily fluids. But the wife sees it as a personal memento. The author isn't being jealous about her past but about the physical presence of the stains. However, the wife perceives this as overreacting or jealousy, which the author denies. \n\nLegally, there's no right or wrong here\u2014this is a personal matter. Emotionally, the author's discomfort is valid, but the wife's feelings about the dress are also her own. The key point is whether the author is overstepping by asking for it to be cleaned. Since the author isn't trying to control her memories but is uncomfortable with the stains, it's a matter of mutual respect. The wife's refusal to clean it despite the author's feelings might be where the tension lies. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing his discomfort, but the situation requires both parties to find a compromise. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and he's not violating any rights or laws, I'd lean towards him not being in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
