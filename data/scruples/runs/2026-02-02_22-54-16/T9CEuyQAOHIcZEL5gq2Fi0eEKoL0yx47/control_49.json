I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a wife's old prom dress that has stains from her past partner. The husband is upset about those stains and wants it cleaned, but the wife doesn't want to because it's a memory. \n\nFirst, I need to consider what's acceptable in relationships. The husband isn't jealous about her past, which is good. But now he's objecting to the physical remnants of that past in their home. The question is whether his request is reasonable. \n\nThe dress has been in her closet for a long time, and the husband never cared before. Now he's bringing it up after hearing about the stains from a friend. Maybe he's overreacting because he suddenly feels uncomfortable with something he didn't mind before. But on the other hand, he's now married and has a say in what's in their shared home. \n\nThe wife's side is that it's a memory she cherishes. She might see it as part of her history. But the husband is the one living with it now. There's a balance between respecting each other's feelings. If the husband is uncomfortable, maybe it's reasonable for him to ask for it to be cleaned. However, if the wife refuses, is he in the wrong for pushing? \n\nAlso, the friend's reaction was \"ew,\" which might have made the husband more aware. The wife's casual mention of the stains could have triggered his discomfort. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The husband expressed his feelings, but the wife is dismissing them as jealousy. The issue is whether his feelings are valid. If he doesn't mind the sexual history but the physical stains, that's a different issue. \n\nSo, is he overreacting? If the dress is a cherished memory, removing it might cause resentment. But if the presence of another's bodily fluids makes him uncomfortable, maybe he's justified. The answer might depend on cultural norms or relationship dynamics. \n\nIn many relationships, partners might have different thresholds for such things. The husband's stance is about cleanliness and the current living environment. The wife's stance is about personal history. It's a conflict between present comfort and past memories. \n\nI think the husband is not in the wrong because he's expressing a valid concern about his home's cleanliness and his own comfort. However, the wife has the right to her memories. Since the husband is asking for a reasonable action (dry cleaning) that doesn't erase the memory, just removes the stains, his request might be reasonable. The wife's refusal could be seen as dismissing his feelings, but the husband isn't wrong for having them.\n"
