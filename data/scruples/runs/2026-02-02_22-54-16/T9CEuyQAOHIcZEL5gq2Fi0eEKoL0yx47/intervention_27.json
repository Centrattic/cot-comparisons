I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's prom dress with another man's cum stains in their house. They've given the scenario where the wife's friend comments on the stains, the wife laughs about it, and the husband is upset and wants it cleaned.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple is married, and the husband says he's not jealous of her past partners. The issue isn't about jealousy per se, but about the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. The wife, however, doesn't want to get it cleaned because it's a memory for her. \n\nThe husband's main point is about wanting to remove what he considers an unpleasant or unhygienic item from their home. The wife's argument is about preserving her memories. So, it's a clash between his comfort and her emotional attachment. \n\nI should think about boundaries in relationships. If the husband isn't upset about her past, but just the physical presence of the stains, is that reasonable? Some people might find bodily fluids unclean, while others might not care. The wife's reaction suggests she's not bothered by it, which could indicate she doesn't think it's an issue. \n\nBut the husband's request is about cleanliness and maybe a sense of territoriality. However, the wife is within her rights to keep the dress if it's her personal item. However, if they live together, they should consider each other's comfort. The husband's request is valid, but the wife's refusal might be seen as dismissive. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, maybe the husband is not in the wrong because he's expressing his discomfort. However, the wife might not be in the wrong either because she's entitled to her own memories. The problem is communication. They need to find a compromise. But the husband is asking if he's in the wrong. If the issue is about his own comfort, then maybe he's not wrong. But if the wife's emotional attachment is valid, then the husband's request could be seen as overstepping. \n\nAnother angle: the husband's request is about hygiene. Cum is a bodily fluid, and some people might find it gross. Even if it's a memory for her, from a health perspective, keeping it uncleaned might be a problem. However, if it's dry and not a health risk, maybe that's not the main issue. \n\nThe wife's reaction of laughing and showing the dress to her friend might also indicate that she's not ashamed, which could make the husband feel that she's flaunting her past, which he might find uncomfortable. But since he said he's not jealous, it's more about the physical presence. \n\nIn summary, the husband is expressing a valid concern about something in their home that he finds unpleasant. The wife is attached to it. The question is whether his request is reasonable. If he's okay with her past but not the physical memory, it's a personal boundary. The wife has to respect his feelings. So, maybe the husband is not in the wrong. But if the wife is being dismissive, then the husband's request is valid. Therefore, the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
