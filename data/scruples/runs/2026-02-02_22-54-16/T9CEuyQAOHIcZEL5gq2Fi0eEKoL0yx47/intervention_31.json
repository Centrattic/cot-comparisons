I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting his wife's prom dress with another man's cum stains in their home. The wife doesn't want to get it cleaned, saying it's part of her memories and he's being jealous. The author says he's not jealous about her past but doesn't want the stains in their house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are about boundaries and mutual respect. The husband is uncomfortable with the physical reminder of his wife's past sexual relationship in their home. The wife views the dress as a memory and doesn't want to remove it, feeling the husband is being jealous. \n\nThe husband's discomfort isn't about jealousy per se, as he clarifies he's not upset about her past partners. Instead, it's about the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. That's a legitimate concern about personal space and cleanliness. However, the wife's stance is about preserving her memories, which is also a personal right. \n\nNow, whether the husband is in the wrong. If he's not being controlling or abusive, but simply expressing a boundary, then he's not wrong. However, the wife's refusal to compromise might be the issue here. The question is whether the husband overstepped by enforcing his boundary without considering her emotional attachment. But since the husband's request is about the physical presence of the item (cleaning it), which is a reasonable hygiene issue, it's within his right. \n\nThe wife's argument that he's being jealous is a mischaracterization; he's not upset about her past but about the current presence of the stain. So the husband is acting on a valid concern. The wife's refusal to clean it might be more about her attachment, but the husband's right to his comfort in the shared home is also valid. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's expressing a legitimate boundary, and the issue here is about respecting each other's boundaries. The wife isn't wrong either, but the husband isn't in the wrong for wanting the dress cleaned.\n"
