I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me try to break down the situation.\n\nThe husband and wife are married, and the wife has an old prom dress with cum stains from a past partner. The husband didn't mind before, but now he's upset about the stains in their house. The wife says it's part of her memories and refuses to clean it. The husband wants it cleaned because he doesn't want another man's bodily fluids in their home. The question is whether the husband is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife's side: she has a sentimental attachment to the dress. It's from her past, and she doesn't see the issue. She's even shared the story with a friend, which the husband found out about. The fact that she laughed and joked about it suggests she didn't think it was a big deal before. The husband's side: he's not jealous of her past partners, but now he's uncomfortable with the physical remains of another man's presence in their home. It's about the current living environment and personal boundaries.\n\nThe key points here are consent and personal boundaries. The husband didn't know about the stains before, even though the dress was in the closet. He's now expressing a boundary that he's not comfortable with the stains being in the house. The wife, on the other hand, values the memories and sees the dress as part of her history. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. The husband's reaction is about his personal comfort in their shared space. The wife might feel that his request is an overreaction, but it's his right to feel that way. However, the wife also has the right to her memories. The question is whether the husband's request is reasonable. \n\nSince the dress is in the house, and the husband is now expressing discomfort, he's within his rights to ask for it to be cleaned or removed. The wife's refusal could be seen as disregarding his feelings. But is he in the wrong for making that request? Or is she in the wrong for not respecting his feelings? \n\nThe husband isn't being jealous about her past, which is clear. His issue is with the physical presence of the stains. It's a matter of personal boundaries. If the wife doesn't want to clean it, maybe it should be stored elsewhere. However, since it's in their home, the husband's request is a valid one. The wife might need to consider his feelings here. \n\nBut is the husband overstepping? If the dress is in their shared home, and he's now expressing a boundary, it's reasonable for him to ask for it to be cleaned or removed. The wife's response of \"don't be jealous\" might be dismissive of his actual concern. \n\nSo, the husband is not in the wrong because he's setting a boundary about what he's comfortable with in their home. The wife, however, might need to find a compromise. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
