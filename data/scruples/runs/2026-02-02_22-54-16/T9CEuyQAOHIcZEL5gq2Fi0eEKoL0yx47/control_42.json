I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's prom dress with cum stains in their house. The situation is a bit delicate.\n\nFirst, the author isn't jealous about her past partners, which is a good point. He's not upset about the affair itself but the physical remnants. The dress has stains from another guy, and he wants it cleaned. His wife, on the other hand, values the memories associated with it and refuses to clean it.\n\nSo, is he overstepping? Well, the house is their shared space. He has a right to his comfort. Even though it's a personal item for her, keeping something that has bodily fluids from another person might be a hygiene issue. But at the same time, she has emotional attachments to it.\n\nLegally, maybe he doesn't have a right to demand it be cleaned, but emotionally, it's about mutual respect. If he's uncomfortable, it's reasonable to ask. However, she's not obligated to comply if it's important to her. The key here is communication and finding a compromise.\n\nHe's not being jealous of the affair itself, just the physical presence. That's a valid concern. But she feels it's part of her history. The problem is they haven't resolved it yet. Maybe he should consider discussing it more, finding a middle ground, like storing it elsewhere or using a container. But based on the scenario, he's within his rights to express discomfort. So the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
