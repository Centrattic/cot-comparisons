I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. So the scenario is that the husband is upset about his wife's prom dress that has cum stains from a past partner. He wants it cleaned, but she refuses, saying it's a memory and that he's being jealous. The user thinks the author (husband) isn't wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the husband is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are: the husband is not jealous of her past, but he's uncomfortable with another man's bodily fluids in their home. The wife is keeping the dress as a memory, even though it's a sensitive issue for him now. They had the conversation, he's asked her to clean it, she refused. Now there's tension.\n\nSo, from a relationship perspective, communication is key. The husband expressed his discomfort, which is valid because people have different boundaries. If he's not okay with it, that's his right. However, maybe the wife feels her memories are important. But the husband's request is about their shared living space. He's not objecting to her past, just the physical presence of the stain. So is he overreacting? Some might say that since they've been together a long time, he should accept her past. But others would say he's justified in his comfort in the home.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms. In some cultures, keeping such items might be more accepted, others not. Also, the fact that the wife was joking about it in front of her friend might have made the husband feel embarrassed or uncomfortable. The husband's request is reasonable because he's the one living with the item. The wife's refusal could be seen as dismissing his feelings. \n\nBut is it the husband's place to dictate what she keeps? Maybe the wife feels it's her personal choice. But since it's in their home, both partners might need to find a compromise. However, the husband's discomfort is valid. So, whether he's in the wrong depends on whose feelings are more important. If the wife isn't willing to accommodate his request, but he's the one who feels uncomfortable, perhaps he's not in the wrong. \n\nBut some might argue that he's being possessive or not respecting her past. However, the key is that he's not jealous of the past relationship, just the physical stain. So maybe the husband is within his rights to ask for it to be cleaned. The fact that the wife laughed about it in front of her friend could have made him feel that the joke was inappropriate, hence his reaction. \n\nUltimately, the husband's request is about his comfort in their home. He's not asking for the dress to be destroyed, just cleaned. If the wife refuses, it's her choice, but the husband isn't wrong for expressing his discomfort. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
