I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a man objecting to his wife's prom dress that has stains from a previous sexual encounter. The key points here are about boundaries in a marriage, respect for memories, and the emotional aspects.\n\nFirst, the man isn't jealous about her past partners, which he mentions. So it's not about her past relationships but the physical presence of another person's bodily fluids in their home. That seems like a personal boundary issue. The wife, on the other hand, values the memories associated with the dress and doesn't want to get it cleaned. She also laughs off the situation, implying she's not taking his discomfort seriously.\n\nThe man's main argument is about not wanting another man's bodily fluids in his house. That's a hygiene concern and a matter of personal comfort. The wife's response is about her memories and dismissing his feelings as overreacting. When someone's comfort is affected by something like this, it's reasonable for them to ask for a change, especially in a shared living space.\n\nHowever, the wife's stance is that she has the right to keep her memories. The question is whether respecting her memories overrides his discomfort. In a marriage, communication and compromise are essential. The man has expressed his feelings, but the wife isn't budging. That could lead to tension. But does that make him wrong?\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the man is within his rights to express his discomfort. The wife's refusal to address it might be the issue here. He's not being controlling about her past but about a specific item in their home. The problem is that she doesn't respect his boundary. So the author isn't wrong for having this request. However, the wife's reaction might be more problematic. But the question is about the author's wrongness. Since he's asking for something reasonable (cleaning the dress) and she's refusing, he's not necessarily in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
