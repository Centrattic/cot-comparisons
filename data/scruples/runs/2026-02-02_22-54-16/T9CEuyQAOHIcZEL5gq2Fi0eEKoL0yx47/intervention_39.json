I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is a husband who's upset because his wife has a prom dress with another guy's cum stains. He's asking if he's at fault for not wanting that in his house. The wife met him in college, and he's not jealous about her past partners. The dress has been in her closet forever, but now he's objecting after she showed it to a friend and mentioned the stains. The wife doesn't want to clean it, saying he's overreacting and being jealous. They've been having awkwardness since.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about boundaries, respect, and maybe jealousy. The husband's issue isn't about the sexual history itself\u2014since he says he doesn't care about her past\u2014but rather having another man's bodily fluids in their home. The wife, on the other hand, sees it as a memory and doesn't want to remove it. \n\nI need to consider if the husband is overstepping. Is it reasonable for him to want the dress cleaned? On one hand, he's the husband now, and maybe he's uncomfortable with that specific item in the house. On the other hand, the wife has a right to her memories. But maybe the problem is that he's reacting to the presence of another man's residue, which could be seen as possessive or controlling if he's not okay with her past. However, he clarifies he's not jealous of her past, just the physical presence in their home. \n\nIs there a way to balance both perspectives? The husband might be within his right to express his discomfort, especially if it's his home and he's not okay with that item being there. But the wife might feel it's her choice. The question is whether he's wrong in asserting his preference. \n\nIn many relationships, partners have to respect each other's boundaries. If the husband is uncomfortable, he has a right to voice that. However, if the wife refuses to comply and it's causing tension, maybe they need to find a compromise. But the main question is about who is in the wrong. \n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong because he's not objecting to her past but to the physical item in their home. He's setting a boundary about his living space. The wife might not be in the wrong either for holding onto her memories, but the issue is whether he's overstepping. Since he's not being jealous of her past but about the specific item, he's probably not in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
