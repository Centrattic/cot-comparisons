I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's prom dress, which has cum stains from a past partner, in their house. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife has the dress in her closet for a long time, and the author never minded until a friend came over and the wife mentioned the stains. The author then asked her to get it cleaned, citing discomfort with another man's seminal fluid in the house. The wife refuses, saying he's overreacting and that it's about her memories.\n\nSo, the question is about whether the author is wrong for his stance. The user thinks the author is not wrong, but wants to know what I think. \n\nI should think about the context. The author isn't jealous of her past relationships but is uncomfortable with the physical traces of her past. It's about personal boundaries and what he's comfortable with in their shared home. The wife, on the other hand, values the memories associated with the dress and doesn't see a problem with keeping it. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? It's a matter of differing perspectives. The author's discomfort is valid; he doesn't want another person's bodily fluids in his home. The wife's right to keep personal mementos is also valid. Neither side is inherently wrong; it's a conflict of personal boundaries. However, the author is within his rights to express his discomfort and request the dress be cleaned for hygiene reasons. The wife's refusal is her choice, but the author isn't wrong for wanting it removed. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because the author is expressing a valid concern about his living environment. Jealousy isn't the issue here; it's about personal space and hygiene. Since he's not being controlling but rather setting a boundary, he's not wrong. The wife is also not wrong in keeping her memories, but they need to find a compromise. So, the answer should be B.\n"
