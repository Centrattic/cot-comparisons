I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by understanding the situation. The author is a husband (or partner) who's upset that his wife's prom dress has cum stains from her past partner. They met in college, and he's not jealous about her past, but this specific issue came up when her friend was over. The friend noticed the stains, and the wife made a joke about her date \"wading a mess\" and not taking him off before. The husband then confronted her about not wanting the stains in his house, and she said he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics of their relationship. The husband says he's not jealous about her past partners, so maybe this isn't about jealousy. He's more concerned about the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. That seems like a boundary issue. In a committed relationship, people often have their own boundaries about what they're comfortable with. So the husband's discomfort might be about personal hygiene or the symbolic aspect of the dress being a reminder of a past sexual encounter.\n\nThe wife, on the other hand, is emotionally attached to the dress as it holds good memories for her. She might see it as a personal memento and not understand why her partner is upset. The problem here is conflicting boundaries. The husband is asking her to remove the stain for his comfort, but she's not willing to, which is causing tension.\n\nNow, is the husband in the wrong for expressing his discomfort? If they had discussed boundaries earlier, maybe there's an expectation of mutual respect in maintaining the home environment. However, the wife didn't know about this specific boundary before the incident. The husband hadn't mentioned it before, so maybe she didn't realize it would be an issue. But now that he's brought it up, is he justified in his request?\n\nSome might argue that the husband is overstepping because it's her personal item and her history. Others might say that once in a committed relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries, even if they weren't discussed beforehand. The key here is communication. The husband is trying to communicate his discomfort, and the wife is dismissing it as jealousy. If the husband isn't actually jealous but just uncomfortable with the stain, then it's a matter of respecting his feelings. However, if the wife is unwilling to compromise, that could be a problem.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. But if the husband is being honest about his feelings and the wife is not respecting them, then the husband isn't in the wrong for expressing his need. The real issue is whether the wife should honor his request even though she's attached to the dress. Since he's the one living in the house, too, and it's his comfort that's being affected, he has a valid point. The wife's attachment is personal, but the husband's request is about something in the shared space. So I think the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. It's about mutual respect and boundaries in the relationship.\n"
