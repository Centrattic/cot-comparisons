I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting the wife's prom dress with cum stains in their house. The situation is that the wife had a prom dress with stains from a past sexual encounter, and the husband finds out through a conversation with her friend. He tells her to get it dry cleaned, but she refuses and accuses him of being jealous.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's main issue isn't that she had sex with someone else, which he says he's not jealous about. Instead, he's uncomfortable with the physical presence of another person's bodily fluids in his home. The wife, on the other hand, sees the dress as a positive memory and doesn't want to get rid of it, even though she's known about the stains for a long time.\n\nThe key points here are the husband's boundaries versus the wife's feelings about her memories. The husband isn't upset about the past relationship but the current state of the dress. Since the wife was okay with keeping it all along, the husband's objection is a recent development. However, he has a right to his comfort in their shared space. The wife's reaction is to accuse him of jealousy, but he clarifies that it's not about jealousy. It's more about the physical presence of someone else's body fluids in their home.\n\nNow, considering social norms and etiquette, people often have different boundaries regarding personal items and memories. If the husband finds the presence of another person's bodily fluids in their home uncomfortable, that's a valid personal boundary. The wife, however, might prioritize her emotional attachment to the dress. The question is whether the husband overstepped by asking her to clean it when she's been keeping it that way for years.\n\nBut the husband's request isn't about destroying the memory; it's about cleaning it. The wife refuses, which makes the situation tense. The husband's action is about maintaining his comfort in their home, which is reasonable. The wife's refusal shows that she values her memory more than accommodating his discomfort. \n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, the husband isn't necessarily wrong for expressing his discomfort and setting a boundary. However, the wife is also not wrong for holding onto her memory. The conflict arises from differing values and boundaries. The husband's issue isn't with the past relationship but the current presence of the stain, which he finds unacceptable. Since he's the one living in the house, his request is about his living environment. The wife's decision to keep it, despite his request, could be seen as dismissive of his feelings.\n\nBut the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is the husband here. He's asking if he's in the wrong for not wanting the stained dress in his house. Given that he's communicated his discomfort and the wife is ignoring it, the husband isn't in the wrong for expressing his boundary. The wife's choice to keep it as a memory is her right, but the husband's right to his comfort in the home is also valid. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
