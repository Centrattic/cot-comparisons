I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote this (the husband) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's old prom dress with another guy's cum stains in their house. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The husband didn't care about her past sexual experiences before, but now he's upset about the physical evidence (the stains) being in their home. He wants it cleaned because he doesn't want another man's bodily fluids in his house. His wife, on the other hand, has good memories tied to the dress and doesn't want to get rid of those memories. She also says he's overreacting and being jealous, even though he says he's not jealous of her past.\n\nSo, from a relationship standpoint, the husband's reaction might be about his comfort and personal boundaries. It's not about jealousy per se, but about the presence of something he finds distasteful. However, the wife's argument is about her right to keep her personal items and memories. \n\nLegally, the husband owns the house, but the wife owns the dress. So he might not have the legal right to demand she gets it cleaned unless it's a health hazard. Morally, it's more about mutual respect. The husband is expressing his discomfort, which is valid for him, but the wife is also within her rights to keep the dress. \n\nThe key here is communication. The husband has expressed his feelings, but the wife is not budging. It's possible that the husband is overstepping if he's trying to control her personal items, but he's also expressing a valid personal boundary. However, since the dress is in their shared home, there might be a middle ground, like storing it elsewhere or both compromising. \n\nBut according to the story, the husband has tried talking to her again, and she refuses. So if he's not being jealous but just uncomfortable with the physical presence of another man's stains, he's within his right to feel that way. However, if he's trying to control her personal items and memories, that could be an issue. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, people might side with the husband because it's gross to have another person's bodily fluids in the home. Others might side with the wife because it's her memory and she's allowed to keep it. \n\nI think the husband is not in the wrong because he's stating his personal boundaries. However, he could be in the wrong if he's being controlling. But since the main issue is his discomfort with bodily fluids, not controlling her past, he might not be wrong. But the wife is also not wrong in keeping her dress. The problem is mutual respect and compromise. Since the husband is asking for cleaning rather than removing the dress, maybe he's in the right. But if the wife doesn't want to comply, it's her choice. \n\nHmm. Maybe the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's expressing a personal boundary, even if the wife is not respecting his wishes. The husband isn't being jealous but is asking for something that's in his home. However, the dress is hers, so he can't force her to clean it. So perhaps he's not wrong in expressing his feelings, but he can't enforce it if she doesn't agree. So the answer might be B.\n"
