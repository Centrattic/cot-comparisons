I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author's wife has a prom dress that's been in her closet for a long time. The wife showed it to a friend, and mentioned that her date \"made a mess,\" implying there's cum stains on it. The author then expresses discomfort about having another man's bodily fluids in their home and asks to have it cleaned. The wife refuses, saying the author is overreacting and that she has good memories associated with the dress.\n\nFirst, I should consider the author's perspective. He's not jealous of her past partners, but the presence of someone else's bodily fluids in their home is a hygiene and personal comfort issue. It's a valid concern from a health standpoint, as bodily fluids can carry diseases, even if they're old. Plus, having a physical artifact of her ex's intimate behavior might make him uncomfortable, which is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's side is about her memories and the significance of the dress. She might see it as a personal memento and feel that her partner has no right to tell her how to handle her own items. She might also feel that the author is being overly controlling or jealous under the guise of cleanliness.\n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. If he's expressing a legitimate concern about health and cleanliness, then he's not necessarily in the wrong. However, if his reaction is more about jealousy or possessiveness rather than actual health risks, then maybe he could be in the wrong. The author himself states that he's not jealous of her past partners, which suggests his discomfort is about the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids, not the emotional aspect.\n\nThe line between personal discomfort and being overbearing is thin. If the author is insisting on cleaning it without respecting her memories, that could be an issue. But he's asking her to clean it for health reasons, which is a reasonable request. The wife refusing might be dismissive of his valid concerns.\n\nI think the author's main issue is about maintaining a clean and safe home environment. Unless there's a direct health risk, it's more about personal boundaries. However, bodily fluids can be a legitimate health concern, especially if not properly cleaned. The wife's refusal to clean it despite this might be where she's in the wrong. But the author's approach could also be seen as overstepping if he's being controlling. However, since he's stating health concerns, he's probably justified.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
