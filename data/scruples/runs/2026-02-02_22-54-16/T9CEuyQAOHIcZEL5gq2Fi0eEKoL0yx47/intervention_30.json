I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband not wanting his wife's prom dress with another man's cum stains in their house.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband says he's not jealous about her past but now he's upset about the dress. The wife has had the dress in the closet for a long time, and the husband never cared before. The issue came up when the friend visited and the wife mentioned the stains, which led to the husband's reaction.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries in a relationship. Even if the husband isn't jealous in general, the presence of another man's bodily fluids might cross a personal boundary for him. The wife, on the other hand, feels the dress has sentimental value and doesn't want to clean it. \n\nI need to consider if the husband is overstepping. Since the dress is in their home, the husband's discomfort is valid. But the wife has a right to her own memories and items unless there's a mutual agreement about such things. The husband's request is about removing something from the house, which is a reasonable boundary. However, the wife's refusal is also about her personal history and memories, which is understandable.\n\nThe husband's initial reaction might seem sudden, but he's stating his discomfort now. The wife's argument is about past experiences and memories, which are important to her. The question is whether the husband is in the wrong for making this request. \n\nIn many relationships, couples discuss boundaries about past items. If this wasn't a topic they had discussed before, the husband's sudden objection might come off as overreacting. However, his feelings are valid. It's a matter of mutual respect and communication. The wife not cleaning it is her choice, but the husband's discomfort is also valid. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the husband's request is reasonable. Since he's not trying to control her past but is uncomfortable with the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their shared space, he might not be in the wrong. However, the wife's right to keep her memories is also valid. \n\nIn AITA terms, the husband is not being unreasonable in setting a boundary, so he's not in the wrong. The correct answer would be B.\n"
