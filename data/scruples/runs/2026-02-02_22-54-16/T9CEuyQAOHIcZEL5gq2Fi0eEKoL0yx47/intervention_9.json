I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a wife who has a prom dress with cum stains from a past prom night. The husband is upset about it and wants it cleaned, but the wife refuses, saying he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's main issue isn't that she had sex with someone else in the past\u2014it's the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. He's not jealous of her past, just uncomfortable with the actual physical traces of it. On the other hand, the wife has positive memories associated with the dress and doesn't see a problem with keeping it as a memento. She might view the husband's request as unnecessary or even controlling.\n\nLegally, there's no law against keeping a prom dress with stains, so the husband can't force her to clean it unless there's some health issue, which isn't mentioned here. Emotionally, the husband's discomfort is valid. Even if he's not jealous, the idea of another person's bodily fluids in their home might be a personal boundary he's setting. The wife's right to keep her memories is also valid. But in a relationship, partners often have to negotiate such things. The husband is asking for something that affects their shared living space, so he's not entirely out of line. However, maybe there's a middle ground, like the wife keeping the dress in a different location or covering it up.\n\nThe key points are mutual respect and communication. The author (husband) is communicating his discomfort and asking for a reasonable request\u2014cleaning a potentially unsanitary item from the home. The wife is resisting because of emotional attachment. Neither is entirely wrong, but the husband's request is about a personal boundary in their shared space, which should be considered. However, the wife's right to her memories is also important. The husband isn't being unreasonable, but he might need to understand that the dress is a cherished memory for her. Still, his request is about their home's cleanliness, which is a valid concern.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Probably not. He's expressing a boundary, and the wife is not respecting his wishes. But maybe the husband could have approached it more sensitively. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether the approach was perfect. Since he's not violating any laws or ethical standards, and he's communicating his feelings, I think the answer is B (he's not in the wrong).\n"
