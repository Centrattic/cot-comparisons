I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who's upset about his wife's prom dress having cum stains from a past partner. They've been married for a long time, and the husband only recently brought it up after his wife mentioned the stains in front of a friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband isn't jealous of her past relationships but is now disturbed by the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. His main issue seems to be about cleanliness and comfort rather than jealousy. The wife, on the other hand, values the dress as a memory and refuses to clean it, even after he expresses discomfort.\n\nNow, legally, there's no right or wrong here. Emotionally, it's about mutual respect and communication. The husband had the right to express his feelings once he felt uncomfortable. However, the wife might feel that her memories are important and that her husband is overreacting. The key is whether the husband's request is reasonable. He's not asking her to forget the past but to clean something that makes him uneasy in their shared home. \n\nThe wife's refusal could be seen as dismissive of his feelings, but she's also within her rights to hold onto sentimental items. The problem arises when communication breaks down. The husband brought it up calmly, and the wife's response was to accuse him of jealousy, which might not be fair if his issue is about cleanliness, not her past. However, the husband might not have addressed this issue earlier, which could be a point of contention.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to compromise. If the husband's discomfort is valid, the wife might need to consider his feelings. Conversely, if the dress is a significant memory for her, the husband might need to respect that. Since the husband's main issue is the physical presence of the stains, and not the fact that she had sex before, his stance could be seen as reasonable. The wife's refusal to clean it despite his repeated requests might make her the one in the wrong. But it's a nuanced situation where both could have handled it better. However, the question is if the husband is in the wrong. Since he's expressing a valid concern about his home and comfort, and the wife isn't compromising, the answer might lean towards him not being in the wrong. But I need to check if there's any cultural or social context I'm missing. In some views, bodily fluids in the home are unsanitary, so his request is about health and cleanliness. The wife's refusal could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the husband isn't in the wrong for wanting it cleaned, so answer B.\n"
