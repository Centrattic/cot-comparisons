I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who doesn't want his wife's prom dress, which has cum stains from a previous partner, in their house. The wife is upset and says he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The husband isn't jealous of her past partners, which is a good point. But the issue is about the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. The wife found it funny and made a joke about it, showing the dress to her friend, which the husband found uncomfortable. He asked her to get it cleaned, but she refuses, saying it's her memory and he should stop being jealous.\n\nNow, considering the moral or social norms here. In many relationships, partners might have different boundaries. The husband's discomfort is about the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their shared home. Even if he's not jealous of her past, the idea of another person's bodily fluids in their living space can be a valid concern. On the other hand, the wife sees it as a memory and is upset that her husband is making a big deal out of it. \n\nIs the husband overreacting? Well, bodily fluids from a previous partner can be a health concern, though maybe in this case, after so many years, it's not a current health risk. But the emotional aspect is about mutual respect and boundaries. The wife might think it's her right to keep the dress, while the husband feels his comfort is important. \n\nThe key here is whether the husband's request is reasonable. He's not asking her to delete memories or be faithful, just to remove something that makes him uncomfortable. The wife, however, is refusing, which could be seen as dismissing his feelings. \n\nIn many cases, relationships require compromise. If the husband is making a reasonable request and the wife is refusing without considering his feelings, that could make her the asshole. Conversely, if the husband is being overly controlling about a situation that's not harmful, he might be the one in the wrong. \n\nBut in this case, the husband is expressing discomfort about another man's bodily fluids in their home. That's a personal boundary. The wife's refusal to clean it, despite knowing it bothers him, could be seen as not respecting his feelings. However, the husband might need to consider if his request is about jealousy or just the physical presence. Since he states he isn't jealous, it's more about the stain itself. \n\nSo, is he wrong? If the husband is being reasonable in his request and the wife isn't respecting his wishes, then maybe the wife is the one being unreasonable. But if the husband's request is overstepping, like controlling her personal items, then he could be wrong. \n\nThe line here is about mutual respect. The husband's request is to clean the dress, which is a reasonable action to remove something that makes him uncomfortable. The wife's refusal might be because she values the memory, but she's not respecting his feelings by not complying. \n\nTherefore, the husband might not be in the wrong. He's asking for something that's within their shared home's cleanliness and personal comfort. The wife's response dismisses his feelings, which could make her the one at fault. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
