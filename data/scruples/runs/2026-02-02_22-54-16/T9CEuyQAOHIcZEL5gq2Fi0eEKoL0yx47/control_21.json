I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is upset about their wife's prom dress having cum stains from a past partner and wants it cleaned. The wife doesn't want to and says the author is being jealous.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author isn't jealous about the past relationship itself but about the physical reminder (the dress) being in the house. The wife has had the dress for a long time, and the author only became aware of the stains after a conversation with her friend. The author's main issue is the presence of another man's bodily fluid in their home, not the fact that the wife had sex before. The wife is defensive and insists on keeping the dress as it has good memories.\n\nNow, thinking about societal norms and personal boundaries. In a marriage, respecting each other's boundaries is crucial. The author's discomfort is valid because they are married and in a committed relationship. The presence of another man's cum in the house could be a hygiene and emotional issue. However, the wife sees it as a personal memory and isn't willing to remove it, which might be her right. \n\nBut the author's request is reasonable. They are asking for the dress to be cleaned, not to get rid of it. The wife's refusal might stem from attachment to her past, but the author has the right to their own comfort in their shared home. Jealousy might be a red herring here; the author is more concerned about the physical presence of someone else's bodily fluids than the act itself. \n\nHowever, the wife's reaction could indicate that she feels her personal history is being policed. The question is whether the author's request is reasonable. Since the author is married and in a committed relationship, they might have the right to ask for things that affect the household environment. On the other hand, the wife's right to personal memories and past experiences is also valid. \n\nBut in this case, the author is not asking to destroy the dress or prevent the wife from having those memories. They just want it cleaned for hygiene reasons. The wife's refusal could be seen as unreasonable if the author's comfort is a valid concern. However, the wife might feel that the author is being overly controlling or jealous, even if that's not the intention. \n\nConsidering all this, it's a bit of a gray area. But I think the author is within their rights to want the dress cleaned for hygiene and personal comfort. The wife's attachment might be valid, but the author's request is about the home they share. So the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong), but there's a nuance here. If the author's reaction is more about control or jealousy, it could shift to A. But based on the given info, the author seems to be focused on the physical aspect, not the emotional jealousy, so B makes sense.\n"
