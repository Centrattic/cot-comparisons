I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband objecting to his wife keeping a prom dress that has cum stains from a past relationship. The wife is keeping it because of good memories, and the husband wants it cleaned because he doesn't want another man's bodily fluids in their home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The husband mentions he's not jealous about her past partners, so his issue isn't with her history. The problem is specifically with the physical presence of another man's cum in their house. From his perspective, it's about comfort and boundaries. He wants to be free from that discomfort. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife is attached to the dress because of the memories. She might see it as a personal connection to her past and not something that should be removed. The question is whether his request is reasonable or if he's overstepping.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I should consider if there's a cultural or social norm that dictates this. In many relationships, partners have different comfort levels about each other's past. The husband's request is about his own comfort, which is valid. However, the wife's right to keep personal items with sentimental value is also important. \n\nHe's not objecting to her past relationships but specifically to the physical traces of them. That's a boundary he's setting. If she doesn't clean it, he's not forcing her, but he's expressing his discomfort. The key is whether his feelings are valid. Since he's not jealous but just uncomfortable, that's his personal choice. The wife's refusal to clean it could be seen as her right to keep her memories, but the husband's request is about their shared living space. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's more about personal boundaries. He's making a reasonable request for his own comfort. The wife's reaction might be dismissive, but the husband isn't wrong in wanting to remove something that makes him uncomfortable. So, the answer would be B (No) because he's not in the wrong. They just need to communicate better and find a compromise, but he isn't wrong for expressing his feelings.\n"
