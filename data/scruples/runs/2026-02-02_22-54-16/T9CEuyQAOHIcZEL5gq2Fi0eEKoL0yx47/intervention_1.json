I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's prom dress with another man's cum stains in their house. The author states he's not jealous of her past but now is upset about the physical presence of those stains.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife had the dress for a long time, and the author never noticed until a friend commented on the stains. The wife's mention of the incident was casual, and the author felt uncomfortable after the fact. \n\nEmotionally, the author might feel violated by the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home, even though he's not jealous otherwise. On the other hand, the wife values the dress as a memory from her past. She didn't think it was an issue before, so the sudden objection might make her feel disrespected or accused.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author could have approached the situation with more sensitivity, discussing his feelings without making it seem like an accusation. However, the wife's refusal to clean the dress despite his discomfort could be seen as dismissive of his feelings. \n\nLegally, there's no wrongdoing here. It's a personal and moral issue. Socially, opinions might vary. Some might side with the author for wanting to remove a potentially unsanitary item, while others might support the wife's right to keep her memories. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's more about mutual respect and compromise. The author isn't in the wrong for expressing his discomfort, but he could have handled it more delicately. The wife isn't wrong for wanting to keep her memories but dismissing his feelings isn't helpful. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but both could work on communication.\n"
