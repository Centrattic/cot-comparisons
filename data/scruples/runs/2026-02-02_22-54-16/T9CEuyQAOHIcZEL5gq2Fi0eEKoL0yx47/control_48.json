I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a wife's prom dress that has cum stains from a past partner, and the husband is upset about it. They've been married for a while, and he's not jealous about her past, but this specific thing with the dress is bothering him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's main issue isn't with her past relationships but with the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. He's asking her to clean it, which she refuses, saying he's being jealous. She seems to think the memories are important and that he's overreacting.\n\nFrom a general perspective, it's about boundaries in a relationship. Even if he's not typically jealous, he has a right to feel uncomfortable about having another person's bodily fluids in their home. However, she has a right to keep personal mementos from her past. The question is whether his request is reasonable.\n\nSome might argue that the stain is an old memory and not a current issue, so he shouldn't be upset. Others might say that once married, both partners should respect each other's boundaries and preferences. The husband is expressing discomfort, and the wife is dismissing his feelings as jealousy. That could be a problem because it's not about jealousy but about a specific hygiene or comfort issue.\n\nI should also think about the fact that they've been married for a long time, and this is a new issue. He might not have noticed the stains before, which could be a point in his favor. But on the other hand, the wife might feel that her past experiences are her own, and the husband is overstepping by making her clean something that has sentimental value.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The husband brought it up, and the wife didn't take it seriously, which led to awkwardness. Maybe the issue is more about how they're handling the disagreement rather than the content itself. But the core of the problem is whether he's justified in his feelings.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some people might find it odd to keep a prom dress with such stains, but others would respect the emotional value. The husband's request is about cleanliness and his personal boundaries. It's possible that he's not wrong to feel that way, but the wife is also entitled to her feelings about the dress.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the husband isn't in the wrong for expressing his discomfort and asking her to clean the dress. However, the wife's refusal and dismissal of his feelings might be problematic. But the main question is about the husband's actions. Since he's not trying to control her past but is setting a boundary in their current life together, he's probably not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
