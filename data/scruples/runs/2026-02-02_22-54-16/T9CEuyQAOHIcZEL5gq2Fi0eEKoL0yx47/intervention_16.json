I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation where he's upset about his wife's prom dress having another man's cum stains. Hmm. First, I need to understand the scenario clearly.\n\nSo, the wife has had the dress in her closet for a long time. The author wasn't bothered before. The issue arises after she shows the dress to her friend, mentions the stains, and makes a joke about it. The author then confronts her about wanting it cleaned. The wife refuses, saying he's being jealous.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to consider both perspectives. From the author's side, he's not jealous about her past but is uncomfortable with another man's bodily fluids in their home. That's a reasonable concern for some people. It's about personal boundaries and disgust. From the wife's side, she's defending her memories and thinks he's overreacting. She's not doing anything wrong by keeping the dress, but maybe she didn't consider his feelings until he mentioned it.\n\nIs the author overstepping? Well, he didn't care before, and now he does. Maybe his feelings are valid too. Jealousy might not be the right term here; it's more about disgust or discomfort. The problem is whether he has the right to demand she clean or remove it. Since it's her dress, she has the right to keep it, but he has the right to his comfort. However, if they're in a shared home, maybe he's within his rights to request it's cleaned for his own peace of mind. But she's refusing, which is her choice. So neither is entirely at fault. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe key points: He didn't bring it up before, he's not jealous of her past, he's just uncomfortable with the stains. She's keeping a personal item with memories. His request is reasonable but she's not obligated to comply. Maybe he's not in the wrong for expressing his discomfort, but she's also not wrong for not cleaning it. The issue is their differing perspectives. Since the user wants a A or B answer, and the question is about the author's fault. If the answer is B (not in the wrong), then maybe that's the case. Because he's stating his boundaries, which is valid. But some might argue he's being overly possessive. But since he's not jealous of her past, it's more about his current comfort. So I think B is the correct answer here.\n"
