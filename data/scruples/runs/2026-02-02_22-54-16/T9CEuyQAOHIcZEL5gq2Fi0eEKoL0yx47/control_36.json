I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a man not wanting his wife's prom dress stained with another guy's cum in their house. The wife is keeping the dress and not cleaning it. The man feels uncomfortable, but the wife says he's being jealous and overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's main issue isn't the fact that his wife had sex before, which he says he's not jealous of. His problem is specifically with the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. He's requesting she clean it, but she refuses. The wife sees it as part of her memories and isn't willing to comply, even after the incident was brought up again.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, boundaries are important. The husband is expressing his discomfort, which is valid. Even if he's not jealous of her past, the presence of another man's cum in their home might be a personal boundary he's unwilling to cross. On the other hand, the wife feels that her memories are her own, and she's not in the wrong for keeping the dress with those memories. She might also feel that her past isn't something he should have control over.\n\nBut the key here is whether the husband is overstepping. He's asking her to clean the dress, not to throw it away or change her behavior. It's about maintaining cleanliness in their shared home. The wife's refusal to clean it might be seen as dismissive of his feelings. However, she might not see it as a big deal because she's not in a relationship with that other person anymore, and the stain is part of her history.\n\nAnother angle is consent and mutual respect. The husband didn't have a problem with the dress before the incident. The issue arose after the friend's comment. It's possible he's overreacting because the dress was there for a long time. But he's allowed to voice his discomfort now that he's aware of the stains. The wife's response of \"don't be jealous\" might be invalidating his feelings. He's not jealous of her past but is concerned about something physical in their home.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might say it's reasonable to want a clean home, while others might prioritize personal memories. The wife's stance is about her right to keep her mementos, and the husband's is about his comfort in their shared space. There's no clear right or wrong, but the husband is within his rights to express his discomfort and request cleaning, which the wife is refusing, possibly out of stubbornness or not seeing his perspective.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? If he's not trying to control her past but is asking for something that affects their shared living space, he might not be in the wrong. However, if the dress isn't causing any health issues, maybe the issue is more about his personal discomfort. But in a relationship, partners should consider each other's feelings. The wife might need to compromise by cleaning the dress if it's a big issue for him. If she refuses, maybe she's not respecting his boundaries. So the husband isn't entirely wrong, but the wife might not be either. However, the question is if the author (husband) is in the wrong. Since he's stating his boundaries, and the wife is not, the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong). But maybe there's nuance. Alternatively, if the husband is being overly controlling, then A. But the key is he's not asking for her to erase her past, just to clean the dress. So B makes sense.\n"
