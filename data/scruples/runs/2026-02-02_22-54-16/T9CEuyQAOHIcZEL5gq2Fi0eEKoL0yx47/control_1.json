I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a wife's prom dress with cum stains that her husband found out about and wants cleaned. The husband says he's not jealous about her past but doesn't want another guy's bodily fluids in his house. The wife is upset and says he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband isn't objecting to her past relationships but the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. He wants it removed, but the wife values the memories associated with the dress. \n\nLegally, there's no issue here. It's about personal discomfort. Emotionally, though, the husband feels uncomfortable. Is his reaction reasonable? Some might say yes; others might think he's overreacting. Jealousy isn't the issue here, as he states he's not jealous. The problem is the physical presence of something he finds unpleasant.\n\nThe wife's argument is about her memories and the fact that he didn't mind before. However, the husband's current discomfort is valid. The question is whether his stance is unreasonable. Since he's not violating any laws or moral codes, just expressing a personal preference, it's a matter of differing perspectives. The wife's refusal to clean it might be seen as dismissing his feelings, but he's not in the wrong for wanting it gone. His request is about personal space and comfort. So, the answer would likely be B (No), he's not in the wrong. But I need to make sure there's no cultural or social norms being violated. In many cultures, bodily fluids are a taboo in shared spaces, so his request is understandable. Hence, B is correct.\n"
