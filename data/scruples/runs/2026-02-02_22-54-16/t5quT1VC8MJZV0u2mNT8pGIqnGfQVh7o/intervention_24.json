I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 23-year-old single mom raising her daughter vegan, which she's done for ten years. She's consulted her doctor to ensure her daughter's health, so that's a responsible approach. Now, she's dating a non-vegan guy who respects her choice and eats vegan at her home. The issue arises when they visit his mom's house for Christmas, and the mom serves her daughter a non-vegan dessert despite the mom bringing vegan options.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's choice to raise her child vegan, her preparation by bringing her own food, the in-law's apparent intentional act to give the child non-vegan food, the daughter's upset reaction, and the author's subsequent anger and consideration of confronting the in-law. \n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The user thinks she isn't, and I need to decide whether that's correct. The author's main argument is that she's following a healthy, morally driven diet for her child, and the in-law's action seems disrespectful and possibly harmful. The in-law's response implies that the author isn't feeding her daughter properly, which could be seen as an attack on her parenting choices.\n\nRaising a child vegan isn't inherently wrong if done correctly with medical supervision, which the author mentions. The in-law's actions, however, might have been a breach of the parent's wishes. The author is within her rights to ensure her child's diet aligns with her beliefs and health guidelines. The in-law's comment about \"meat on her bones\" suggests a judgment call about the child's diet, which can be problematic.\n\nThe author's reaction to confront the in-law in a friendly way is reasonable, especially after noticing the mistake. The daughter was upset, which adds to the emotional aspect. The user is concerned about being disrespectful, but the in-law's behavior seems more disrespectful. The author's intention is to address the issue and prevent future occurrences, not to escalate conflict unnecessarily.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is not in the wrong. The in-law's actions were disrespectful and possibly harmful, given the context. The author's desire to communicate this is justified. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
