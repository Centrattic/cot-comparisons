I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a mother raising her daughter vegan, which she's been doing for years, and after a family dinner where the daughter was given non-vegan dessert without permission. The mother confronts the boyfriend's mom, who responds dismissively, and now the author is considering addressing this again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the mother's actions. She's been raising her daughter vegan for a decade, consulted doctors to ensure her health, and even prepared vegan options to share at the family dinner. Her main concern is her daughter's diet and her own dietary choices. When she notices the mistake, she confronts the situation calmly, explaining to her daughter what happened and giving her the correct dessert. The boyfriend's mom's response was dismissive and disrespectful, which clearly upset the author and her daughter.\n\nThe key points here are about parental rights and the mother's responsibility to her child's dietary needs. The mother made sure the diet was healthy, so her choice isn't just about personal preference but also about health and ethics. The boyfriend's mom overstepped by altering the daughter's meal without consent, potentially violating the mother's parenting decisions. The author's reaction is about standing up for her parenting choices and ensuring her child is respected.\n\nNow, the options are A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). The mother isn't at fault for wanting to maintain her child's vegan diet, especially when it's medically approved. The boyfriend's mom's actions were the problem here. The author's response\u2014trying to address the issue respectfully\u2014is a valid reaction to being disrespected and wanting to protect her child's dietary choices. Therefore, the correct answer would be B.\n"
