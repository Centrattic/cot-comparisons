I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a vegan mom raising her daughter that way for 10 years. She's a single mom and now in a new relationship. Her boyfriend's mom invited them to a family dinner, and the author brought vegan desserts. The mom ended up giving her daughter a non-vegan dessert, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, the author made sure her daughter's diet is healthy, as per the doctor's advice. So, from a health standpoint, she's being responsible. The mother's decision to raise her child vegan is a personal choice, and as long as it's nutritionally adequate, which the author says it is, then it's valid. \n\nWhen they went to the boyfriend's mom's house, the author was prepared. She brought her own food and desserts. The issue arose when the boyfriend's mom served non-vegan desserts to the author's daughter. The author approached the situation calmly, first checking if there was a mistake, then explaining to her daughter what happened. The boyfriend's mom's response was dismissive and even a bit rude, implying that the vegan diet isn't proper for a child. \n\nThe author's reaction is understandable. She felt disrespected and concerned about her daughter's beliefs and diet. The boyfriend's mom's actions could be seen as undermining the author's parenting choices. The daughter was also upset because she loves animals, so this incident might have affected her emotionally. \n\nThe author is considering addressing this with the boyfriend's mom again. Whether she should or not is another question, but the main point here is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe boyfriend's mom's actions seem to be the issue here. She didn't respect the dietary preferences and possibly the author's parenting decisions. The author was prepared and communicated her needs in advance. The fact that the mom-in-law went against the author's request and then made a comment about meat and the child's health suggests that she was the one being disrespectful.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She was just trying to ensure her daughter's diet and values were respected. The conflict came from the other party's lack of respect and possibly a disregard for the author's parenting choices. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
