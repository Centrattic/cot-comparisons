I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a single mom raising her daughter vegan. She's been vegan for a decade and made that choice for her daughter. They went to her boyfriend's mom's house for Christmas, and the mom ended up giving the daughter a non-vegan dessert despite the vegan ones being available. The author is upset because she felt disrespected and worried about her daughter's diet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The mom is a single parent who made a conscious decision about her child's diet, which she's discussed with her doctor. That's important because it shows she's taking her daughter's health into account. The boyfriend's mom, on the other hand, acted in a way that undermined that decision. She gave the daughter non-vegan food without consulting the mother, even though the author had brought vegan options. The mom's anger is justified because she's made an effort to accommodate her dietary choices and her daughter's, and the other person's actions were disrespectful and possibly harmful.\n\nBut wait, the boyfriend's mom might have thought she was doing something kind, like giving the child a treat. However, the problem is that the mother had a specific reason for the vegan diet, and the other mom didn't respect that. The author didn't do anything wrong by setting those boundaries. She even prepared in advance by bringing vegan food. The issue is on the other mom for not honoring the mother's wishes.\n\nAlso, the daughter was upset when she found out she ate non-vegan food, which the author had to explain. The boyfriend's mom's comment about \"real food\" and \"meat on her bones\" is dismissive and implies that the vegan diet isn't sufficient. That's a problem because it undermines the mother's parenting choices without valid reason.\n\nIs there any fault on the author's side? Maybe she could have been more proactive in supervising the dessert time, but considering the situation with other kids and a large family gathering, it's understandable that she couldn't watch every moment. The main issue is the other mom's actions and lack of respect.\n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. Her actions were appropriate in ensuring her daughter's diet, and the other mom overstepped her boundaries.\n"
