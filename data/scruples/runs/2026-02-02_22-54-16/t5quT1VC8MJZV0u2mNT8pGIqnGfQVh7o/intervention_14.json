I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a single mom who's raising her daughter vegan. She's been doing this for ten years, and she consults her doctor to make sure her daughter is healthy. Then, when visiting her boyfriend's mom's house for a dinner, there's a conflict. The mom brings vegan desserts, but the boyfriend's mom serves the non-vegan dessert to the daughter. The mom confronts her, and the mom-in-law dismisses her, saying things like \"real food\" and \"meat on her bones.\" Now the author is upset and considering confronting her again.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about the dietary choices and the actions taken. The mom is following her vegan lifestyle, which she's been doing for a long time and has medical supervision. She's also trying to instill certain morals in her daughter. The issue arises when her daughter is given non-vegan food without consent. \n\nThe author's actions: She brought her own food, made sure her daughter's diet is healthy, and was prepared. When she noticed the mistake, she tried to address it calmly. The mom-in-law's response was dismissive and disrespectful, which upset both the author and the daughter. \n\nFrom a legal and health perspective, parents have the right to make dietary choices for their children, especially if they're medically supervised. The mom isn't forcing the daughter to be vegan; she's providing a diet that she believes is appropriate. The mom-in-law overstepped by serving non-vegan food without permission, which could have health implications if the daughter has allergies or dietary restrictions. \n\nEmotionally, the author is justified in feeling disrespected. The mom-in-law's comments about \"real food\" and \"meat on her bones\" are judgmental and undermine the author's parenting choices. The fact that the daughter was upset because she loves animals adds another layer, as the mom was trying to align her values with her child's upbringing.\n\nHowever, one might argue that the author could have been more proactive in ensuring her daughter's food wasn't mixed up. But considering the situation\u2014many kids present, a busy dinner\u2014it's reasonable that she trusted the host to handle the food correctly, especially since she had communicated her needs in advance. The mom-in-law's actions were a breach of that trust.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The conflict stems from the mom-in-law's actions, not the author's. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
