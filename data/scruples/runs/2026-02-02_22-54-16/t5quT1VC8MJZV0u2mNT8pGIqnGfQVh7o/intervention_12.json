I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 23-year-old single mother raising her daughter vegan. The mom has been vegan for 10 years and consults her doctor to ensure her daughter's health. They went to her boyfriend's mom's house for Christmas, and the mom brought her own vegan desserts. The boyfriend's mom, however, gave the daughter the non-vegan dessert and made some comments about real food and meat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the mom's actions. She's following a vegan lifestyle, which she's done for a decade. She's also consulting a doctor to make sure her daughter is healthy on that diet. That shows she's taking responsibility for her child's nutrition. She prepared her own food and desserts, so she's trying to accommodate her daughter's diet in a non-vegan environment. The fact that she had already discussed bringing her own food suggests she made an effort to ensure her daughter's needs were met.\n\nNow, the boyfriend's mom's actions are problematic. She not only gave the non-vegan dessert but also made comments that undermined the mom's parenting choices. Saying things like \"real food\" and \"meat on her bones\" implies that the vegan diet is insufficient, which is a judgment on the mother's parenting. The mom then felt disrespected and upset, which is understandable given that her dietary choices were questioned.\n\nThe boyfriend's mom also shushed the daughter when she asked about the dessert, which could be seen as dismissive and not respecting the child's awareness of her diet. The daughter was up to her and upset, which adds emotional weight to the situation.\n\nFrom a legal and ethical standpoint, parents have the right to make decisions about their children's diets, especially if they're consulting healthcare professionals. The boyfriend's mom overstepped by making the choice to feed the child non-vegan food without the mother's consent. This could be seen as interfering in parental decisions. The mom's reaction\u2014being upset and wanting to address it\u2014is reasonable, as her child's dietary preferences (and the mother's parenting style) were disregarded.\n\nThe mom also considered bringing it up again, which is a valid response to being disrespected. The key points here are consent and respect. The boyfriend's mom didn't have the authority to alter the child's diet without the mother's approval. The mom's efforts to ensure her daughter's diet were being undermined, which is a breach of trust and respect.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) criteria, the mom isn't in the wrong here. The boyfriend's mom's actions were the issue, not the mom's. The mom acted in her child's best interest, following medical advice, and was prepared. The other party's actions were disrespectful and crossed boundaries.\n"
