I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a single mom raising her 5-year-old daughter on a vegan diet, which she's done for 10 years. She's consulting her doctor to ensure the diet is healthy. Then, when visiting her boyfriend's mom for a holiday meal, the mom serves the child non-vegan desserts despite the mother's efforts to provide vegan options. The daughter ends up eating the non-vegan dessert, and the boyfriend's mom makes comments about the vegan diet being inadequate.\n\nFirst, the key points: The mom is following a vegan diet based on her morals and has medical oversight, so from a health standpoint, she's doing her due diligence. The boyfriend's mom, without consulting the child's parent, serves non-vegan food, which contradicts the parent's decision. The mom was even prepared with her own desserts, and the daughter was upset about eating animal products. The boyfriend's mom's comments were dismissive and disrespectful, implying the vegan diet is wrong.\n\nThe main ethical question here is about parental rights versus the opinions of others. Parents have the right to make dietary choices for their children, especially when those choices are medically sound. The boyfriend's mom overstepped by not respecting the parent's decision and acting in a condescending manner. The mom's anger is justified because her dietary choice was not respected, and the child's preferences were considered (the daughter loves animals, so the mother's explanation about veganism aligns with that).\n\nThe boyfriend's mom's actions could be seen as undermining the parent's authority and making the parent feel disrespected. The question is whether the author should bring it up. The answer is likely that she's not in the wrong because her actions were to protect her child's diet, and the other party acted disrespectfully. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
