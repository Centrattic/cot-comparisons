I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the 23-year-old mom) is in the wrong after an incident at her boyfriend's mom's house where the kid ate non-vegan dessert. The options are A (Yes, she's in the wrong) or B (No, she's not). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The mom is vegan and has raised her daughter vegan for 5 years. She's a single mom, and her diet is supervised by a doctor to ensure her daughter's health. She's dating a non-vegan guy who respects her choice. They went to his mom's for a family dinner. She brought vegan desserts, but his mom served non-vegan ones to her daughter. The mom confronts the mother-in-law, who dismisses her concerns and makes comments about the diet. The mom is upset and considering addressing it again.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: \n\n1. **Health of the Child**: The mom is a single parent and has her daughter's health checked by a doctor. So, the vegan diet is medically approved. The mother-in-law's actions could be seen as undermining a medically supervised diet, which might be a concern.\n\n2. **Communication**: The mom had asked if they could bring their own food, which the mother-in-law allowed except for the vegetables. She was prepared, but the mother-in-law didn't serve the vegan dessert to her daughter. The mom confronted her calmly, but the mother-in-law responded disrespectfully.\n\n3. **Intent vs. Action**: The mother-in-law might have thought her actions were harmless, but they disregarded the daughter's dietary needs and the mom's parental authority. The mom's choice to raise her child vegan is a personal one, as long as it's healthy.\n\n4. **Respect and Boundaries**: The mother-in-law's comments about not knowing how to feed a child properly are disrespectful. The mom is justified in feeling disrespected. The daughter was also upset after learning she ate non-vegan items, which adds emotional impact.\n\n5. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: Parents have the right to make health and dietary decisions for their children unless it's harmful. Since the diet is medically approved, the mother-in-law overstepped by altering the child's food without consent.\n\n6. **Possible Misunderstandings**: The mother-in-law might have assumed the mom wasn't strict, but the mom had taken precautions (bringing her own food). The mother-in-law's actions were intentional, not accidental.\n\n7. **Conflict Resolution**: The mom addressed the issue calmly after the fact. If the mother-in-law continues to disrespect her parenting, it's reasonable to avoid future situations where this could happen.\n\nConsidering these points, the mother-in-law's actions were problematic. She disregarded a healthcare decision, disrespected the mom, and affected the child's well-being without consent. The mom is not in the wrong for standing up for her parenting choices. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
