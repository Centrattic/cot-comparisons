I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person (the author) is in the wrong in this situation. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author is a 23-year-old single mom who's been vegan for ten years. She's raising her five-year-old daughter vegan, consulting her doctor to ensure the diet is healthy. That part seems responsible; she's taking medical advice, so she's not neglecting her child's nutrition. \n\nShe's dating a guy who's not vegan but respects her choice and eats vegan at her home. That's good, but now they went to his mom's house for Christmas. The author prepared vegan food for herself and her daughter and even brought vegan desserts. She mentioned that the mom wanted her to bring her own food except for the veggies, so she was prepared. \n\nWhen they got there, the kids started playing. After dinner, the author noticed her daughter eating a non-vegan dessert. She confronted the boyfriend's mom, who dismissed her concerns and even said things like \"meat on her bones\" and that the author doesn't know how to feed a child. The daughter was upset because she loves animals, so the author had to explain she got the wrong dessert. \n\nNow the author is considering confronting the mother-in-law again or just avoiding eating with her. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nLet me think. The author's main issue is that her daughter's dietary restrictions were ignored, possibly intentionally. The mother-in-law didn't cut the vegan dessert first and gave the non-vegan one instead. The author feels this was a deliberate act of disrespect, undermining her parenting and the child's diet. \n\nIs the author wrong for wanting to address this? Well, the mother-in-law's actions led the daughter to eat non-vegan food without the mother's consent. The mother had taken precautions to bring vegan food. The mother-in-law's comments were condescending and disrespectful. The author is standing up for her parenting choice. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, as a parent, ensuring the child's dietary needs are met is a priority. The mother-in-law overstepped by not respecting that. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the situation, especially since her daughter was upset and the mother-in-law was dismissive. \n\nBut maybe there's a nuance. Did the author handle it the right way? She confronted her calmly, explained the mistake, and ensured her daughter had the right dessert. The mom-in-law's behavior was rude, but the author's response was measured. The key issue is the mother-in-law's disregard for the child's diet and the mother's wishes. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
