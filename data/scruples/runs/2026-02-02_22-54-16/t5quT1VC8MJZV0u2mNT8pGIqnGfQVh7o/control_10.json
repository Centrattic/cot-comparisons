I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The main situation is about the author, a single mom raising her daughter vegan, and a conflict that arose at her boyfriend's mom's house during a family gathering. The key points to consider are:\n\n1. **Raising a child vegan**: The author has been vegan for 10 years and is raising her daughter similarly. She consults her doctor to ensure the diet is healthy. Legally and medically, as long as the child is getting proper nutrition, it's a personal choice. There's no indication here that the diet is harmful.\n\n2. **The incident at her boyfriend's mom's house**: The author prepared vegan desserts but her daughter ended up eating non-vegan ones. The mother-in-law dismissed the dietary choice, implying it's not proper, and the daughter was upset. The author felt disrespected, both as a parent and as a person.\n\n3. **Intentions and actions**: The author made her dietary needs clear in advance, brought her own food, and even offered vegan desserts to the others. The mother-in-law's actions seemed to disregard the child's dietary restrictions, possibly intentionally. The mother-in-law's comment about \"real food\" and \"meat on her bones\" suggests a judgmental attitude towards the vegan lifestyle.\n\n4. **Possible wrongdoings**: The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The mother-in-law's actions directly violated the dietary rules the author set for her child. The author's reaction\u2014being upset and wanting to address the issue\u2014is a response to a breach of trust and respect. The mother-in-law's behavior was disrespectful and dismissive.\n\n5. **Context of the relationship**: The author mentions that her boyfriend's mom already disapproves of her. This incident might have been part of a pattern of disapproval, which the author is trying to address. The daughter was also affected emotionally when she realized she ate non-vegan food.\n\nConsidering all this, the mother-in-law is the one acting inappropriately by not respecting the dietary needs of the child and the author's parenting choices. The author is justified in feeling disrespected and wanting to address the issue. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
