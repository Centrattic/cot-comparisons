I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves a single mom raising her daughter vegan, which she's done for ten years and confirmed with her doctor. She's in a new relationship with a guy who's not vegan but respects her choice. They went to his mom's house for a holiday dinner. The mom had prepared vegan desserts, but the boyfriend's mother served her daughter non-vegan food instead. The author confronts her, gets a rude response, and now is upset about being disrespected.\n\nFirst, the author is following a vegan diet based on her morals and health considerations, and she's ensuring her daughter is healthy with medical check-ups. That's her right as a parent. The issue here is the grandmother serving meat-based food to the child without the mother's consent. The mother's concern isn't just about diet but about her parenting choices being undermined and her daughter's feelings about animal welfare. \n\nThe boyfriend's mom's actions seem dismissive and disrespectful. She made a comment about the child needing \"meat on her bones,\" which implies she doesn't take the vegan diet seriously. Also, she didn't respect the mother's effort to provide vegan desserts. The daughter was upset because she loves animals, so the grandmother's actions went against the mother's values and caused emotional distress. \n\nThe mother's response after the incident was to confront the grandmother in a calm manner, correct the mistake, and then later consider addressing it again. The question is whether the mother is in the wrong for bringing it up. From a parenting perspective, ensuring the child's dietary needs and values are respected is crucial. The grandmother overstepped by serving non-vegan food without consent and making derogatory remarks. \n\nThe key points here are consent, respect for parenting decisions, and the health and emotional well-being of the child. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the disrespect and protect her daughter's dietary choices. The grandmother's actions were inappropriate, so the mother isn't wrong in feeling upset or considering confronting her again. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
