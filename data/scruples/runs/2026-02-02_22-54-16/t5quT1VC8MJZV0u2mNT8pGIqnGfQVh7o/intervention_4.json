I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she's a vegan mom raising her daughter that way. She's been vegan for ten years and it's important to her for moral reasons. She makes sure the diet is healthy with her doctor. Then she's dating someone whose mom isn't vegan. They went over for a dinner, and the mom's mom didn't serve the vegan desserts prepared by the author, gave her daughter non-vegan food instead. The author was upset because she felt disrespected and like her daughter was misled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author did anything wrong. The main points are her decision to raise her child vegan and then confronting her boyfriend's mom about the dessert incident. Let's break it down.\n\nRaising a child vegan: The author mentions consulting with a doctor to ensure the diet is healthy. That seems responsible. As long as the child is getting proper nutrition, it's a personal choice. There's no legal issue here unless the doctor says otherwise. So, she's taking steps to make sure it's okay, so she's not being negligent.\n\nThe dessert incident: The author brought her own vegan desserts. The mom-in-law served non-vegan food to the child without consulting. The author confronted her, but the mom made a comment about Christmas and the child's diet. The author then gave her daughter her own dessert. The author is upset because she felt her choice was undermined. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for confronting the mom-in-law? The mom-in-law's actions could be seen as overstepping, interfering in parenting decisions. The author has the right to make dietary choices for her child, especially if it's medically sound. The mom-in-law's comment about the child needing meat and how to feed them is dismissive and possibly harmful. The author's reaction seems justified as she's protecting her child's values and health. \n\nConfronting the mom-in-law again might be necessary to address the disrespect. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to stand up for herself and her parenting choices. The mom-in-law's behavior was problematic, not the author's. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
