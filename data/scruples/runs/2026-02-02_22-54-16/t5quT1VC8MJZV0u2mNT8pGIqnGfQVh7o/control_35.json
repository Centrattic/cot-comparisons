I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The main scenario is about a mom raising her kid vegan and then a conflict arises when visiting her boyfriend's mom. \n\nFirst, the mom is a single parent who's been vegan for 10 years. She's made sure her daughter's diet is healthy with the help of a doctor. That part seems responsible. She went to her boyfriend's mom's house for a holiday, brought vegan desserts for the kids, and was clear ahead of time. But when it came time for dessert, her daughter ended up eating non-vegan stuff. The mom confronted the boyfriend's mom, who responded dismissively, even mocking the vegan diet. The mom is upset, feels disrespected, and wants to address it.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Let's break it down. The mom chose a vegan diet for her daughter, which she's checked with a doctor. That shows she's prioritizing her daughter's health, which is usually a valid reason. However, there's a debate around whether a vegan diet is appropriate for children. Some might argue that it's okay if medically supervised, others might say it's more complex. But the story says the mom is ensuring health, so that's covered.\n\nThe conflict arises when the boyfriend's mom overrides the mom's choice. The mom had taken steps to prevent this by bringing her own food. The mother-in-law didn't follow through, potentially putting the child in a situation against the parent's wishes. That seems like a breach of trust. The mom was within her rights to ensure her daughter follows the diet she's chosen, especially if it's medically appropriate.\n\nThe boyfriend's mom's reaction was dismissive and rude. She didn't respect the mom's choices and even mocked the diet. That's disrespectful towards the parent and could be harmful if repeated. The mom's reaction is understandable, feeling disrespected and wanting to address it. She's not wrong for wanting to stand up for her parenting choices.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the mother-in-law didn't realize the importance of the diet? But the mom had communicated her needs in advance. The mother-in-law still didn't comply, which suggests a lack of respect. The mother's intent was to protect her daughter's diet, which is a valid concern. \n\nIs there any fault on the mom's part? If the vegan diet isn't the healthiest for a child, but the story says she's checked with doctors. So, she's not negligent. The mom isn't in the wrong for making that choice. The mother-in-law is the one who acted disrespectfully. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
