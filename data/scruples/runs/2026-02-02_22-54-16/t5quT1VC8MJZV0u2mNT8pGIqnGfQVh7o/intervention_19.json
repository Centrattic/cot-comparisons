I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old single mom raising her daughter vegan, and a conflict with her boyfriend's mom during a family dinner. The mom had prepared vegan desserts, but the boyfriend's mom gave her daughter a non-vegan dessert instead, which upset the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has been vegan for ten years and is following a vegan diet for her daughter, ensuring she's healthy with doctor's approval. That seems responsible. When visiting her boyfriend's mom, she brought her own vegan food and desserts, making it clear that she wanted to provide vegan options. The mom's mother served a non-vegan dessert, possibly intentionally, leading to the conflict. The author confronted her calmly, explained the mix-up, and gave her daughter the correct dessert. She's upset about the disrespect and the mother's comments about the diet.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main factors here are the mother's rights to raise her child how she sees fit, as long as it's healthy. Since the author consults with a doctor, the vegan diet is appropriate. The boyfriend's mom overstepped by replacing the daughter's dessert without permission, which is a breach of trust and parenting decisions. The author's reaction seems justified because she was standing up for her parenting choice. The boyfriend's mom made derogatory remarks implying the author's diet is inadequate, which is disrespectful. \n\nThe author's approach was to confront the issue calmly and then address her daughter's feelings appropriately. There's no indication she was aggressive or inappropriate. The boyfriend's mom's actions were the problem here. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
