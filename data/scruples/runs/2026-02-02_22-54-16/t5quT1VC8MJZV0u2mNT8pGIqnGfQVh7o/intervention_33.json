I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a single mom raising her daughter vegan, which she's been doing for ten years. She's making sure her daughter's diet is healthy as per her doctor. Now, she went to her boyfriend's mom's house for a family dinner. The mom had a lot of kids, including her daughter. The author brought vegan desserts, but the boyfriend's mom served non-vegan ones to the daughter. The author confronted her, got an argument, and now she's upset and considering addressing the mom again.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if the author is wrong. The key points are: raising a child vegan. Is that acceptable? There's debate around it. Some people argue that a vegan diet can be healthy for children if properly planned with medical supervision, which the author mentions she does. So, if she's consulting her doctor and ensuring her daughter is healthy, then she's taking the necessary steps. The author's choice isn't inherently wrong if it's safe and she's responsible.\n\nThe second part is the incident at the dinner. The author brought vegan desserts, but her daughter was given non-vegan ones. The boyfriend's mom justified it by saying it's Christmas and the kid should have \"real food.\" The author was upset because she believes in her ethical stance against animal products. The mom's actions seem dismissive and disrespectful. She didn't consider the author's dietary choices and even criticized her parenting. The author's reaction was to confront her, which is understandable given the situation.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is standing up for her values and her daughter's well-being. The mom-in-law crossed a line by serving non-vegan food without consent, especially when she was aware of the author's preferences. The author's anger is justified because it's about her child's health and ethical upbringing. The mom-in-law's comment about \"meat on her bones\" suggests she didn't take the author's choice seriously, which is disrespectful.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have been more vigilant in ensuring her daughter's food wasn't tampered with. But the author had already prepared her own food and desserts, and it's reasonable to trust that the host would respect that unless there was a mistake. The responsibility lies with the host to handle dietary restrictions properly, especially when it's pre-arranged.\n\nIn terms of the author's intent to address the mom-in-law again, that's a personal choice, but she's not in the wrong for wanting to protect her daughter's values and their lifestyle. The situation is more about the mom-in-law's behavior being problematic.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
