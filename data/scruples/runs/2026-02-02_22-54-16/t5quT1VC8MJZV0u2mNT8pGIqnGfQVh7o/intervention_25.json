I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 23-year-old single mom who's been raising her 5-year-old daughter vegan for ten years. She's made sure the diet is healthy with her doctor's guidance. Now, she's dating a guy who's respectful and eats vegan in her home. They went to his mom's house for Christmas dinner, and she brought vegan desserts. The mom noticed her daughter eating non-vegan dessert and confronted his mom, who then made a comment implying she's not feeding the kid properly and suggested giving her real food. The author is upset because she felt disrespected and wants to address it with her boyfriend's mom.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: she's been vegan for a long time, chose to raise her daughter that way, and consulted a doctor to ensure health. That seems responsible. The boyfriend's mom served non-vegan desserts without consent, possibly undermining the author's dietary choices. The author's reaction was to check on the situation and then calmly explain to her daughter after the fact. She's planning to address this with the mom again, which is understandable if she felt disrespected.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. The key points are about consent and respect for dietary choices. The author made her daughter's diet a priority and communicated that she wanted to bring her own food. The boyfriend's mom did serve non-vegan food without asking, which is a breach of that. The comment about \"real food\" and \"meat on her bones\" is dismissive and possibly harmful, suggesting the author's choice is inadequate. \n\nThe author's intention was to ensure her daughter's diet aligns with their family's values and health. The boyfriend's mom acted unilaterally, which could be seen as overstepping. The author's response after the fact seems measured, especially since she approached her daughter calmly. However, she's considering bringing it up again. \n\nPossible arguments against the author: maybe she should have been more hands-on to prevent the situation, or perhaps she took it too seriously. But given that the mom didn't consult her and made a judgmental comment, the author's desire to address it isn't unreasonable. Also, the daughter was upset about eating animal products, which the author had explained to her in a child-friendly way. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Her actions were responsible and respectful, and the boyfriend's mom was the one who acted disrespectfully. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
