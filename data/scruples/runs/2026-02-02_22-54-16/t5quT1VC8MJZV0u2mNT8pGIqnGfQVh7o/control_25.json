I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for raising her child vegan and the subsequent situation with her boyfriend's mom.\n\nFirst, the mother is a single parent who's been vegan for 10 years. She's been following a vegan diet for her daughter and consults a doctor to ensure it's healthy. That part seems responsible. She mentions she's making sure the diet is appropriate, which is good.\n\nThen, she has a boyfriend, and they went to his mom's house for a family dinner. The mom prepared vegan desserts but noticed her daughter eating non-vegan dessert. She confronted her boyfriend's mom, who made comments about the vegan diet and the importance of the child eating meat. The mom feels disrespected and upset about the situation.\n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Let's consider the key points. Legally, parents have the right to make dietary choices as long as they're not harmful. The mom is consulting a doctor, so the vegan diet is medically sound. The issue is the grandmother's actions and comments. The grandmother served non-vegan food to the child without consent, which could be seen as interfering in the parents' decisions. The mother's reaction is about her boundaries being crossed, not about the diet itself.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong for how she handled it. She prepared the vegan desserts, made them available, and tried to ensure her daughter's meal. When she noticed the problem, she addressed it calmly, even after the grandmother's rude comment. The mother is advocating for her child's dietary needs, which is her right. The grandmother overstepped by altering the meal without consent and making critical remarks.\n\nThe answer is B (No), because the mother isn't in the wrong. The main issue is the grandmother's actions and lack of respect for the parenting choices. The mother's response was appropriate to protect her child's diet and her own standing as a parent.\n"
