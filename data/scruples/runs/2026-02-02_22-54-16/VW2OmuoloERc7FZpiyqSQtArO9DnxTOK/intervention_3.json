Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author deciding against having a second child after their first son is diagnosed with autism and has various health issues. The key points here are the author's reasons for not wanting another child and their wife's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their son has autism, which is confirmed by a specialist. They also note the challenges they face, like poor sleep, health issues, and the potential for the child to face bullying. The author feels it's selfish to bring another child into such a difficult situation, even though they love their son. The wife, however, thinks the author is being selfish and spiteful.\n\nNow, considering autonomy and personal choice, individuals have the right to make decisions about their family size based on their circumstances. The author is expressing a personal decision based on their experiences and concerns for their family's well-being. It's important to note that having autism isn't a negative trait in itself, and the author's concerns might stem from the challenges they face rather than the condition itself. However, the author is making a judgment about a potential future child's quality of life based on their son's experiences, which could be seen as problematic because it assumes that any autistic child would have a similarly difficult life, which isn't necessarily true.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's decision is based on their current situation. They have valid concerns about their ability to cope with another child with similar needs, especially considering the existing challenges. The decision not to have more children is a personal one, and they are not forcing anyone else's hand. The wife's reaction adds another layer, but the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not the wife.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is not denying their son's worth or value. They still love him deeply. Their decision is about their own capacity and circumstances, not a condemnation of autism. However, there's a potential for ableism if they are implying that autistic children have a lower quality of life, which is a sensitive issue. But the post doesn't explicitly state that; it's more about the family's ability to handle another child's needs.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author is making a personal choice based on their family's specific situation. While there's a risk of ableist thinking, the primary issue is their personal decision-making process. Unless they are acting out of prejudice or harming others, it's a matter of personal choice. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, there's a nuance here because the decision could be seen as making assumptions about future children's lives. But without explicit ableism, it's more about their own circumstances.\n"
