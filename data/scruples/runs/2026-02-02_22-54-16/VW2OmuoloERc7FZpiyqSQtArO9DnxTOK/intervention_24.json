Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they found out their son has autism and they don't want to have a second child because they think another child might also have similar challenges. The author loves their son but is concerned about bringing another child into a potentially difficult life. The wife thinks the author is being selfish and spiteful, but the author feels the opposite.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. The author is making a personal decision based on their current experiences. They mention their son's autism, sleep issues, eczema, allergies, and the stress that comes with caring for him. The author's reasoning is that they don't want another child to have a hard life like their son. The wife disagrees, seeing it as selfish.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate if this is a case of the author being in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, people have the right to make choices about their family size based on their circumstances. However, there's a potential issue with the assumption that a future child would have the same or worse challenges. Autism is a spectrum, and while there might be genetic components, it's not a certainty that another child would have the same issues. The author might be overgeneralizing or making a decision based on fear rather than facts. \n\nBut then again, the author is coming from a place of love and concern for their existing child and the potential future child. They might be overwhelmed with their current situation and feel that adding another child could be too much. It's also important to note that the author is not making a judgment about autistic individuals but is concerned about the quality of life for a possible future child. However, the wife's perspective is that this is selfish because they had always wanted a second child. \n\nThe concept of \"ITA\" (I'm the Asshole) usually involves a moral judgment. The author is not blaming autism itself but is making a personal choice based on their values. They might be seen as prioritizing their own ability to cope rather than the potential for a future child. However, it's also a personal decision that others might view differently. \n\nIn many cases, the decision to have children is deeply personal and can be influenced by various factors, including health and well-being. The author is not making a harmful choice but is choosing based on their current understanding and experiences. The question is whether their reasoning is valid. Since autism is a part of their son's life and not a choice, the author's decision is based on real experiences, not hypotheticals. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think the author is not in the wrong. They are making a personal choice based on their situation, even if others might disagree. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
