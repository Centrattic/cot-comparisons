Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. Let me start by understanding the scenario.\n\nThe author found out their son has autism, which was diagnosed by a specialist. The son has multiple challenges: sleep issues, physical problems like eczema and allergies, and the author is worried that a second child might also have similar or worse issues. The wife wants another child, but the author doesn't, feeling it's selfish to bring another child into such a hard life. The author loves their son but is conflicted, and their wife thinks they're being selfish. The question is whether the author is the asshole (ATTA) here.\n\nFirst, consider the author's reasoning. They believe that bringing another child into a life with autism and its associated challenges is not fair. They see their son's struggles and don't want another child to go through the same. The author is making a decision based on their current experiences and wants to avoid potential suffering for another child. But is that selfish?\n\nOn the other hand, the author's wife thinks they're being selfish. The wife might feel that the author is making a judgment based on one child's experience and not considering the possibility that another child could be different. Also, autism is a spectrum, and not all autistic individuals have the same level of challenges. The author is projecting their son's specific issues onto a potential future child, which might not be accurate.\n\nAnother angle: the decision to have children is a personal one. The author is expressing their own feelings about the potential risks and challenges. However, the wife might feel that the decision to have a second child is mutual, and the author is undermining her wishes. This could lead to conflict in the relationship.\n\nEthically, is it wrong to not have another child because of the possibility of autism? Some might argue that the author is making a judgment about the value of life for someone with autism, which could be seen as ableism. Others might see it as a responsible decision based on their capacity to care for multiple children with special needs.\n\nThe author mentions that their son is a \"handful\" with physical and behavioral issues. They also note that the son can't sleep alone, leading to significant sleep deprivation for the parents. These factors could affect their ability to care for another child, especially if the second child has similar needs. However, the author should consider that each child is unique and that their son's specific struggles might not be replicated in another child.\n\nAdditionally, the author's concern about bullying and the child's social challenges is valid, but it's important to remember that societal attitudes and support systems can improve over time. The author's fear might be projecting current experiences onto the future without considering possible advancements.\n\nIn terms of selfishness, the author is prioritizing their own emotional and physical well-being, which is understandable. However, the decision to have a child is a major one that involves considerations beyond just the child's potential challenges. The author is also making a choice that affects their spouse's wishes and their future family dynamics.\n\nSo, putting this all together: the author's reasons are based on their current experiences, but they might be overgeneralizing. The ethical question here is whether it's selfish to avoid having another child due to potential disabilities. Some might say the author is being realistic about their ability to care for another child with similar needs, while others might argue that it's making a judgment about the worth of a life with autism. The spouse's perspective is also important, as it's a shared decision.\n\nI think the key points are whether the author is dismissing the potential for a future child to have a good life despite challenges, and whether their decision is based on fear or realistic resource allocation. The answer might hinge on whether the author's concerns are valid (like their ability to care for another child) versus making a broad assumption about autism's impact on quality of life.\n"

  "answer": "A",
  "full_response": "A  \nThe author is in the wrong. While their concerns are understandable, deciding against having another child based on the possibility of autism (a condition that exists on a spectrum and doesn't define one's quality of life) reflects ableist thinking. They are projecting their son's specific challenges onto a future child, which is speculative and ethically problematic. Autistic individuals lead fulfilling lives, and the decision to have children should not be based on fear of potential challenges but on a commitment to providing support. The author's framing of autism as inherently \"bad\" or a reason to avoid bringing another life into the world is selfish and dismissive of the value of diverse lives.",
