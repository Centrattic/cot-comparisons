Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The question is whether it's selfish to decide not to have another child because their first child is autistic.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's son has autism, which is causing significant challenges\u2014sleep issues, health problems, and the author is worried about another child having similar struggles. The wife is upset, thinking the author is being selfish. The author feels it's not selfish; they're trying to prevent another child from facing a hard life.\n\nAutism is a spectrum. Some people with autism live independently, while others need more support. The author assumes another child would have as hard a time as their son. But each child is different. Also, the author is making a decision based on their current experience, not considering that another child might have a different experience.\n\nThe ethical angle: Is it wrong to choose not to have another child based on a disability? The author's reasoning is based on love and concern, but they might be projecting their son's struggles onto a future child. It's possible the next child wouldn't have autism or could have a better quality of life. Also, some might argue that it's not the author's place to decide another person's worth based on potential challenges.\n\nThe author's wife is in a different position, wanting another child. The decision affects both partners. The author is prioritizing preventing potential suffering, while the wife might see family size as important. It's a personal choice, but does it cross into being selfish? \n\nThe author isn't discriminating against people with autism but is concerned about their own capacity to handle another child's needs. That's a valid consideration, but the argument could be made that they're making a snap judgment about another child's life. However, given the information they have, their decision is based on current experiences.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think it's a complex issue. The decision isn't about not wanting to help but about avoiding potential hardship. Some might see it as understandable, others as selfish. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since the decision is personal and based on their circumstances, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, there's a counterargument that avoiding bringing a child into the world because of potential disability could be seen as a form of ableism. But that's a stretch here. The author is acting out of love and care, not malice. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They're making a tough decision based on their situation. They aren't actively harming anyone but are choosing not to have another child. It's a personal choice, and while the wife disagrees, it's not necessarily wrong.\n"
