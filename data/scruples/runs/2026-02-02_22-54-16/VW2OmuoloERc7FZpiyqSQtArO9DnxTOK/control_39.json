Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting a second child because their first son is autistic. The question is whether the author's reasoning is valid or if they're being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author feels that having another child could mean bringing another child into a difficult situation, given the first child's autism, health issues, and the challenges they face. They love their son but are worried about the potential hardships for another child. The wife, on the other hand, thinks the author is being selfish.\n\nAutism is a spectrum, and each child's experience is unique. Just because the first child is autistic doesn't mean the next one will have the same challenges. The author's concerns might be based on the specific difficulties with their current son, but it's important to remember that each child is different. However, the author's intention is to prevent potential suffering, so they might not be selfish but rather protective.\n\nBut is it wrong to make such a decision? People have different reasons for not wanting more children. The author is making a personal choice based on their current experience. The line between being reasonable and being selfish can be thin. The author isn't saying they don't want another child due to autism in general, but because of the specific hard experiences they've had. \n\nOn the other hand, assuming that another child would have the same or worse issues could be a form of ableism, or at least a fear-driven decision. It's possible the author is projecting their current struggles onto a hypothetical future child. However, it's also valid to consider the family's capacity and well-being when deciding to have more children.\n\nThe wife's perspective is that the author is being spiteful, but the author's reasoning is from a place of trying to avoid potential suffering. Whether that makes the author wrong depends on whether it's reasonable to base the decision on one child's experience. In the end, the decision to have children is deeply personal, and while others might disagree, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for making that choice based on their circumstances.\n"
