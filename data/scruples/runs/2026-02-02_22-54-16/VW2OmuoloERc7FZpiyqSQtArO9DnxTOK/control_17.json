Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The author found out their son has autism and is deciding against having a second child because of that. They mention the challenges their son faces, like sleep issues, health problems, and the potential for the next child to have similar or worse conditions. The wife thinks the author is being selfish, but he thinks he's doing the right thing by not risking another child's quality of life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author's concern is about not wanting another child to suffer. But is it their place to decide that? Autism is a spectrum, and people have varying experiences. Some find fulfillment in their lives, while others face more challenges. The author is making an assumption that another child would have a \"life as hard\" as the first, which might not be accurate. There's also the aspect of reproductive rights. A couple should have the autonomy to decide whether to have more children based on their circumstances, even if others disagree.\n\nOn the other hand, the argument against the author might be that they're making a decision based on a disability, which could be seen as ableist. Society often stigmatizes autism and other disabilities, and choosing not to have another child because of the potential for a disability might reflect that stigma. However, the author's reasoning is rooted in their current experiences with their son's needs and the family's capacity to handle more children. They mention physical and emotional tolls, which are valid factors in family planning.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's decision is considered selfish or reasonable. The wife thinks it's selfish, but the author feels it's about protecting a future child from hardship. There's no right or wrong answer in such personal decisions, but the question is about whether the author is the \"asshole.\" In the AITA context, the community often looks at intent and impact. The author's intent is to avoid putting another child through what their son is going through, which is a valid concern. However, the impact is that they're not giving their wife the second child she wants, which is a personal choice. \n\nThe author is not in the wrong because they are making a difficult decision based on their current family dynamics and the well-being of potential future children. It's a personal choice, even if others disagree. So the answer is B.\n"
