Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting another child after finding out their first son has autism. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's concerns are valid. They mention their son's challenges: autism, lack of sleep, eczema, allergies, and behavioral issues. The decision not to have another child is based on not wanting another child to face similar hardships. They also express a fear of the child being bullied, based on their own school experiences. \n\nNow, the key here is personal choice and ethics. The author is making a decision based on their values and what they perceive as the best for potential future children. They love their son but are prioritizing the well-being of a hypothetical future child. Their wife disagrees, calling them selfish. But does that make the author wrong?\n\nAutism is a spectrum, and the severity varies. However, the author is not choosing to avoid the challenges of autism itself but the potential for similar or worse conditions. It's not about autism per se but the combination of issues. The author isn't making a judgment about people with autism but about the quality of life they might face. \n\nSocietal perspectives might say that life is worth living despite challenges, and that parents should not decide based on potential hardships. However, the author is making a personal choice influenced by their experiences. It's important to note that they\u2019re not discriminating against their son but are cautious about future children's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's selfish to base a decision on avoiding potential suffering, regardless of the child's future. But others might support the author's right to choose their family size based on their assessment of what's best for their children. \n\nUltimately, this is a deeply personal decision. The author isn't acting out of malice but concern. They\u2019re not denying their son's worth but acknowledging the difficulties. Whether one agrees with the decision is subjective, but being in the \"wrong\" implies wrongdoing, which isn't the case here. The author's reasoning is based on their circumstances and values, so they're not in the wrong.\n"
