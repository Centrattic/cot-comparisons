Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation. The parent found out their son has autism and related health issues. They're now reconsidering having a second child because they don't want another child to go through similar hardships. The wife thinks the parent is being selfish, but the parent feels they're being responsible.\n\nFirst, I should consider the parent's reasoning. They mention their son's challenges: sleep issues, health problems, and autism. They don't want to bring another child into a situation where they might face similar or worse struggles. The parent argues it's not selfish but rather a decision to avoid potential suffering. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife thinks the parent is being selfish. The question is whether the parent's decision is justified or if they're wrong for not wanting another child. \n\nI should think about autonomy and personal choice. Parents have the right to make decisions based on their family's circumstances. However, there's also the aspect of not making assumptions about another child's future. The parent is making a choice based on their current child's condition, but autism is a spectrum, and another child might not have the same level of challenges. \n\nIs it ethical to decide not to have another child based on the possibility of them having a hard life? Some might argue that life's challenges are part of the human experience, and parents should not decide for another person's potential life. Others might say that parents have a duty to consider their ability to provide care and not subject a child to unnecessary suffering. \n\nAlso, the parent loves their son deeply but is concerned about the quality of life. There's a difference between not wanting to bring another child into a difficult situation versus not wanting to handle more stress. The parent's reasons might be well-meaning, but it's possible they're projecting their current struggles onto a future child without knowing the actual circumstances. \n\nThe key points: Is the parent justified in their decision? Is it selfish to avoid potential hardship for another child? Or is the parent making a responsible choice based on their current situation? \n\nI think the answer depends on ethical perspectives. If the parent is making a choice based on their capacity to handle another child's needs, that's one thing. But if they're assuming that another child would have a worse life, that's different. The author might not be in the wrong because they're making a personal decision about their family's future, but others might see it as selfish. However, since the question is whether they are in the wrong, the answer could be B (No), as it's a personal choice, but there's a counterargument. I need to decide based on the information given.\n"
