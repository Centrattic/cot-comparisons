Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a parent who found out their son has autism and now doesn't want a second child because they don't want another child to go through similar struggles. The wife thinks the author is selfish, but the author feels the opposite.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the main points. The son has autism, which comes with significant challenges: sleep issues, health problems, and the parent's concern about the child's future. The author is worried about bringing another child into the world with similar or worse difficulties. The question is whether the author is being selfish, thus in the wrong.\n\nAutism is a spectrum, so not all autistic individuals have the same level of difficulty. The author's son is described as having severe symptoms, but it's not clear if all autistic children are the same. The author's reasoning is that having another child could result in similar challenges, so they prefer not to take the risk. \n\nThe ethical question here is about choice. The author is making a personal decision based on their current experiences. They are not forced to have another child, so it's their right to choose. However, the wife feels hurt because the author is making a decision that affects them both. The author is not denying the wife's wishes but is prioritizing their own concerns.\n\nSelfishness would involve disregarding others' well-being for personal gain. Here, the author is considering the potential well-being of a future child. They are trying to avoid subjecting another child to a hard life. However, this is speculative because autism is variable, and not all autistic individuals have the same issues. Also, the author is making a judgment about their son's life quality, which might not be fair since the son is happy in his own way.\n\nOn one hand, the author's decision is personal and based on their experiences. On the other, it might be seen as making a choice without knowing the future child's actual condition. The author might be projecting their son's specific challenges onto a potential sibling, which might not be accurate. \n\nThe wife's perspective is also important. She might feel that the author is dismissing their previous desire for a second child and is now making a unilateral decision. The author's concern is valid, but the way it's communicated could be a problem. The author is not in the wrong for having concerns, but they need to consider their partner's feelings and the ethical implications of deciding another child's life based on potential hardships.\n\nIn terms of ethics, some might argue that all lives have value, and it's not for parents to decide based on perceived difficulties. Others might support the author's decision as a responsible choice to avoid future suffering. The answer might depend on cultural and personal values. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because it's a personal choice based on their circumstances, even if others disagree.\n"
