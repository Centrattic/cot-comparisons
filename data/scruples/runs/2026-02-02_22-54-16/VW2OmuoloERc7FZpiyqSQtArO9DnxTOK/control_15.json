Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they have a son with autism and they don't want to have a second child because of the potential for the next child to have similar or worse challenges. The wife thinks the author is being selfish, but he feels the opposite.\n\nFirst, I should consider the author's reasons. He mentions his son's autism, sleep issues, health problems like eczema and allergies. He's worried about bringing another child into a life that might be as hard or harder. He loves his son but is concerned about the quality of life for another child. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife thinks he's being selfish. Maybe she believes they should give the second child a chance, or that they can handle another child despite the challenges. It's possible that the author is making a decision based on his own fears, but is it fair to judge him?\n\nAutism is a spectrum, so not all children with autism have the same level of difficulty. The author is assuming that another child might have similar issues, but that's not certain. However, making a decision based on potential risks is understandable. People have the right to make choices about their family size based on their circumstances and what they feel is best for their family.\n\nIs it selfish to not want to have another child if there's a risk of similar challenges? Some might argue that life is inherently uncertain and that everyone faces hardships. Others might say that the author is prioritizing his own comfort and fears over the possibility of another child having a fulfilling life with support. But the author is making a choice based on his current experience and wants to avoid future suffering for another child. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's reasoning is valid. He's not opposing having children in general, just a second one due to the specific circumstances. People have different ethical views on this. Some might say it's reasonable to consider the risks, especially if there's a genetic component. Others might think it's wrong to assume another child would have the same issues or that the family can't provide support.\n\nI think the answer depends on personal values. The author is making a decision based on his assessment of his family's situation. Unless there's a clear ethical obligation to have more children, which there isn't, his choice isn't necessarily wrong. However, some might criticize him for not considering that he could provide support for another child. But the author's concern is about the child's potential suffering, which is a valid consideration. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. His reasoning is based on his experiences and concerns for a future child's well-being. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
