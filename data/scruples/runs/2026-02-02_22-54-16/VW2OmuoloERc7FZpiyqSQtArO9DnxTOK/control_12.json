Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not wanting a second child after their first son was diagnosed with autism. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The father is expressing concern about potentially bringing another child into a situation where they might face similar challenges. He cites his son's autism, sleep issues, allergies, and eczema. He's worried about the child's quality of life and the possibility of them being bullied or having a hard life.\n\nOn one hand, making decisions based on potential health issues in a future child can be seen as eugenics or selective breeding, which is a sensitive topic. However, the father is not making a decision based on race, gender, or other protected characteristics but rather on medical conditions affecting the child's well-being. His argument is that he doesn't want to subject another child to similar hardships, which he perceives as not fair.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife thinks he's being selfish. This could be because she still wants another child and might feel his decision is prioritizing his own concerns over their shared family plans. There's also the aspect of autonomy in reproductive choices. Each parent has their own reasons for wanting or not wanting children. The father is making a personal choice based on his current experiences.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) the father's right to make decisions about having more children, 2) the ethical considerations of not wanting a child due to potential disabilities, and 3) the balance between personal well-being and family planning. \n\nIn many societies, parents do consider the potential for their children to have health issues when deciding to have more children. It's a personal choice and not necessarily unethical unless it's based on discriminatory reasons. Since autism is a neurodevelopmental condition and not a disease, avoiding having another child because of the risk of autism isn't about preventing illness but about the potential for different life experiences. However, the father's reasoning could also be seen as avoiding the challenges, which might be selfish from the wife's perspective.\n\nBut ethically, it's often accepted that parents can make decisions based on their ability to care for a child. If having another child with similar needs would be too overwhelming for the family, it's reasonable to reconsider. The father is prioritizing the child's potential quality of life, which can be a valid concern. However, there's a line where this could lead to discrimination against people with disabilities, implying that their lives are less valuable. \n\nThe father's statement that he doesn't want to \"roll the dice\" is a gamble with their family's future. His perspective is that bringing another child into such a situation could be harmful, which is a personal belief. Whether this is selfish or a justified concern depends on cultural and personal values. In many cases, people do choose not to have children for various personal reasons, and this isn't necessarily seen as wrong.\n\nConsidering all angles, the father isn't in the wrong because he's making a personal decision based on his family's current circumstances and his perception of the child's future well-being. It's a difficult decision, but it's his right to make. The answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
