Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting another child due to their son's autism.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parents have a son with autism, confirmed by a specialist. The son has significant challenges: sleep issues, allergies, eczema, and behavioral problems. The father is concerned that another child might inherit these issues and not want to bring another child into such a hard life. The wife thinks he's being selfish, but he feels it's responsible.\n\nNow, the ethical dilemma here is about whether it's selfish to not have another child based on the possibility of similar challenges. On one hand, the father is making a decision based on the potential suffering of another child. He's prioritizing the child's well-being. On the other hand, some might argue that he's making assumptions about the future child's life quality and that it's not his to decide.\n\nI should consider the arguments for both sides. The father's stance is about not wanting to subject another child to hardship, which could be seen as compassionate. But others might say that autism isn't a curse and that people with autism can have fulfilling lives, so his decision is based on a negative perception. Also, the wife's view that he's being selfish suggests she might feel he's not considering the possibility of support and love they can provide.\n\nI need to check if there's a right or wrong here. Ethically, it's a personal choice. No one can dictate reproductive decisions. However, the father's reasoning could be seen as making assumptions about the future child's life. The key is whether the decision is based on the child's potential suffering or the parents' ability to cope. If the parents are overwhelmed, not wanting another child is understandable. But if they're making it because they think the child's life would be inherently worse, that's where the line might be drawn.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a complex issue. The father isn't necessarily wrong for making a decision based on his values and experiences, but some might argue he's underestimating the child's potential quality of life. However, since it's his personal choice, without more context about coercion or harm, it's likely not wrong. So the answer might be B, but I need to make sure.\n"
