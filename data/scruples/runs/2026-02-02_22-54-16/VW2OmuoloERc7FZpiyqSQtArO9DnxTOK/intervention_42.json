Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting another child due to their autistic son's challenges.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a son who was diagnosed with autism, which the specialist confirmed despite the usual diagnostic age. The son has significant physical and emotional challenges: sleep issues, allergies, eczema, and behavioral problems. The parents are getting very little sleep, and the author feels it's unfair to bring another child into such a difficult situation. The wife thinks the author is being selfish, but he's trying to protect a potential future child from hardship.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy in family planning and the ethical consideration of a child's well-being. The author's decision is based on personal experience and the desire to avoid repeating what they perceive as an unfair situation. While the wife disagrees, the author's reasoning isn't malicious. They love their son but are making a tough call based on their circumstances.\n\nHowever, there's also a counterpoint: can parents truly decide another child's future based on potential? Autism is a spectrum, and outcomes vary. The author's fear might be based on their son's specific struggles, not autism as a whole. But the ethical dilemma is real\u2014parents often balance risks and choose what they believe is best for their family.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and context. The author isn't being cruel but is making a difficult choice. The answer likely hinges on whether the decision is seen as selfish versus protective. Given the author's perspective and the challenges they've faced, many might side with them, seeing it as a responsible decision rather than selfishness. So, the answer is B.\n"
