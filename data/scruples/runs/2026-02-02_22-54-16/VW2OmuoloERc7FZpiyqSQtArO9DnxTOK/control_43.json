Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for deciding not to have a second child after their first son was diagnosed with autism. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's son has multiple challenges: autism, sleep issues, eczema, allergies. He's already causing significant stress on the family. The author feels that bringing another child might result in a similar situation, which they don't want. They love their son but are worried about the potential hardships for another child.\n\nNow, the key points here are autonomy in family planning, the ethical considerations of having children with potential disabilities, and societal attitudes towards disability. The author is making a personal choice based on their experience. They're not making a judgment about autism itself but about the feasibility of their family situation.\n\nI should consider if it's morally wrong to not have another child because of the risk of disability. Some might argue that it's selfish to not take the chance, while others might see it as a responsible decision given the existing challenges. The author isn't denying care or love to their current son but is concerned about the future. \n\nAlso, the mother thinks the author is being selfish, but the author sees it as not wanting to impose hardships. There's a difference between not wanting to have another child versus not supporting the child. The author is still committed to their current son. \n\nFrom a rights perspective, it's important to note that people with autism can lead fulfilling lives, so the author's concern might be based on fear rather than the actual quality of life. However, the decision to have children is a personal one, and the author is acting based on their specific circumstances.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong is subjective. The decision isn't about the autism itself but about the family's capacity to manage additional challenges. The answer depends on the ethical framework applied. Since the question asks if the author is in the wrong, and given the personal nature of such decisions, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because they are making a choice based on their situation. However, some might argue A (in the wrong) if they believe it's selfish. But given the context, the answer is likely B.\n"
