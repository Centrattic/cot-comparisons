Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe author found out their son has autism and he has other challenges like eczema, allergies, sleep issues, and violent thrashing. The author is concerned that a second child might have similar issues and doesn't want to bring another child into such a difficult situation. His wife is upset, thinking he's being selfish, but he feels it's not selfish to avoid that risk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author's reasoning is based on wanting to avoid potential suffering for another child. They love their son but are worried about the quality of life for another child. Is it ethical to not have another child because of the possibility of similar challenges? \n\nAutism is a spectrum disorder. It's not a disease but a neurodevelopmental condition with a range of experiences. Some autistic individuals lead fulfilling lives, while others face significant challenges. The author's son has specific difficulties, but that doesn't necessarily mean another child would have the same issues. However, the author is trying to make a decision based on their current experience.\n\nThe author's concern might stem from their current stress and the challenges they face. They might be prioritizing avoiding further hardships. On the other hand, the wife feels he's being selfish. But is it selfish to consider the well-being of a potential future child? Or is it a responsible decision?\n\nAlso, autism itself isn't inherently a hardship. The way society treats autistic individuals and the availability of support can greatly affect their lives. The author's perspective might not account for the possibility of better support systems or the child developing differently. There's also the aspect of choice\u2014parents have the right to decide their family size based on their circumstances.\n\nHowever, there's a risk in assuming that another child would have the same issues. Autism can present differently. The author is making a decision based on their current child's experiences, which might not reflect a future child's. Additionally, the decision to have children is deeply personal, and the author is acting on their conscience.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, some might view the author as being in the right because they're making a decision based on their family's well-being. Others might see it as avoiding responsibility or not supporting the possibility of a different experience for another child. The key is whether the author's reasoning is valid. They are not choosing to harm another child but are trying to prevent what they perceive as inevitable suffering.\n\nI should also consider if there's any element of ableism. The author is implying that autism and related conditions are inherently negative, which could be problematic. However, the post is more about the challenges they're facing rather than a judgment on autism itself. The author still loves their son but is weighing potential future hardships.\n\nIn conclusion, the decision is a personal one. The author is not in the wrong for choosing not to have another child based on their current experiences and concerns. It's a difficult decision, but it's their choice to make, and they're considering the well-being of a potential future child. The answer is B.\n"
