Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for deciding not to have a second child because their first child has autism. The author feels that bringing another child into a potentially similar situation is selfish. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is making a personal decision based on their experience with their son's challenges. They mention the son's autism, sleep issues, allergies, eczema, and the impact on their family life. The author's stance is that they don't want another child to face similar difficulties, which they perceive as a hard life.\n\nNow, the question is whether this decision is morally wrong. On one hand, autism is a neurodivergent condition, not a disease or deficit. Many people with autism live fulfilling lives, and the author's perception of their son's life as \"badly afflicted\" might be influenced by their own stress and the specific challenges they're facing. The author's concern about potential bullying is valid, but it's important to note that societal attitudes and support systems can mitigate such issues.\n\nOn the other hand, the decision not to have another child is a personal choice. Parents have the right to consider their circumstances and make decisions that they believe are in the best interest of their family. The author is not making a judgment about autism itself but is assessing their capacity to manage another child's needs given their current situation. The wife's reaction is also a factor here; differing views on family planning can lead to conflict, but the author's feelings are genuine and based on their lived experience.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is making assumptions about another child's future, which could be seen as a form of ableism if they view autism as inherently negative. The key point is whether the author's reasoning is based on the child's well-being or their own capacity to cope. If the decision is based on a belief that a potential child would have a worse life, that could be problematic. But if it's about the parents' ability to provide adequate care and support given their current resources and stress levels, it's a reasonable consideration.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's perspective might be influenced by their challenges, the decision not to have another child is a personal one and not inherently wrong. The answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
