Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting another child because their first son is autistic. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author's son has autism, sleep issues, eczema, allergies, and the author is concerned about the quality of life for a potential second child. They feel it's selfish to bring a child into such hardship. The wife, however, thinks the author is being selfish and spiteful. \n\nAutism is a neurodevelopmental condition, and while it can present challenges, it's important to note that many autistic individuals lead fulfilling lives. The author's decision is based on the desire to avoid potential suffering for another child, but this raises ethical questions. \n\nIs it right to make a decision about having another child based on the possibility of disability? The author is prioritizing their child's well-being, but others might argue that life's hardships aren't exclusive to autism and that parents should embrace whatever comes. Also, assuming the second child would have similar issues is speculative. \n\nThere's also the aspect of how the author views autism. If they see it as a burden rather than a different way of being, that could contribute to the decision. However, the author does express love for their son, which complicates the perception. \n\nThe wife's perspective is that the author is being selfish. Is the author acting in their son's best interest or their own comfort? It's a balance between personal ethics and parental responsibility.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might see not wanting a child with disabilities as selfish, while others see it as a valid choice. The key here is whether the author's reasoning is morally wrong. The author isn't making the child's life worse if they choose not to have another; they are choosing not to take on potential hardships. \n\nHowever, the ethical dilemma remains. Every child has unknown challenges, and avoiding parenthood based on one child's condition could be seen as a form of eugenics. But the author isn't making a choice based on race or eugenics, just personal circumstances. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. They are making a personal choice, but the perception of selfishness might come from differing values. The answer might depend on whether the decision is framed as avoiding hardship for the child or for the parents. Since the author is considering the child's well-being, it's a complex situation without a clear right or wrong. However, the act of deciding not to have another child based on the possibility of autism isn't inherently wrong if the parents believe it's in the potential child's interest. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
