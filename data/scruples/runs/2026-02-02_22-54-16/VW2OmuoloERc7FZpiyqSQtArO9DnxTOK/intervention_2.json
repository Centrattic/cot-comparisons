Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for deciding not to have a second child because their first son has autism. The author explains that their son has autism along with other physical issues, and they're worried that another child might have similar challenges. They love their son but feel it's selfish to bring another child into such a hard life. The wife thinks the author is being selfish, but the author feels the opposite.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's reasons for not wanting another child. They mention the struggles with their current son, like sleep issues, eczema, allergies, and autism. They also talk about the potential of another child having similar issues and not wanting to subject another child to that. The question is whether this decision makes them the asshole.\n\nI need to consider ethics and personal choice here. People have different values about having children based on their own experiences. The author is making a personal decision based on their current child's challenges. They're not being cruel, but they're also considering their own capacity to handle more children. However, some might argue that it's not fair to assume the next child would have the same issues, and that autism is a part of neurodiversity, not a curse. Also, the author's wife is upset, so there's a relationship dynamic here.\n\nBut from the author's perspective, they're trying to protect future children from potential suffering. They're honest about their feelings and not dismissing their son's struggles. The decision to have children is a personal one, and not wanting to have another due to health and potential challenges might be seen as responsible rather than selfish. However, others might say it's a form of ableism, implying that a life with autism is not worth living. \n\nThe author does express love for their son, so they're not devaluing autistic lives. They're just considering their ability to provide for another child's needs given their current situation. So, is it selfish? It's complex. The author is prioritizing their child's well-being and their own capacity to care, which might not be wrong. But the wife's perspective is also valid. \n\nIn the end, the decision to have children is a personal choice. The author isn't harming anyone by not having another child. They're making a choice based on their circumstances. So, maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
