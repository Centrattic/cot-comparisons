Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for deciding not to have a second child because their first son has autism and other challenges. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out their young son is autistic, has health issues like eczema and allergies, and their sleep is severely affected. They love their son but feel it's selfish to bring another child who might have similar difficulties. The wife disagrees, calling the author selfish.\n\nNow, considering the ethical angle. Autistic people are part of the neurodiversity movement, which emphasizes acceptance and the idea that autism is a natural variation, not a defect. The author's reasoning is based on the assumption that having autism is inherently a hardship, which contradicts the neurodiversity perspective. This could be seen as ableism, which discriminates against people with disabilities.\n\nBut the author is also considering the child's well-being and their own capacity to care. They might genuinely believe they can't provide adequate support for another child with similar needs. However, this perspective might overlook the fact that many autistic individuals lead fulfilling lives and that the challenges often come from societal attitudes rather than the autism itself.\n\nAlso, the author's decision is based on their son's specific issues. They might not realize that autism is a spectrum, and another child might not have the same level of challenges. Plus, there's the aspect of parental responsibility. The author might be projecting their current struggles onto a future child without considering potential improvements in support systems or their own ability to adapt.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is expressing their feelings and making a personal choice. While their reasoning is problematic, does that make them the \"asshole\"? The term \"asshole\" here is subjective. They aren't harming anyone directly; they're sharing their dilemma. However, their views could be considered harmful if they reinforce negative stereotypes about autism.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's stance is based on a flawed understanding of autism, which could be seen as discriminatory. However, they are making a personal choice based on their experiences. The answer hinges on whether the question is about moral wrongness versus harmful beliefs. Since the question is about being in the wrong, and given the neurodiversity perspective, the author might be considered in the wrong (A) because their reasoning is ableist, even if their intentions are to protect a future child.\n"
