Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that they found out their young son has autism and other health issues, and they don't want another child because they don't want another child to have a hard life like their son. Their wife thinks they're being selfish, but the author feels they're being responsible.\n\nFirst, I should consider the author's reasoning. They love their son but are worried about bringing another child into a situation where they might have similar challenges. They mention sleep deprivation, medical issues, and autism. They're concerned about the child's quality of life and potential bullying. The author believes it's selfish to bring a child into such hardship, but their wife disagrees.\n\nNow, ethical perspectives. From a deontological view, maybe the duty is to not be selfish and have a child regardless. Utilitarianism might weigh the potential suffering against the happiness. But the author is making a personal choice based on their experience. \n\nAutism is a spectrum; having one autistic child doesn't guarantee the next will be the same. The author might be overgeneralizing. But they have firsthand experience of the challenges, which is valid. They're making a decision based on their capacity to provide care and the child's potential well-being.\n\nThe wife thinks the author is selfish, but the author sees it as protecting a future child. Is it selfish to prioritize the child's potential well-being? Or is it avoiding responsibility? It's a tough balance. The decision not to have another child is a personal choice, and while others may disagree, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for making that choice based on their circumstances.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
