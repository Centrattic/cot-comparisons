Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for not wanting another child because their first child is autistic. The main points from the story are that the son has autism, severe eczema, allergies, and sleep issues. The author feels it's too much to handle and doesn't want to risk another child having similar challenges. The wife thinks the author is being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is making a personal decision based on their current experiences. Autism is a spectrum, and while it can present challenges, it's not inherently a bad thing. Every child is unique, and having autism doesn't mean a life of suffering. The author is projecting his son's specific difficulties onto a potential future child, which might be an oversimplification. However, the author's concerns about resources, stress, and quality of life are valid. They mention only getting 3-5 hours of sleep and the physical and emotional toll.\n\nBut then, is it right to decide not to have another child based on the possibility of autism? Some might argue that it's a personal choice and not the author's place to decide another child's life quality. Others might agree with the author's stance, prioritizing their ability to provide care. The key here is the author's reasoning. They express a desire to avoid potential suffering, but they're making an assumption about what another autistic child's life would be like. Also, autism is genetic, so there's a higher chance, but it's not guaranteed. The author is choosing not to take the risk.\n\nThe wife's perspective is important too. She might feel the decision is selfish because they had always wanted another child. The author's concern about bullying and societal treatment of autistic kids adds another layer. But it's possible the author is overestimating the challenges based on past experiences.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the decision to have children is personal. However, the author's reasoning might be seen as problematic if it's based on a negative view of autism. It's important to recognize that autistic individuals can lead fulfilling lives. The author might be conflating their son's specific issues with autism itself. Also, deciding against another child due to potential disability raises questions about societal attitudes towards disability. But the author's primary concern is their capacity to care and the potential quality of life for another child, which is a valid consideration.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer hinges on whether the decision is based on a negative perception of autism or a realistic assessment of their current situation. If the author is making a choice based on their ability to cope and provide adequate care, it's understandable. However, if the decision is rooted in viewing autism as a curse or a negative condition, that's a different matter. The story doesn't clearly indicate that; instead, it's more about the author's personal capacity and the specific challenges they face. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for making a personal choice based on their circumstances, even if others disagree.\n"
