Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. Let me start by breaking down the scenario.\n\nThe author and their wife found out their young son is autistic. The son has various challenges: sleep issues, health problems like eczema and allergies, and the author is concerned about bringing another child into the world who might have similar or worse difficulties. The wife feels the author is being selfish, but the author thinks they're being responsible.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical implications here. The author is making a personal decision not to have another child because of their son's condition. They express a desire to avoid potentially causing another child to face similar hardships. On the other hand, the wife thinks this is selfish. \n\nAutism is a spectrum disorder, and while some individuals face significant challenges, others lead fulfilling lives. The author is generalizing that another child might have an equally hard life, which might not be certain. However, the author's primary concern is for the potential well-being of a future child, which is a valid parental consideration. \n\nSocietally, there's often a stigma or lack of understanding around autism, as the author mentions their school experiences. However, it's important to recognize that autism is part of a person's identity and not inherently a tragedy. The author's perspective might be influenced by the stress and challenges they're currently facing with their son.\n\nThe key question here is whether the author's decision is selfish. The author isn't choosing to have the child for the child's benefit but based on their own ability to cope. However, the decision is also made with the child's future in mind. The wife's argument is that the author is being spiteful, which might stem from the author's negative comments about autism potentially leading to bullying and a hard life. \n\nIt's possible that the author's decision is influenced by their current stress and the challenges they're facing, rather than an objective assessment of what's best for a future child. However, the author is not forcing the decision on the wife; it's a personal choice. The ethical dilemma here is between the parent's right to make such decisions and the potential for that decision to be seen as making a judgment about the value of a life with autism.\n\nIn some ethical frameworks, the idea of not creating a life that could be suffering is considered, but others argue that it's not for parents to judge the worth of another's life. The author's stance could be seen as a form of ableism if it implies that a life with autism is inherently worse, but the author's intention seems to be to protect the future child from hardship, not to devalue their life.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The decision is deeply personal, and while the author's reasoning might be based on their current experiences, it's not necessarily wrong. However, the way they express their concerns (e.g., using terms like \"badly afflicted\") could be seen as negative towards people with autism, which might contribute to the wife's feeling that the author is being spiteful. The answer might depend on whether the author's reasoning is seen as valid or not. If the answer is A (in the wrong), it's because they're making a judgment that could be considered ableist. If B (not in the wrong), it's because personal decision-making about family planning is a right they have, even if others disagree.\n"
