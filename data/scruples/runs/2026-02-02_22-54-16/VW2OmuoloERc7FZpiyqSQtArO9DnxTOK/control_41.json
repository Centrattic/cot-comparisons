Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they found out their son has autism, and they don't want to have another child because they don't want another child to go through similar struggles. The wife thinks the author is being selfish, but he thinks he's not. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is making a decision based on his son's challenges\u2014Autism, health issues, sleep problems, etc. He loves his son but is concerned about bringing another child into a situation where they might face similar difficulties. He's worried about the child's potential quality of life and doesn't want them to be bullied like others he's seen. \n\nNow, is it selfish to not want another child because of the existing child's condition? Well, the author isn't making the child's condition the fault of anything but a reality. Decisions about having children are deeply personal. People have various reasons for not wanting more kids\u2014financial, health, lifestyle, etc. Here, the reason is the potential for another child to face hardships similar to their son's.\n\nBut then, is it wrong to consider the child's future quality of life? Some might argue that life's challenges are part of being human, and that bringing a child into the world is a gamble regardless. Others might say that the author is overestimating the difficulties or underestimating his ability to support another child. Also, autism is a spectrum; not all autistic people face the same level of difficulty. The author is assuming the next child would have similar or worse issues, which isn't necessarily guaranteed.\n\nThe wife's reaction is that he's being selfish and spiteful. Maybe she feels he's not giving enough credit to their ability to handle more challenges, or she might believe that they should embrace the possibility of helping another child. Alternatively, she might feel that not having another child is a way of avoiding responsibility or fear.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is it wrong to prioritize not increasing potential suffering? The author isn't making a decision against another child because of the child's potential traits (like disability) but because he wants to avoid potential hardship. However, others might argue that every child could face hardships, and that the decision is based on a fear of future problems rather than the current situation.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that he loves his son, which shows he's not rejecting his child. His concern is about the future and not wanting another child to go through similar struggles. It's a tough balance between acknowledging real challenges and making a decision that feels right for the family.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, some might view the author as being in the right because he's making a personal decision based on his circumstances. Others might see it as selfish because he's not considering the possibility that another child could have a different experience or that they could provide support. \n\nSo, considering all these angles, the answer isn't black and white. But according to the question's options, I have to choose A or B. The options are whether the author is in the wrong. If I think the author isn't in the wrong, then B. If I think he is, then A. \n\nThe key here is that the author isn't making a judgment against autistic people but is deciding based on his capacity and willingness to handle potential suffering. Since the decision is personal and based on their family's situation, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong). However, some might argue that wanting children despite potential challenges is the right choice, but the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for his decision. Since the decision is his personal choice and he's not harming anyone by not having another child, B seems correct.\n"
