Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for deciding not to have a second child because their first child is autistic. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his wife have a young son with autism, which was confirmed by a specialist. The son has multiple challenges: sleep issues, eczema, allergies, and autism. The author loves his son but is hesitant to have another child because they don't want another child to go through similar struggles. The wife thinks he's being selfish, but he feels he's being responsible.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for this decision. Let's break it down. The author is making a personal choice based on his family's circumstances. He's not making a value judgment about autism itself but is considering the potential hardships. He's not saying autism is bad, just that he doesn't want another child to face those challenges. \n\nAutism is a spectrum disorder with varying degrees of impact. The author is aware of his son's specific challenges and is concerned about the possibility of another child having similar or worse issues. His reasoning is that bringing a child into the world with a difficult life is selfish. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the decision is based on incorrect assumptions. For example, autism is a part of human diversity, and many people with autism live fulfilling lives. The author's perspective could be seen as ableist if he's devaluing the worth of autistic individuals. Also, the decision to have children is complex and involves many factors. The wife's feelings are also important here, and the author's decision affects their shared plans.\n\nBut the author emphasizes that he loves his son deeply and isn't rejecting autism but is considering the specific hardships. He's not making a general statement against autism but is acting in what he believes is the best interest for future children. The decision is personal and not a public moral issue. \n\nIn terms of ethics, people have the right to make reproductive choices based on their circumstances. The key is whether the author is being judgmental about autism itself. If he's not, and is just considering the specific challenges his family faces, his decision isn't inherently wrong. However, others might see it as a lack of acceptance of neurodiversity. \n\nThe wife's perspective is that he's being selfish, which adds tension. But the author doesn't have an obligation to have more children despite his current situation. His decision is a personal one, and while others might disagree, it's not necessarily wrong unless it's based on harmful stereotypes. The author's reasoning is about potential hardships, which is a valid consideration for family planning.\n"
