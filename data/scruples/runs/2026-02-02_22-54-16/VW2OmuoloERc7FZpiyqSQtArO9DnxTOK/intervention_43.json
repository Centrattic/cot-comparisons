Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent deciding against having a second child because their first child has autism, and they're worried the next child might have similar or worse issues.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's son has autism, which was diagnosed early, and he's dealing with a lot of challenges\u2014sleep issues, eczema, allergies. The parent feels that bringing another child into the world with possible similar hardships is selfish. The wife thinks the author is being selfish and spiteful, but he feels he's being responsible.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for making this decision. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nI should consider the ethical aspects here. Family planning is a personal decision. The parent is expressing concern for the child's well-being, which is a valid consideration. However, some might argue that not wanting to have another child could be based on ableism or fear, implying that people with autism have a lower quality of life. But the parent also mentions loving their son deeply, so it's not about devaluing people with autism but rather about avoiding potential suffering.\n\nAnother angle is the parent's own capacity to handle another child with similar needs. They're already stretched thin with sleep and other medical issues. The decision to not have another child could be seen as responsible, considering their current resources and emotional state.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent's reasoning might be influenced by their own perception of autism's impact. It's important to note that autism is a spectrum, and many individuals live fulfilling lives. The parent's experience with bullying in school might skew their view, but each person's experience is unique.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, deciding not to have another child is a personal choice, and the parent is prioritizing what they believe is best for their family's well-being. They're not making a blanket judgment against people with autism but are considering their specific circumstances. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
