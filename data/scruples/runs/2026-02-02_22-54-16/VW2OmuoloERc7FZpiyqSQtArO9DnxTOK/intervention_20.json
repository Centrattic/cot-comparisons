Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for deciding not to have a second child after their son was diagnosed with autism. The author mentions that their son has autism, along with other health issues like eczema and allergies, and they're worried about bringing another child into a potentially difficult situation. They feel it's selfish, but their wife thinks they're being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is making a personal choice based on their child's challenges. Autism is a spectrum, and while some face significant difficulties, others don't. The author is concerned about another child possibly having similar or worse issues. But is it wrong to not want another child for this reason?\n\nOn one hand, people have the right to make reproductive choices based on their circumstances and well-being. If having another child would add to their stress and challenges, it's understandable. The author is prioritizing the potential well-being of the future child and their family's quality of life. They mention their son's physical and emotional struggles, which are legitimate concerns.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's a form of ableism to assume that a child with autism (or any disability) would have a \"hard\" life. Every child's experience is unique, and many people with autism lead fulfilling lives. The author's perspective might be influenced by the challenges they've already faced, which is a valid personal experience, but others might see it as a prejudgment against a potential future child's abilities.\n\nThe author's wife is upset, thinking they're being selfish. This highlights differing views on what's best for a family. The key here is that the author isn't making a decision out of malice but out of concern for their existing child and the family's capacity. It's a personal decision, and as long as it's mutual between the parents, it's their choice. However, if one parent is pressuring the other, that's a problem. In this case, the author has changed their mind after the diagnosis, which is a new development. \n\nI should also consider the argument that avoiding a child due to a risk of autism could reduce the number of people with autism, which some might see as a negative. But others might argue that it's about family readiness and resources. The author is not denying their son any care but is considering their own limits and future possibilities.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision is based on personal and family circumstances, which are valid. While there might be differing opinions on ableism, the right to choose not to have another child due to these factors exists. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
