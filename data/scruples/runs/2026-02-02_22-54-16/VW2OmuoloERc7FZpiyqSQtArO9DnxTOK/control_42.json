Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting another child after finding out their son has autism. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's son was diagnosed with autism, and he has other challenges like sleep issues, allergies, and eczema. The author loves his son but is worried about bringing another child into a life with similar or worse difficulties. The wife thinks the author is being selfish, but he feels he's being responsible.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether it's selfish to not want another child because of the potential hardships. The author's reasoning is that they don't want another child to face similar struggles, especially considering the risk of autism and other conditions. But is this a valid concern or is it wrong?\n\nAutism is a spectrum, and each child is unique. The author's son has significant challenges, but another child with autism might have a different experience. Also, the author's perspective might be influenced by his own child's difficulties and societal stigma (like bullying). However, the author's concern is about the child's well-being, which is a personal decision.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the decision to have children is personal. People can choose based on their circumstances and values. The author is prioritizing potentially avoiding future suffering for another child. However, others might argue that life has inherent challenges, and it's not in anyone's place to decide another's worth of life. Also, the author's assumption that a future child would have a worse life isn't certain. \n\nThe wife's reaction might stem from feeling that the author is undermining their son's value by not wanting another child. It's a sensitive topic with no clear right or wrong. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's decision is based on his feelings and experiences. It's a personal choice, and while some might disagree, it's not necessarily wrong. The answer would be B (not in the wrong) because it's a matter of personal values and not an objective wrong.\n"
