Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether it's selfish to not want another child because their existing son has autism and other challenges. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that their son has autism, which was diagnosed early, and he's dealing with a lot of physical and behavioral issues. The author loves their son but feels it's too much to bring another child into a similar situation. The wife thinks the author is being selfish and spiteful.\n\nI need to consider the ethical aspects. Parental decisions about having more children often involve personal values and what they believe is best for the child and the family. The author is concerned about the potential quality of life for another child if they inherit similar conditions. On the other hand, some might argue that it's not fair to assume another child would have the same issues and that the decision could be seen as discriminatory towards people with disabilities.\n\nAutism is a spectrum, so not all children with autism have the same level of challenges. The author is making a decision based on their son's specific circumstances. However, choosing not to have another child because of the possibility of disability might be viewed as ableism\u2014assuming that a life with autism is necessarily worse. This could be seen as the author's own bias rather than the child's actual experience.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't want another child to go through what their son is going through. But this could be seen as projecting their own struggles onto a future child, who might have a different experience. It's important to consider that people with autism can lead fulfilling lives, and the author's decision might be based on fear or lack of support rather than the inherent value of the potential child's life.\n\nThe wife's perspective is that the author is being selfish. This could be because she believes that the decision is based on fear or not considering the possibility of adapting or getting more support. The author's stance might also overlook the fact that parents often take on significant challenges for their children, and giving up on having another child might be a way to avoid future difficulties.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the principle of procreative responsibility vs. the right to life comes into play. The author is choosing not to take on more potential hardships, but others might argue that they shouldn't make that choice for another potential person. However, the author isn't denying existing children with autism their value but is making a personal choice based on their current situation.\n\nI think the key here is whether the decision is based on fear or ableism. If the author believes that a child with autism would necessarily have a worse life, that's problematic. But if they're honestly evaluating their ability to provide adequate care and support given their current circumstances, it's a personal choice. However, the way the author frames it as \"selfish\" vs. \"not wanting to roll the dice\" might indicate a lack of willingness to accept potential challenges, which could be seen as wrong.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because their reasoning could perpetuate negative stereotypes about autism and not acknowledging that people with autism can have valuable lives. Additionally, making a decision based on the assumption that another child would have the same level of challenges is speculative and potentially discriminatory.\n"
