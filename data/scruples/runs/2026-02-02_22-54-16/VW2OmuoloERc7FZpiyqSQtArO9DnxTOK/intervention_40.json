Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for deciding not to have a second child after their first son is diagnosed with autism. The user thinks the author is not wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author and his wife have a young son with autism, along with other challenges like eczema and allergies. The son's behavior is very demanding, affecting their sleep and daily life. The father is now hesitant to have another child, fearing that a second child might also have similar issues, leading to a difficult life. His wife is upset, accusing him of being selfish, but he feels it's a responsible decision.\n\nSo, the key points here are personal choice, parental responsibility, and the ethical implications of having children with potential disabilities. The father is making a decision based on his assessment of his family's well-being and the potential child's quality of life. He's not trying to avoid responsibility but is considering the future. On the other hand, his wife feels he's being selfish, which suggests a conflict in their values or perspectives.\n\nAutism is a spectrum, and while it comes with challenges, many autistic individuals lead fulfilling lives. The father's concerns might be influenced by the specific hardships they're currently facing. However, deciding not to have another child based on the risk of similar issues is a personal choice. Society often values the right to make such decisions about family planning, even if others may disagree.\n\nIt's important to note that autism itself isn't a negative thing; it's a part of neurodiversity. The father's perspective seems to stem from the current difficulties rather than autism as a whole. His decision isn't necessarily against having children but about the potential for another child with similar challenges. This is a complex ethical issue where there's no clear right or wrong, but rather a matter of personal values and circumstances.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, unless there's coercion or harm intended, personal decisions about family size are typically seen as the parent's right. The father isn't causing harm by not having another child; he's prioritizing his family's current situation. His wife's feelings of being an \"asshole\" might be due to differing views on risk and responsibility. The answer would depend on whether one views his decision as selfish or a responsible choice based on current challenges.\n"
