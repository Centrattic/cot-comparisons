Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they found out their son is autistic and are considering not having a second child because they don't want another child to have a similar or harder life. The wife thinks the author is selfish and spiteful, but he feels the opposite.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is making a personal decision based on their son's condition. Autistic individuals often face challenges, but many also lead fulfilling lives. The author's concern is about potentially increasing the child's suffering. However, decisions about having children are complex and involve personal values.\n\nThe author mentions their son's physical difficulties like eczema, allergies, and sleep issues. These factors contribute to his stress, but autism itself is a neurodevelopmental condition that brings both challenges and strengths. The author might be conflating the physical issues with autism, but not all autistic children have those conditions.\n\nThen there's the aspect of autonomy. It's the author's decision whether to have another child, and their reasoning is based on their experiences. However, by not wanting a second child, are they denying the child a chance to live their own life, even with potential challenges? This is a common debate in pro-choice vs. anti-choice arguments.\n\nThe wife's perspective is also important. She might feel that the author is making a judgment about possible future children, which could be seen as prejudging their potential quality of life. The author's statement about not wanting to \"roll those dice\" could imply a belief that having autism or similar issues is worse, which others might argue is a form of ableism.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's motivation is to avoid causing a child to suffer, which is a natural parental concern. The decision is influenced by their current situation and the stress they're under. But is it right to base future decisions solely on one child's experience?\n\nI should also consider the possibility of future improvements in support and understanding for autistic individuals. The author might be underestimating the potential for a second child to have a different experience, maybe with more support or a better environment.\n\nIn terms of selfishness, the author is prioritizing their own ability to cope and the potential well-being of the future child. But if the future child is given the same love and support, maybe they could thrive. The parent's responsibility is to provide care, not to determine the worth of another's life.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? They might not be intentionally being harmful, but their reasoning could be based on assumptions about the lives of children with autism. The answer might depend on whether their stance is informed by ableist thinking or genuine concern for the child's well-being.\n"
