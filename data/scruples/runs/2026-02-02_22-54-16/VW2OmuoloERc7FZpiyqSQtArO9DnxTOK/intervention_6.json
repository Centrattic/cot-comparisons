Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting a second child because their first child has autism. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasoning. They mention their son has autism, which is confirmed by a specialist. He's dealing with sleep issues, medical problems like eczema and allergies, and the parents are getting very little sleep. The author feels it's selfish to bring another child into the world who might have similar or worse challenges. The wife thinks the author is being selfish, but the author believes they're acting in the child's best interest.\n\nI need to evaluate whether the author's decision is justified. Autistic individuals have their own strengths and challenges, but the author's fear is based on their son's specific struggles. However, autism is a spectrum, so each child is unique. The author is making a decision based on their current experience, which is understandable. On the other hand, some might argue that it's not fair to assume another child would have the same issues, or that it's not the parents' fault.\n\nAlso, the author mentions their son is 4, and the diagnosis came at that age. The author's intuition picked up signs earlier, but the actual diagnosis is recent. The sleep deprivation and physical health issues add to the stress. The author's concern is about preventing another child from facing similar hardships, which is a form of parental concern for the child's well-being.\n\nI should also consider if the author is discriminating against autistic individuals. By not wanting another child to avoid autism, is that a form of ableism? Or is it a personal choice based on their specific circumstances? The author loves their son but is worried about future suffering. It's a tough balance between making a personal decision and potentially stigmatizing autism.\n\nThe wife's reaction is also a factor. She feels the author is being selfish. It's important to note that the decision is between the couple, and they might have different views on family planning. The author's stance is about not wanting to risk another child's quality of life, while the wife might see the decision as not wanting to face future challenges together.\n\nIn the end, whether it's right or wrong might depend on perspectives. Some might think it's a valid parental choice to avoid potential suffering, while others might see it as an overgeneralization. Since the question is about being an asshole (AITA), the community would likely consider if the author is being unreasonable. Given the context, the author's concerns are based on real challenges, so they might not be in the wrong.\n"
