Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a parent who found out their son has autism and now doesn't want to have a second child, fearing the next child might have similar or worse challenges. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is making a personal decision based on their current child's health and their own experiences. They're considering the potential hardships a second child might face, including autism and other health issues. The wife thinks the author is being selfish, but the author feels the opposite, believing they're making a responsible choice.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user is asking for my judgment based on the information provided.\n\nI should consider the ethical aspects here. On one hand, the author is prioritizing their son's well-being and considering the potential future children's quality of life. On the other, having children is a personal choice, and others might argue that it's not their place to decide the worth of another life. However, the author is not making that decision for anyone else; they're choosing not to have another child based on their assessment of the risks and challenges.\n\nThe author mentions the current child's significant challenges: sleep issues, health problems, and autism. They're concerned about the genetic or environmental factors that might contribute to another child having similar issues. It's a personal decision that involves their family's capacity to handle additional stress and the potential suffering of a future child.\n\nThe wife's perspective is that the author is being selfish and spiteful. But the author is acting out of love and a desire to avoid further hardship. While it's true that some might view it as selfish to avoid the risk, others might see it as a responsible choice given the existing difficulties.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, having children is often seen as a positive, but the author is making a choice based on practical and emotional considerations. The AITA (Am I the Asshole?) aspect often looks at whether the person's actions are hurtful to others. Here, the author is making a personal decision that doesn't directly harm others; it's about their own family planning.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that autism is a spectrum, and while some people face significant challenges, others have fulfilling lives. The author's assumption that a second child would have a worse experience is a projection. But that's their personal concern based on their current experience.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is making a decision based on their current family's situation and their own capacity to handle additional challenges. While the wife disagrees, the decision is ultimately personal. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
