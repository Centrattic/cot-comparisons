Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for deciding not to have a second child because their first son has autism. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author found out their son has autism, which was confirmed by a specialist. The son has significant challenges: sleep issues, eczema, allergies, and being a difficult child. The author is concerned that another child might have similar issues and doesn't want to bring another child into such hardship. The wife disagrees, thinking the author is selfish.\n\nNow, the key points here are the author's reasoning. They don't want to have another child because of the potential for similar struggles. The author feels it's selfish to do so, while the wife thinks they're being selfish by not wanting another child. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, decisions about having children are deeply personal. The author is making a choice based on their current experiences and the well-being of their family. They're considering the possible hardships the next child might face, not just for the child but also for the family's capacity to handle another child with similar needs.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that autism is a spectrum, and not all autistic individuals have the same level of challenges. The author is making an assumption that another child would have as hard a life as their son, but that's not guaranteed. Also, the decision to have a child is a big one, and the author is prioritizing the potential child's well-being, which can be seen as a responsible stance.\n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that it's not fair to assume all autistic people have a hard life. Autism comes with its own set of strengths and challenges, and many lead fulfilling lives. The author's perspective could be based on their specific experiences rather than a general understanding of autism. Additionally, the wife's perspective might be that they can handle another child, regardless of potential challenges, perhaps viewing it as a family decision rather than a personal choice based on fear.\n\nBut in terms of the author's intentions, they're not acting out of malice. They love their son and are concerned about the next child's quality of life. The decision is based on their current capacity and the existing hardships they face. Society often has conflicting views on this matter; some may see the author as making a responsible choice, while others might think that not wanting to have another child based on a possible condition is premature or biased.\n\nSo, considering all angles, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the values one prioritizes. If the focus is on the potential child's well-being and the family's ability to provide adequate care, the author's decision is understandable. However, if the emphasis is on not making assumptions about future children's experiences or the potential for a good life despite autism, then the author's stance might be seen as problematic. But given the information provided, the author's reasoning seems rooted in concern for their family's situation rather than selfishness. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B, not in the wrong, but it's a nuanced issue.\n"
