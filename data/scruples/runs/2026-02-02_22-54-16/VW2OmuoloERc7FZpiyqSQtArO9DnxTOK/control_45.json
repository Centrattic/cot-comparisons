Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting to have a second child because their first child is autistic. The options are A (in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a parent whose son has autism, with additional challenges like sleep issues, allergies, and eczema. They feel that bringing another child into the world with similar hardships would be selfish. However, their wife disagrees, calling them selfish and spiteful.\n\nAutism is a spectrum condition, and it's important to note that each individual's experience is unique. The decision here is complex. On one hand, the parent is expressing concern for the well-being of a potential future child, considering the possible challenges they might face. On the other hand, their decision could be seen as making assumptions about the quality of life for someone with autism, which might not account for the individual's own perspective and the support they receive.\n\nThe parent's reasoning includes the idea that they don't want another child to have a hard life, which could be viewed as well-intentioned. However, some might argue that this is a form of ableism, which is discrimination in favor of people who are not disabled. Assuming that someone with autism has a lower quality of life ignores the fact that many autistic individuals lead fulfilling lives, and that society's attitudes and support systems play a significant role in their well-being. \n\nAdditionally, the parent is making a decision based on their own experiences with their son, but they don't know for sure that another child would have the same conditions. It's also important to consider that having another child might provide support and companionship for the first child, which could be beneficial for both.\n\nThe parent's wife's reaction suggests that she values having a second child regardless of potential challenges, which is a valid perspective. The conflict here is between personal comfort and family planning versus societal expectations and potential support for the existing child.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the parent is prioritizing the potential future child's well-being over their own desire for another child. But there's a risk of projecting their own hardships onto the potential child. It's also worth noting that the decision to have children is a personal one, and while others might disagree, it's not inherently wrong unless it's causing direct harm.\n\nHowever, the key point here is whether the parent is being selfish or making a reasonable decision. The parent's concern is about the child's quality of life, but this can be seen as a form of eugenics thinking, which is problematic. It's important to challenge the assumption that certain conditions automatically lead to a worse life. \n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intentions might be to protect a future child, their reasoning could be considered harmful because it devalues the life of someone with autism. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (in the wrong), but this is a nuanced issue.\n"
