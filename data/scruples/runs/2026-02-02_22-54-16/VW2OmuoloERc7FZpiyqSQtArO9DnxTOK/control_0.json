Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they have an autistic son with various challenges, and the author doesn't want to have a second child because they don't want another child to go through similar hardships. The wife thinks they're being selfish, but the author thinks they're being responsible.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is making a personal decision based on their current experiences. They love their son but are concerned about the potential suffering of a future child. Is it wrong to not want to have another child because of genetic or environmental risks? That's a big question.\n\nAutism is a spectrum, and while some people with autism face challenges, others lead fulfilling lives. The author is generalizing that another child might have an equally hard life, but that's not necessarily the case. Also, having a child is a big decision, and parents do consider various factors like health, resources, etc. So maybe the author isn't wrong for prioritizing the well-being of a potential future child.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife thinks the author is being selfish. But is it selfish to avoid bringing a child into a situation where they might face hardships? Or is it actually a responsible decision? There's also the aspect of not wanting to limit the first child's resources or attention. But the author isn't making that argument; they're focusing on the potential child's well-being.\n\nI should also consider that the author's reasoning is based on their current experiences. They might not be considering that autism can come with strengths and that support can make a difference. But that doesn't automatically make their decision wrong. It's their choice to make, even if others disagree.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If being \"in the wrong\" means acting selfishly or irresponsibly, then maybe not. They're making a personal choice based on their values and circumstances. However, others might see it differently, but the question is whether they're objectively wrong. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the decision is subjective and based on their perspective on what's best.\n"
