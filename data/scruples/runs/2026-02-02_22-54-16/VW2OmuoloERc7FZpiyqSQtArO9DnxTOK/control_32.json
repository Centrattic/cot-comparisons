Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they found out their son has autism and they don't want another child because of the potential for another child to have similar or worse challenges. Their wife is upset, calling them selfish, but the author feels the opposite.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasoning. They mention their son has autism, which comes with various difficulties like sleep issues, allergies, eczema, and behavioral challenges. They're worried about bringing another child into the world who might face similar or worse problems. The author is basing this on their current experience and the desire to prevent another child from suffering. They argue it's not selfish but rather a protective stance.\n\nOn the other hand, their wife thinks they're being selfish. The key question here is whether it's morally acceptable to decide against having another child based on the possibility of that child having disabilities. Some might argue that life is inherently challenging for everyone in different ways, and it's not for one parent to decide another's quality of life. Others might support the author's decision, considering the specific challenges they're already facing and wanting to avoid replicating those difficulties.\n\nAutism is a spectrum, and many individuals with autism lead fulfilling lives. The author's concerns might be influenced by their current stress and the specific challenges of their son. However, generalizing that a future child would have the same or worse issues could be a leap. There's also the aspect of genetic factors\u2014autism can have hereditary components, but it's not guaranteed.\n\nThe author's decision might be seen as a personal choice based on their family's circumstances. However, some ethical perspectives argue that it's not for parents to decide whether someone else can have a good life, even if they have disabilities. The author is prioritizing their own ability to provide care and their perception of the child's well-being, which could be viewed as a valid personal decision, but others might see it as making a judgment about lives with disabilities.\n\nI need to weigh these points. The author isn't making a decision based on the child's race, religion, or other factors, but on potential health and developmental challenges. There's also the aspect of not wanting to subject another child to similar hardships they're already experiencing. However, the decision to have children is deeply personal, and the author is acting on their own values and experiences.\n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" if the question is about being selfish versus making a thoughtful decision, it's subjective. But from a moral standpoint, some might argue that it's not selfish to consider the well-being of a future child and one's own capacity to provide care. Others might say it's limiting the possibilities for another child who could thrive despite challenges.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer hinges on whether the author's reasoning is seen as selfish or a responsible decision based on their family's situation. Different people might have different opinions here, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for making a choice that reflects their values and current circumstances.\n"
