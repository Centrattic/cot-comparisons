Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting a second child because their son has autism. The author feels it's selfish to bring another child into such hardship, while the wife thinks the author is being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author is making a decision based on their son's experiences. They've seen the challenges with autism, sleep issues, health problems, and the potential for bullying. Their reasoning is that they don't want another child to face similar struggles. \n\nOn the other hand, deciding not to have another child based on genetic predisposition is a personal choice. But is it wrong? Well, autonomy in reproductive decisions is a key point. The author isn't forcing anyone; they're choosing not to have another child. However, the issue could be how they phrase their reasoning, implying that bringing a child with autism is inherently a bad outcome. That might come across as devaluing people with autism.\n\nAlso, the author's wife thinks they're being selfish. There's a balance between personal beliefs and respecting the partner's wishes. The author might not be wrong in their decision, but their justification could be problematic if it stigmatizes autism. The key is whether the author's stance is harmful. If they're making a personal choice without imposing on others, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if their reasoning contributes to ableism, then there might be an issue.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the decision is ethically permissible. Since it's their choice, and they're not acting against others' interests except their partner's, it's debatable. However, the way they frame autism as a negative outcome might be where they're in the wrong. But the question is about being in the wrong in the situation, not the framing. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because it's their right to decide, even if their reasoning is flawed.\n"
