Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for deciding not to have a second child after their first son is diagnosed with autism. The options are A (yes, they are in the wrong) or B (no, they aren't). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments presented. The author mentions that their son has autism, which comes with significant challenges: sleep issues, health problems, and the potential for bullying. They're concerned about bringing another child into the world who might face similar or worse struggles. They love their son but feel it's selfish to risk another child having a hard life.\n\nNow, to determine if they're in the wrong, I should think about ethical perspectives. Autistic individuals themselves often reject the idea that autism is a tragedy, emphasizing neurodiversity and the value of different experiences. The author might not see autism as a negative, but the parent is worried about the child's quality of life. However, the decision to have children is deeply personal. Choosing not to have another child based on concerns about potential disabilities isn't inherently selfish. It's about parental judgment of what's best for the child and the family's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, critics might argue that the author is making a judgment about the value of autistic lives and that their fear of challenges is a reason not to have another child, which could be seen as a cop-out from the difficulties. But the author isn't rejecting their son; they love him. It's more about not wanting to add to potential suffering.\n\nAnother angle: the wife thinks the author is being selfish. That suggests family conflict, but the question is about whether the author is in the wrong morally or ethically, not in the relationship. Societal views vary, but in many contexts, people have the right to choose family size based on their circumstances.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Their decision is based on their assessment of their ability to care for another child and their desire to prevent potential suffering. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
