Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting a second child because their first son has autism. The question is from the \"Am I the Asshole?\" subreddit, which is where people go to get opinions on whether they're being unreasonable in a situation.\n\nThe author's son was diagnosed with autism, and he has other issues like sleep problems, eczema, and allergies. The author feels that bringing another child into the world, who might have similar challenges, would be selfish. The wife thinks the author is being an asshole, but he thinks he's being responsible.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is making a personal decision based on his family's current situation. He's concerned about the potential suffering of another child and the family's ability to cope. But is it his right to decide not to have another child based on possible genetic factors? Also, autism is a spectrum, and not all autistic individuals have the same level of difficulty. The author might be generalizing based on his son's experience.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is considering the well-being of a future child, which is a valid concern. However, deciding not to have a child because of the possibility of autism could be seen as discriminatory. Autism is a part of some people's identities, and many autistic individuals and their advocates argue that it's not a curse but a different way of being. The author's reasoning might reflect ableism, assuming that a life with autism is inherently worse.\n\nAlso, the author's wife's perspective is important. She might see having another child as a positive step, and his decision could affect their relationship. But the question is about the author's wrongdoing, not the wife's.\n\nThe key points are: the author's fear of potential suffering, the assumption that another child would have similar issues, and the ethical implications of making such a decision. The answer depends on whether the decision is based on valid concerns or harmful stereotypes.\n\nIn summary, while the author's concerns are real and valid for his family, the reasoning that autism makes a life \"bad\" or that it's selfish to have another child could be considered misguided. The answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because of the potential ableism, but some might argue B (not in the wrong) as it's a personal choice.\n"
