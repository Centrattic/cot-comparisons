Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for deciding not to have a second child after their first son was diagnosed with autism. The author lists several challenges their son faces, including autism, sleep issues, eczema, allergies, and the stress it's putting on their family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects here. The key point is the author's decision based on concerns about their future child potentially having similar or worse conditions. The author feels it's selfish to bring another child into such a difficult situation, while the wife disagrees.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, people have the right to make reproductive choices based on their circumstances. The author isn't making a decision out of malice but out of concern for the child's well-being and their family's ability to cope. However, it's important to note that autism is a spectrum and varies widely in how it affects individuals. The author's experience with their son might influence their perception, possibly leading to a negative view of autism that doesn't account for the positive aspects of neurodiversity.\n\nThe author mentions that their son is \"a handful\" and the family's sleep deprivation, which are real challenges. Deciding not to have another child due to these factors is a personal choice. However, there's a risk of stigmatizing autism by framing it as a \"burden\" or a \"life as hard,\" which might overlook the individual's potential for a fulfilling life with support.\n\nThe wife's reaction suggests there's a disagreement in the couple about this decision. It's possible that the wife sees the value in having another child regardless of potential challenges, while the author is more cautious. The author's stance could be seen as prioritizing the potential child's quality of life, but others might argue that parents should be ready to support any child they have, regardless of challenges.\n\nLegally, there's no wrongdoing here. The decision to have children is personal. Ethically, it's more nuanced. The author isn't discriminating against a specific group but is making a choice based on their family's specific circumstances and experiences. However, the way they frame autism as something inherently negative could be problematic, as it might contribute to stigma.\n\nIn summary, the author's decision is a personal one based on their current experiences and fears. While others might challenge their reasoning, especially regarding the perception of autism, the decision itself isn't ethically wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
