Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given text is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's son was diagnosed with autism, and he doesn't want to have another child because he thinks the next child might have similar or worse challenges. His wife thinks he's being selfish and an asshole, but he feels the opposite and is seeking validation.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The author is making a personal decision based on his experience with his son's condition. He's concerned about the potential quality of life for another child. The question is whether this decision is morally wrong. \n\nAutism is a spectrum, so not all autistic individuals have the same level of difficulty. The author is assuming that another child might have a similar or worse experience, which could be a leap. But is it fair to judge him for his personal choice? On one hand, people have the right to make decisions about their family based on their circumstances. On the other hand, some might argue that it's prejudging a potential future child based on a sibling's experience, which might not be the same.\n\nThe author mentions the challenges: lack of sleep, physical health issues, and the social difficulties he observed with other autistic kids. He loves his son but is worried about the possible hardships. Is it selfish to not want to bring a child into a potentially difficult life? That's a philosophical question. \n\nIn some ethical frameworks, the idea of procreation ethics might weigh in. For example, if a child's life would be \"worth living,\" is it okay to have them? But since autism is a part of a person's identity, some argue that it's not a disability that should be avoided. The author's perspective might be influenced by his own understanding and the stress he's experiencing with his current child. \n\nHowever, the decision to have children is deeply personal. The author is not choosing between children based on disability; he's considering his family's capacity to handle additional challenges. The wife's reaction is also part of the dynamic here\u2014different values and perspectives can lead to conflict. \n\nI should also consider the concept of \"antisocialism\" in ethics, which is the idea that it's wrong to bring children into the world if their lives would be worse. The author might be following that reasoning. But others might counter that autism can bring joy and that the author's view is based on stereotypes. \n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on how one views personal choice versus potential harm. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer hinges on moral and ethical perspectives. I need to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). Given the complexity and the right to make personal decisions, I might lean towards B, but it's not straightforward.\n"
