Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for deciding not to have a second child after discovering their first son has autism.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's son has been diagnosed with autism, and there are other challenges like sleep issues, eczema, and allergies. The author feels that bringing another child into the world might mean another child with similar or worse difficulties, which they consider selfish. The wife thinks the author is being selfish and spiteful, but he feels the opposite.\n\nNow, the key points here are about parental choice, perceived selfishness, and the ethical implications of not wanting another child based on the first child's condition. The author is making a personal decision based on their experiences and the potential future of another child. \n\nIn terms of ethics, people often have different views. From one angle, the author is prioritizing the child's potential well-being, which could be seen as responsible. On the other hand, others might argue that it's making assumptions about what another child's life would be like and that autism doesn't define a person's quality of life. Also, the decision could be seen as based on fear or a lack of understanding of what life with autism entails. \n\nThe author mentions that they love their son deeply, which suggests their decision isn't malicious. However, the wife's perspective is that the author is being selfish. This could be because the author is making a choice that affects their family dynamics and the wife's wishes. \n\nI should consider if there's a societal expectation that one should have more children regardless of challenges. But the author is making a personal choice based on their specific circumstances. There's also the aspect of genetic factors. Autism can have a hereditary component, but it's not guaranteed. The author is making a decision based on probability, which some might see as reasonable, while others might see it as overcautious.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is \"in the wrong,\" it's a matter of moral judgment. If the question is about whether they're being selfish or harmful, it's subjective. The author is not harming anyone by choosing not to have another child. However, the wife's reaction is part of the conflict. The author's reasoning is based on their perception of the child's potential suffering, which is a personal value judgment.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether making a choice based on perceived future challenges is considered selfish or self-protective. Since the author is making a decision that aligns with their own values and experiences, even if others disagree, they aren't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
