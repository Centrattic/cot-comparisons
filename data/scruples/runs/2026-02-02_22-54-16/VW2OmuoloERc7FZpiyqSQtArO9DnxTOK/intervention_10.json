Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for deciding not to have a second child because their first son is autistic. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person found out their son is autistic and has other challenges like sleep issues, eczema, allergies. They feel that bringing another child into the world with similar difficulties would be selfish. The wife thinks the person is being selfish and an asshole, but the person feels they're being responsible.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know my opinion. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, choosing not to have another child based on potential health issues might be seen as a personal decision. On the other, autism is a part of neurodiversity, and not all autistic people have the same level of difficulty. Also, there's the ethical angle of whether it's right to make such a decision based on potential future challenges.\n\nBut wait, the key here is the person's reasoning. They're concerned about bringing a child into a life with potential hardships. Some might argue that it's not their place to decide another child's life quality, and that they could provide support. Others might see it as a valid choice to consider one's capacity to care for multiple children, especially with existing challenges.\n\nThe person's feelings of being responsible rather than selfish are their own perspective. However, the wife's reaction suggests a conflict in values. The question is whether the decision is morally wrong. In terms of ethics, there's no one-size-fits-all answer. Some people believe that parents should not make decisions based on potential disabilities, while others respect the decision to prioritize family well-being.\n\nAlso, autism itself isn't a curse; it's a spectrum with varying degrees of support needs. The person is making a choice based on their experience with their son, but that might not account for the possibility of a different outcome with another child. However, the decision is ultimately personal and based on their current situation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer hinges on personal ethics and societal views. Since the decision is a personal choice and not inherently harmful to others (except for the wife's feelings), it's a matter of perspective. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're making a difficult decision based on their circumstances and feelings. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
