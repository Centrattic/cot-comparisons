Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting a second child because their first son is autistic. The question is whether the author's reasoning is valid or not.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his wife have a son with autism, diagnosed by a specialist. The son has sleep issues, physical health problems, and the author is concerned that a second child might have similar or worse challenges. The author feels it's selfish to bring another child into such hardship. The wife disagrees, thinking he's being selfish and spiteful.\n\nThe author is asking if he's the asshole (AITA). The user says they think the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide if the author is wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nAutism is a neurodevelopmental condition. It's a spectrum, so it varies in how it affects individuals. Some people with autism have significant challenges, while others live independently. The author's son has multiple issues\u2014autism, sleep problems, eczema, allergies. That's a lot for any family to handle.\n\nThe author's reasoning is based on the potential for the next child to have similar or worse issues. But does that make him selfish? Well, parents often consider the well-being of their children when deciding to have more. The author is prioritizing the potential child's quality of life, thinking it's unfair to subject another child to similar hardships.\n\nHowever, there's a counterargument here. Autism is not a curse or a disease to be avoided. Many autistic people and their advocates argue that autism is part of neurodiversity and that society should support autistic individuals better rather than prevent them from existing. The author's view that autism makes life \"as hard as\" his son's might be biased. Also, bringing another child into the world doesn't guarantee similar issues; genetics are complex.\n\nThe author mentions that he loves his son but is hesitant for the next child's sake. That shows he's not rejecting his son but is concerned about replicating the situation. But is it ethical to decide not to have a child based on genetic risk? Some might say it's a personal choice, others might see it as a form of eugenics, though the author isn't trying to eliminate a condition, just avoiding potential suffering.\n\nThe wife's reaction (\"selfish and spiteful\") could stem from feeling that the author is dismissing the possibility of a positive experience with another child, or that he's undermining the support they can provide. Maybe the wife is more optimistic about managing the challenges or believes that the potential for a fulfilling relationship with a new child outweighs the risks.\n\nAlso, the author's son has other issues besides autism (eczema, allergies), which might not be hereditary. The author is conflating multiple factors, not just autism. So even if autism isn't the only concern, the author's decision is based on a combination of health issues.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the right to choose not to have children is generally considered a personal right. Parents have autonomy in family planning decisions. However, the argument against the author is that it's presumptuous to believe that a future child's life would be worse because of autism, and that the potential child might not share the same traits. Additionally, support systems and societal progress can improve the lives of autistic individuals.\n\nSo, where does this leave the author? If he's making a decision based on his current understanding and experiences, it's a personal choice. However, the judgment of whether he's in the wrong depends on societal views on disability and the ethics of procreation. If the community sees it as selfish to avoid bringing a child into a potentially challenging life, then maybe A. If it's seen as a valid personal choice, then B.\n\nIn the context of the AITA question, the community often considers intentions and perspective. The author is expressing concern for the potential child's well-being, which is a valid concern. However, some might argue that the author is making a judgment about the quality of life for autistic individuals without considering their own perspectives (as many autistic people are happy with their lives). But the author isn't denying that his son has a good life, just worried about the challenges.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the decision is personal. The author isn't in the wrong for making a choice based on his family's circumstances and his beliefs about the potential child's quality of life. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
