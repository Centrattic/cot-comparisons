Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting another child due to their autistic son's challenges. The user initially thinks the author isn't, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The father's son has autism, which is confirmed by a specialist. The son has significant challenges: sleep issues, health problems, eczema, allergies. The father is worried that a second child might also have autism or similar difficulties, making life hard. He loves his son but doesn't want to bring another child into such a difficult situation. The wife thinks he's selfish, but he feels the opposite.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether it's wrong to not want another child because of the existing child's autism. From an ethical standpoint, people have the right to make decisions about their family size based on their circumstances. However, some might argue that it's discriminatory to not want a child because of potential disabilities. But others might see it as a personal choice based on the family's ability to cope.\n\nAutism is a spectrum, and while one child might have autism, another child from the same parents might not. The father is expressing concern about the quality of life for another child. However, it's also important to note that some people with autism lead fulfilling lives with support. The father's decision could be seen as a way to avoid potential suffering, but it's also avoiding the responsibility of caring for another child with similar needs.\n\nThe wife's reaction suggests she feels the decision is based on ableism, thinking it's wrong to not want another child because of potential disability. The father's motivation is to prevent potential suffering, but others might argue that life with autism isn't inherently less valuable and that the decision is based on the family's ability to handle it, not the intrinsic worth of the child.\n\nLegally, the father isn't violating any laws by choosing not to have another child. Ethically, it's a gray area. It's a personal choice, but it's also important to consider the societal implications of valuing children based on their abilities. However, the father's decision is based on his personal experience and the challenges they're facing.\n\nIn conclusion, whether it's right or wrong is subjective. The father is making a choice based on his family's situation. There's no absolute right or wrong here. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on one's ethical perspective. If we consider that people have the right to make family decisions based on their capacity, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the decision is seen as discriminatory against autistic individuals, then it might be considered wrong. Since the father is not making a judgment about autism itself but about the family's ability to cope, it's more about personal circumstances. So the answer would be B: No.\n"
