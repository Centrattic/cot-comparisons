Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they found out their young son has autism and related health issues, and they don't want to have a second child because they don't want another child to go through the same struggles. Their wife thinks they're being selfish, but the author feels the opposite.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition, and while it's not a disease, it can come with challenges. The author mentions their son has sleep issues, eczema, allergies, and autism. These are all significant challenges for a family to manage. The author is expressing concern about potentially bringing another child into a situation where they might inherit similar or worse conditions. \n\nThe question is whether the author is being selfish or not. The key points here are the author's reasons for not wanting another child. They love their son but are concerned about the quality of life for another child. They also mention seeing a child with autism being bullied, so they're worried about the social challenges.\n\nOn one hand, the decision not to have another child is a personal one. People have various reasons for family planning, and health concerns are valid. It's not uncommon for couples to consider medical issues when deciding about having more children. The author isn't making a judgment about autism itself but is focused on the potential hardships another child might face. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is making assumptions about the future child's life. Not all autistic individuals have the same challenges; some may have a better quality of life with support. Also, the author's concern about the child being bullied might not be entirely within their control. However, the author is making a choice based on their current family situation and what they believe they can provide.\n\nThe wife's reaction is important too. She sees the author as selfish, but the author believes they're acting in the best interest of a future child. The line between self-preservation and selfishness can be blurry here. If the author is making a decision to protect a future child from potential suffering, that could be seen as an act of love or as being overly cautious.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's no right or wrong answer, but the author's intentions seem genuine. They're not dismissing autism but are concerned about the possible hardships. Decisions about having children are deeply personal, and considering health factors is part of that. So, I think the author is within their rights to decide not to have another child based on these concerns.\n"
