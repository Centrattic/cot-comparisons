Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not wanting another child due to autism. The author's son has autism and other issues like sleep problems, eczema, allergies. The author feels bringing another child into such a hard life is selfish. The wife thinks he's being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author is making a personal decision based on their family's experiences. They love their son but are worried about the potential hardships another child might face if they also have autism or similar issues. But is it wrong to not want another child because of these concerns?\n\nAutism is a spectrum, and having one child with autism doesn't mean another will have the same level of difficulty. The author is generalizing, assuming another child would have a similarly hard life. But that's not necessarily true. Also, the author's reasoning is to prevent the child from suffering, but children with autism can lead fulfilling lives with the right support. The author's perspective might stem from personal stress and lack of sleep, which could cloud their judgment.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concerns are valid in terms of the family's capacity to care for another child. They mention physical and emotional strains. However, deciding not to have another child based on the possibility of the child's challenges isn't inherently selfish. It's a personal choice about family planning. But is it wrong? The question is whether the author's reasoning is flawed.\n\nThe key points: The author is making a decision based on their current child's challenges. The wife disagrees, calling him selfish. The author feels it's responsible to avoid potential suffering. But others might argue that life's unpredictability should be accepted, and not having another child is a personal choice, not wrong. However, the author's reasoning could be seen as underestimating the child's potential and overestimating the hardships. Also, the decision is based on fear of the unknown rather than concrete information.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's complex. The author is prioritizing their family's well-being, which is understandable. But is it wrong to not want another child because of existing challenges? It depends on cultural values and personal beliefs. Some might say it's not wrong to make such a decision, while others might think everyone should try to have another child, which isn't necessarily the case.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's reasoning is considered selfish. The author isn't harming anyone by choosing not to have another child. They are expressing a personal decision based on their circumstances. The wife might feel rejected or dismissed, but the author isn't in the wrong for having different feelings. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong), but I need to be careful here.\n"
