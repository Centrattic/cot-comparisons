Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The author found out their son has autism and now doesn't want a second child because they think the next child might also be autistic and have similar difficulties.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is making a decision based on their son's diagnosis and the challenges they're facing. They mention sleep deprivation, medical issues like eczema and allergies, and concerns about bullying. The key point is whether it's selfish to not want another child because of the possibility of autism.\n\nAutism is a spectrum disorder, and while it's possible for siblings to share similar traits, it's not guaranteed. The author is worried about the child's potential quality of life and their own ability to cope. They love their son, but the decision is about not wanting to bring another child into a situation that might be equally challenging.\n\nNow, considering \"AITA\" standards, the community often evaluates whether the person's actions are morally wrong or selfish. The author is expressing a personal choice based on their experiences. While their reasoning might be controversial, the question is if they're in the wrong. \n\nSome might argue that the author is being discriminatory by associating autism with a \"hard life.\" Others might say it's a valid concern given the current challenges. However, the decision to have children is deeply personal, and the author is not acting in a way that directly harms others. They're sharing their honest feelings with their wife, even though she disagrees.\n\nThe author isn't making a decision about their son's worth but about their own capacity to handle another child with similar needs. While their wife feels they're being selfish, the author's perspective is about their own emotional and physical readiness. So, the answer would likely be B (No), as they are not in the wrong for making a personal choice based on their circumstances.\n"
