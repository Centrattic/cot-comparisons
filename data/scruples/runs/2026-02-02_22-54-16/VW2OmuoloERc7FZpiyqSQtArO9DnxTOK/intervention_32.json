Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The author is questioning their decision not to have a second child after their first son was diagnosed with autism. They mention the challenges their son faces, including sleep issues, medical conditions, and the potential for their next child to have similar or worse difficulties. The wife is upset, calling the author selfish and spiteful, but the author feels they're making the right choice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is making a personal decision based on their experience and the potential risks for another child. Autism is a spectrum, and while it can present challenges, it's not inherently a bad thing. The author's concerns about the child's well-being and the family's ability to cope are valid, but is it wrong to make that choice? \n\nAutism is often misunderstood. Some people with autism lead fulfilling lives, and the societal challenges (like bullying) can be mitigated with support. The author might be projecting their son's specific struggles onto a future child, which might not be accurate. However, the decision to have children is deeply personal, and people have the right to consider their circumstances.\n\nThe author's wife is upset because she sees the decision as selfish. But the author's reasoning is about the potential child's quality of life, not their own desires. It's important to distinguish between selfishness and making a hard choice based on anticipated challenges. The author is also considering their son's experience, which shows they care about the well-being of any future children.\n\nIn terms of ethics, is it wrong to avoid having a child if there's a risk of disability? This is a complex issue. Some argue that it's not the parent's place to decide the value of a potential life, while others believe parents have the right to make such decisions based on what they believe is best for the child and their family.\n\nThe author is not making a judgment about autism itself but about the likelihood of another child facing similar challenges. It's a personal choice, and while others might disagree, it doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. The key is whether they are acting out of self-interest versus concern for the child. The author claims the latter, which is a valid consideration.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the decision is based on the parent's assessment of their family's circumstances and the potential child's well-being, even if others disagree.\n"
