Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for not wanting a second child after their first child is diagnosed with autism. The author feels it's selfish to bring another child into such hardship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family is already dealing with significant challenges: their son has autism, sleep issues, eczema, allergies, and the parents are sleep-deprived. The author is worried that another child might have similar or worse difficulties. They feel it's unfair to the potential child and don't want to \"roll the dice.\"\n\nOn one hand, deciding not to have another child is a personal choice. The author is prioritizing the well-being of a future child, which could be seen as thoughtful. Autism doesn't define a person's quality of life, and many lead fulfilling lives. However, the author's reasoning might stem from fear or misunderstanding about autism. The specialist's quick diagnosis might not fully capture the spectrum's variability. Also, the author mentions that others with autism were bullied, but that's not an inevitable outcome with proper support.\n\nThe wife feels the author is being selfish and spiteful. It's important to consider both perspectives. The author's concern for the child's future is valid, but dismissing the possibility of a positive outcome purely based on the first child's experience might be hasty. Every child is unique, and while there's a genetic component to autism, it's not a certainty. Additionally, the family's situation might improve with resources and support.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a complex issue. Choosing not to have another child is a personal decision. However, the author's framing of autism as inherently negative and the assumption that another child would face the same hardships could be seen as misunderstanding the diversity of the autism spectrum. The author might benefit from more information and counseling to explore their feelings. But ultimately, it's their choice, and they're prioritizing potential future well-being, which isn't inherently wrong. Still, the way they express their feelings might overlook the positive aspects and the support systems available. So, maybe they're not in the wrong, but their reasoning could use more nuance.\n"
