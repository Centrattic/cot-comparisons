Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for deciding not to have a second child due to their son's autism. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a son with autism, who has multiple challenges: sleep issues, health problems, and the stress of caring for him. The author is worried that a second child might have similar issues, so they don't want to have another child. The wife is upset, thinking the author is selfish.\n\nSo, the key here is whether the author's decision is selfish or not. The author is making a choice based on their family's circumstances. They love their son but are concerned about the potential hardships another child might face. \n\nAutism is a spectrum, and while there's a genetic component, it's not guaranteed that another child would have autism. However, the author is considering the possibility. The author's reasoning is that bringing a child into a situation with potential hardships is selfish. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that every child has challenges, and by not having another child, the author is avoiding responsibility. But the author's decision is based on their current experiences and a desire to prevent suffering. They're also considering the existing strain on their family, like the sleep deprivation and health issues. \n\nThe author isn't making a judgment about autism itself but is making a personal choice based on their family's well-being. The wife's reaction is that the author is being selfish, but the author feels it's the right decision. \n\nI think the author's stance is a personal choice. They are not forcing anyone; they are choosing their family's path based on their circumstances. It's a difficult decision, and while some may disagree, it's not inherently wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
