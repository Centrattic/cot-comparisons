Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that they have a son diagnosed with autism and they don't want to have another child because they don't want another child to go through similar struggles. The question is whether this makes them the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author is expressing concern for the potential suffering of another child. They mention their own son's challenges\u2014autism, sleep issues, allergies, eczema. They feel that bringing another child into such a situation is selfish. They also note that they love their son but are making a decision based on not wanting to repeat the hardships.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife thinks the author is being selfish and spiteful. Others might argue that it's not fair to assume another child would have the same issues, and that deciding against another child based on the possibility of similar challenges is a personal choice. However, some might see it as a failure to embrace the unknown or to accept that all children come with their own set of challenges.\n\nAutism is a spectrum, and while the son has autism, it's not a guaranteed trait that another child would have the same. The author is making a decision based on their current experiences, but it's a personal choice. The ethical aspect here is whether it's acceptable to decide not to have more children based on the potential for similar hardships. There's no right or wrong in such a personal decision, but the perception of selfishness might come from others' expectations.\n\nThe author is not making a decision against another child because of the first child's needs but because of the potential for the next child to have similar issues. They are prioritizing the well-being of any future child. However, others might argue that this is a form of ableism, assuming that a life with autism is worse, or that avoiding bringing a child with potential challenges is selfish. But that's a complex ethical issue.\n\nIn many discussions, people's right to make personal reproductive choices is respected unless it causes harm to others. The author isn't harming anyone by choosing not to have another child. The wife's reaction might stem from differing views on family size and the challenges of raising children. The key here is whether the author's reasoning is considered selfish versus a responsible choice.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. It's their personal decision based on their experiences and what they're willing to commit to. They're not being cruel to their current son but making a choice for their future family. So the answer should be B.\n"
