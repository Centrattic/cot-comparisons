Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting a second child because their first son has autism. The author mentions that their son has autism, along with other challenges like eczema, allergies, and sleep issues. They feel it's selfish to bring another child into the world who might have similar or worse struggles. Their wife thinks they're being selfish, but the author feels the opposite.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author's decision is based on not wanting another child to suffer like their first. They love their son but are concerned about the potential quality of life for another child. On the other hand, deciding not to have a child based on potential genetic conditions touches on complex issues like eugenics and personal choice.\n\nAutism is a spectrum, and while some people face challenges, others lead fulfilling lives. The author might be assuming that another child would have the same level of difficulty, which isn't guaranteed. Also, the decision to have children is deeply personal. However, the argument against the author could be that they're projecting their son's specific struggles onto a future child, which might not be fair. Plus, the idea of choosing not to have a child based on potential health conditions can be seen as valuing some lives less than others.\n\nBut then again, parents have the right to consider their capabilities and resources. If they feel they can't provide adequate care for another child with similar needs, it's a valid concern. The key here is whether the author is being discriminatory. The author's reasoning is based on not wanting another child to suffer, not on the value of autistic lives. However, the underlying assumption that having autism is inherently a hardship might be problematic, as many autistic individuals and their advocates argue that autism is a natural variation, not a defect.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, they're making a personal choice based on their experiences. On the other, the decision could be seen as prejudging the potential quality of life for a future child. The answer might depend on cultural and personal values. Since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which usually implies a moral failing, the answer could be that the author isn't in the wrong because they're making a difficult choice, but the wife's perspective is also valid. However, the act of deciding against a child based on potential conditions can be viewed as ethically questionable by some. The final answer would need to weigh these factors.\n"
