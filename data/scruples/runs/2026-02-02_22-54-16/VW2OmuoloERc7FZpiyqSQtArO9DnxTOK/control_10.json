Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The author's main point is that they don't want to have a second child because their first son is autistic and has other health issues, and they don't want another child to go through similar struggles. Their wife is upset with them for being selfish, but the author feels they're being responsible.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects here. The author is expressing concern for the well-being of a potential future child. They mention sleep deprivation, health issues, and the challenges of having an autistic child. Their reasoning is that bringing another child into a situation that might be equally difficult is selfish. But is that actually selfish, or is it a valid personal choice based on their family's circumstances?\n\nAutism is a spectrum, and the author's son has significant challenges. The author is worried about the potential for another child to have similar or worse issues. However, it's important to note that autism isn't a curse or a punishment, and many autistic individuals live fulfilling lives. The author's decision might be based on fear or a lack of understanding about autism, or maybe they're projecting their current difficulties onto a possible future scenario.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention is to protect future children from hardship. But is it ethical to decide not to have another child based on the possibility of similar challenges? Also, the author's wife disagrees, which adds to the conflict. The author's stance could be seen as making a choice based on their own limitations rather than advocating for the needs of their existing child.\n\nAnother angle: The author's reasoning assumes that having autism or similar conditions automatically means a lower quality of life. But this is a controversial point. Some autistic people and their advocates argue that autism is a natural variation and not a disability that needs to be prevented. So, the author's decision might be based on stigma or misconceptions about autism.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that bringing a child into the world with potential hardships is selfish. However, isn't the decision not to have a child a personal one? While it's true that parents can't control their children's circumstances, deciding not to have another child based on the first child's challenges might be seen as avoiding responsibility or not supporting the possibility of a different outcome.\n\nThere's also the aspect of not wanting to bring another child into a home where resources and parental energy are already stretched thin. That could be a valid concern, but the author frames it as preventing suffering, which complicates the issue.\n\nIn terms of the \"asshole\" scale, the author isn't mistreating their current child or being cruel to their wife. They're expressing their feelings honestly, even if it's hurtful. However, by dismissing the possibility of a different future or underestimating the support available for a future child, they might be in the wrong. The key is whether the decision is based on selfishness or a genuine concern for the child's well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's reasoning might be flawed due to assumptions about autism and potential future challenges. While it's a personal decision, the underlying attitudes could be problematic. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to verify if there's a more nuanced perspective.\n"
