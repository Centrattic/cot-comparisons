Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for deciding not to have a second child after their first son is diagnosed with autism. They want a simple answer, A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points in the scenario. The author found out their son has autism, which isn't a surprise to them. They mention the son has multiple challenges: sleep issues, eczema, allergies, and the author is concerned about the next child potentially having similar or worse issues. The wife thinks the author is being selfish, but the author feels it's a responsible decision.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The question is about ethics and personal choice. In many cultures, having children is a personal decision, and parents have the right to decide based on their circumstances. The author is not making a value judgment about autism itself but is considering their family's ability to cope with additional challenges. They express love for their son but are concerned about the well-being of a future child.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is making assumptions about the potential second child's life quality and that autism is not inherently a burden. They might also say that the author is overestimating the challenges and underestimating their ability to support another child. On the other hand, the author's decision is based on their current experiences and a desire to avoid what they perceive as a difficult life for another child.\n\nLegally and ethically, parents have the right to make such decisions. The question of whether it's \"selfish\" is subjective. The author isn't harming anyone by choosing not to have another child. The wife's disagreement is a personal conflict but doesn't necessarily make the author wrong.\n\nConsidering all angles, the author's decision is a personal choice influenced by their experiences. Unless there's a legal or ethical violation, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
