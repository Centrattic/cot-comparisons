Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting another child because their first son has autism. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's son has autism and other challenges like sleep issues, eczema, allergies, and violent thrashing at night. They mention that the child is a handful and they get very little sleep. The author now doesn't want a second child, fearing another child might have similar or worse issues. The wife is upset, thinking the author is selfish.\n\nSo, the key points are the author's concern about the child's quality of life and their own ability to care for another child. The author loves their son but is worried about bringing another child into a situation that's hard. \n\nI should consider the ethics here. Is it wrong to not want another child because of existing challenges? On one hand, the parent is prioritizing the well-being of any future child, not wanting them to face similar struggles. On the other hand, some might argue that it's unfair to assume a future child would have the same issues, and that the decision is based on fear rather than the actual child's potential.\n\nAutism is a spectrum, and while there's a genetic component, it's not a guarantee. The author is making a choice based on their current child's experience, which is understandable. However, is it selfish? The author is not choosing to have a second child, so it's about their own capacity and values. They might be prioritizing quality of life for any future child. \n\nBut maybe the author is projecting their son's specific challenges onto a potential sibling. Also, the author mentions the child's bullying in school, so they're concerned about social aspects. The wife thinks the author is being selfish, but the author feels they're being responsible.\n\nIn terms of morality, there's no right or wrong, but societal views vary. Some might say it's the parent's right to make that choice, while others might think it's a valid concern. The key is whether the author is making a decision that's in their own family's best interest without forcing it on others. \n\nI think the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They're making a personal decision based on their experiences and concerns for the well-being of any future child. It's a hard decision, but it's their choice to make."
