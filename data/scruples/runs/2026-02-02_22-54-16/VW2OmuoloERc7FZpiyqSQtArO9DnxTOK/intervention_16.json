Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting a second child due to their son's autism. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his wife just found out their son has autism, which they were somewhat expecting. Their son has behavioral issues, sleep problems, health issues like eczema and allergies, and they're worried about another child having similar challenges. The wife thinks the author is being selfish, but he feels he's being responsible.\n\nAutism is a spectrum, so each child's experience can be different. Just because one child is autistic doesn't mean another will be, or if they are, it might not be as severe. The author's concern is about not wanting another child to face such hardships. Is this considered selfish? On one hand, parents often consider the well-being of future children, especially when there's a known condition. But on the other hand, making such a decision based on potential risks is a personal choice. \n\nThe author mentions that the specialist confirmed the autism, which might have genetic factors, but autism is multifactorial. The author's reasoning is that bringing a child into a world where they might face bullying and health issues is unfair. However, it's important to consider that having another child might come with its own set of challenges, but it's not necessarily the same. Also, the author's feelings are valid, but the assumption that another child would have a worse life is speculative. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is prioritizing the potential quality of life for a future child. But people with autism can lead fulfilling lives, especially with support. The author might be underestimating the resources and love they can provide. However, the decision to have a child is deeply personal, and feeling conflicted is natural. The key here is whether the author's stance is considered morally wrong. \n\nI think the answer hinges on the perspective. If the author is in the wrong (A), it's because he's making a judgment based on a possible scenario and not considering that another child might not have the same issues. If he's not in the wrong (B), it's because his concerns are genuine and based on his experiences. \n\nI need to check if there's a societal expectation that parents should have more children regardless of challenges. But in reality, parents are advised to do what's best for their family. The author might be feeling pressure, but his choice isn't necessarily wrong. Also, the wife's reaction is part of the dynamic, but the question is about whether he is in the wrong, not about their relationship conflict. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's decision is a personal one driven by his son's specific hardships. The potential for another child to have autism isn't guaranteed, and even if they do, their experiences could differ. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because he's acting on his genuine concerns and love for his son.\n"
