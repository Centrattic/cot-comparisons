Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not wanting another child after their son is diagnosed with autism. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his wife have a young son with autism, confirmed by a specialist. The son has multiple challenges: sleep issues, eczema, allergies, and the parents are exhausted. The author feels that bringing another child into the world, potentially with similar issues, would be selfish. The wife thinks he's being an asshole.\n\nSo, the core question is whether the author's decision is justified. The key points are the author's concern about the child's quality of life and the potential for another child to face similar hardships. The author loves his son but is hesitant to have another due to the risks involved.\n\nNow, considering ethical perspectives. On one hand, the author is making a personal choice based on his family's circumstances. He's considering the well-being of potential future children and the family's ability to manage. On the other hand, some might argue that it's discriminatory or that people with autism can lead fulfilling lives despite challenges.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is based on his experience with their current son's struggles. He's not making a judgment about autism in general but about the potential for another child to face similar hardships. The wife sees it as selfish, but the author feels it's responsible.\n\nI should also consider that the author isn't refusing treatment or support but is making a choice about family planning. The decision to have children is personal and can be influenced by many factors, including health, resources, and personal beliefs. The author is not denying the value of people with autism but is prioritizing the potential child's quality of life and the family's capacity to care.\n\nIn many cases, people choose not to have more children due to various challenges, like financial constraints, health issues, or lifestyle considerations. This scenario is similar but specific to autism. The author's stance isn't about autism itself but the combination of factors that make his current child's life difficult. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. It's a personal decision based on their unique situation. The answer would be B.\n"
