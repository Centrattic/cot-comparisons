Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting a second child after their son is diagnosed with autism. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parent found out their son has autism, which was confirmed by a specialist. The son has multiple challenges: sleep issues, physical health problems like eczema and allergies, and the parent is concerned about a future child having similar or worse issues. The parent feels it's selfish to bring another child into such a difficult situation, but their wife disagrees.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the parent is wrong for not wanting another child. I should consider both the arguments for and against. On one hand, the parent is making a personal choice based on their current experiences and the desire to avoid subjecting another child to similar hardships. On the other hand, the wife might feel betrayed or that the parent is being overly pessimistic about their ability to care for another child or about the future child's potential life.\n\nEthically, this is a complex issue. Personal autonomy and parental responsibility are key points. The parent's concern stems from their love for their son and not wanting another child to face similar struggles. However, others might argue that it's not the parent's place to decide another person's future happiness and that they might be underestimating their capacity to support another child, or that having a sibling could provide support. \n\nAlso, the parent mentions that autism is hereditary, but the decision to have another child is deeply personal. It's important to note that having a child with autism isn't a punishment, and parents can still choose based on their readiness and resources. \n\nThe parent's wife's feelings are valid too. If they previously wanted a second child, the sudden change might feel like a betrayal. But the parent is also being honest about their changed perspective. \n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? It's a matter of opinion, but from a neutral standpoint, making a decision based on personal circumstances and emotional readiness isn't inherently wrong. However, it's crucial to approach it with sensitivity and open communication. The parent isn't malicious; they're concerned. But their reasoning might be flawed in assuming another child would have the same problems or that the current situation is undesirable. \n\nIn the AITA context, the community often looks at intentions and fairness. The parent's intention is to protect potential future children from hardship, but they might not have considered that the next child could have a different experience. The wife might feel the parent is using their son's condition as an excuse, which could be seen as selfish. \n\nGiven the information, the answer could be A or B depending on perspective. But I think the parent's stance isn't necessarily wrong because they're making a choice based on their current understanding and capacity. However, the spouse's feelings are important, and the parent should consider that. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the parent is acting on their own values and not out of malice, I lean towards B (no), but need to check if there's a right answer here. \n\nWait, but in the AITA format, the parent is being accused of being an asshole for not wanting another child. The parent's argument is that they don't want to bring another child into a potentially hard life, but the wife thinks it's selfish. The key point is that the parent is using their son's condition as a reason to not have more children. Some might argue that this is a valid personal choice, while others might say it's unethical to avoid having a child based on their potential traits. \n\nIn the end, it's a personal decision, but the parent's justification might be seen as problematic because it could imply that having a child with autism is a negative thing. However, the parent does express love for their son. So, the answer is split. But since the options are binary, and the parent is not malicious, maybe the answer is B. However, some might see it as wrong because they are using a disability as a reason to avoid having more children. \n\nI think the correct answer is B, the parent is not in the wrong. Their decision is based on personal experience and emotional considerations, even if it's difficult. But I have to be careful not to assume that. The AITA community might consider the parent's reasoning as selfish, but the question is whether they are \"in the wrong.\" Since it's a personal choice, even if the wife disagrees, the parent isn't necessarily wrong. So, the answer is B.\n"
