Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not wanting another child because their son has autism and other challenges. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's son is autistic, has eczema, allergies, and sleep issues. They mention that the son's life is difficult, and they don't want to bring another child into a similar or worse situation. The wife thinks the author is being selfish, but he feels the opposite.\n\nNow, the key here is whether it's wrong to decide against having another child based on the child's potential to have similar challenges. Let's break down the arguments.\n\nOn the author's side, they're making a decision based on their current experiences. They love their son but are concerned about the quality of life for a future child. They mention seeing other autistic kids being bullied, which adds to their worry. They're prioritizing avoiding potential suffering for another child, which they don't see as selfish but protective.\n\nOn the other side, one could argue that autism is a part of neurodiversity and not a disability. The author's perception of autism as a burden might stem from their son's specific challenges (autism plus medical issues), not autism itself. Also, deciding against a child based on potential traits could be seen as limiting the child's autonomy or making assumptions about their future. The wife's view that the author is being selfish might come from feeling that he's not valuing the possibility of a happy life for another child.\n\nEthically, this is tricky. The author is making a personal choice based on their experiences. While they have valid concerns about their ability to provide adequate care and the potential hardships, others might argue that it's not their place to decide another person's life circumstances. However, it's also their right to make decisions about their family based on their values and capacity.\n\nConsidering that autism is a spectrum and each individual's experience is different, the author's son's challenges might be more due to the combination of autism with other conditions (eczema, allergies) rather than autism alone. The author might be conflating these factors, but their decision is based on their reality.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the author isn't harming anyone by deciding not to have another child. They're expressing concerns that stem from their current situation. While their wife disagrees, the decision doesn't directly harm others unless it involves coercion, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether prioritizing not bringing a child into a potentially difficult life is selfish. Different people have different views on this. Some might say it's responsible to consider the child's well-being, others might say it's limiting possibilities. Since the question is about being in the wrong, and there's no clear moral wrong in personal family planning decisions, the answer isn't straightforward. However, given that the author is making a personal choice and not acting maliciously, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But there's a counterargument that they're making assumptions about another child's life. Still, in the absence of coercion or harm, it's a personal choice. So I think the answer is B.\n"
