Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit-style post is in the wrong for not wanting another child because their son has autism. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's son was diagnosed with autism, which they weren't surprised about. They mention the child has a lot of challenges: sleep issues, eczema, allergies, and they're worried about bringing another child who might have similar or worse issues. The wife thinks the author is being selfish, but the author feels they're being responsible.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's reasoning. They love their son but don't want to have another child because they don't want another child to suffer similarly. They mention their own concerns about their child's quality of life and past experiences with autistic kids being bullied.\n\nNow, considering ethics and personal choice. People have different reasons for family planning. The author isn't making a decision based on the child's worth but on the challenges they face. However, others might argue that it's selfish to avoid parenthood based on a potential risk, especially since autism is a part of human diversity and doesn't inherently mean a \"hard life.\" Also, there's the issue of genetic factors\u2014autism isn't necessarily hereditary in every case, so the next child might not have it.\n\nBut the author is making a personal choice based on their capabilities and emotional readiness. They're considering their ability to care for another child with similar needs. It's their right to decide how many children they want to have. However, the wife feels hurt, so communication and mutual respect are factors here.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that not wanting to have another child isn't selfish if they're being honest about their capacity to handle it. Selfishness would be if they were ignoring their existing child's needs. Here, the author is prioritizing their ability to care, which isn't inherently wrong.\n\nSo, the answer could be B, not in the wrong. They're making a personal decision based on their circumstances. But there's a nuance here. The author's statement about not wanting another child because they \"don't want another person to have a life as hard\" could imply a belief that autism is a negative thing, which some might disagree with. However, the author's perspective is based on their own experiences and the specific challenges their son faces, which is a valid personal view.\n\nI think the key is whether it's \"wrong\" to make such a decision. Since the decision is about personal and family welfare, not harmful to others, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, it's important to note that their reasoning might be influenced by ableism, but that's a separate issue from whether they're in the wrong for the decision itself.\n"
