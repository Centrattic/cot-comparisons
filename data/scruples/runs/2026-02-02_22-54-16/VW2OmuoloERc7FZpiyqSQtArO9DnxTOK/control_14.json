Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let's break this down.\n\nThe author's son has been diagnosed with Autism, and they're considering not having a second child because they don't want another child to go through similar struggles. The key points here are their reasons: the child's current challenges like sleep issues, health problems, and the potential for another child to have similar or worse experiences. The author feels it's selfish to bring another child into such a difficult life, but their wife thinks they're being selfish and an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical perspectives. The author is making a personal decision based on their child's circumstances. They love their son but are concerned about the quality of life for a potential sibling. The question is whether it's wrong to prioritize avoiding potential suffering for another child. On one hand, choosing not to have another child because of the risks might be seen as a responsible decision, considering the existing challenges. On the other hand, some might argue that the decision is based on assumptions about the future child's life and that many people with Autism lead fulfilling lives with support.\n\nAlso, the author mentions their son's specific difficulties, which are real and impactful. Sleep deprivation and health issues add to the stress. The decision might be influenced by the current family's situation, not just the child's condition. However, making assumptions that another child would have the same issues could be problematic, as Autism is a spectrum and varies widely. The author might not account for the possibility that another child could have a different experience with support systems.\n\nAnother angle is the spouse's perspective. The wife feels the author is being selfish. That suggests a conflict in values between the couple. The author's stance is about preventing potential suffering, while the wife might prioritize the desire for another child regardless of risks. This is a personal family matter where both sides can have valid points.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, people often have strong opinions on AITA threads. Some might support the author's caution, while others might say that not having another child is selfish because it's a personal choice and not the author's place to decide another child's fate. There's also the consideration of eugenics or ableism if the author is devaluing the lives of Autistic individuals.\n\nBut the author isn't choosing not to have a second child because of the first child's disability per se, but because they don't want to risk another child having similar hardships. They are not making the first child's life worse; they're deciding their personal choice about procreating again based on their experiences. That might be within their rights, though it's a sensitive topic.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a nuanced situation. They are not malicious; they are making a tough decision based on their current circumstances and concerns. However, they might not be considering the variability of Autism and the support systems available. But in terms of being the \"asshole,\" the answer might depend on whether their reasoning is seen as valid. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I need to decide if their decision is inherently wrong.\n"
