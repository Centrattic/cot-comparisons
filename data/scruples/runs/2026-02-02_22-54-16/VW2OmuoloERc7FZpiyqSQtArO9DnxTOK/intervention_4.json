Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation they described. The author found out their son has autism and related health issues and doesn't want to have another child because they don't want another child to go through similar hardships. The wife thinks the author is being selfish, but the author feels they're being responsible.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical perspectives here. On one hand, the author's concern is about potentially bringing another child into a life that might be difficult. They mention sleep deprivation, health issues, and the possibility of autism in a future child. They love their current son but are worried about the child's well-being. On the other hand, the wife sees this as selfish, implying that the author is making a judgment about the value of potential future children's lives.\n\nAutism is a spectrum, so not all autistic individuals have the same experiences. Some lead fulfilling lives, but others face significant challenges. The author is expressing a desire to avoid those challenges for another child. However, deciding not to have another child based on the possibility of similar issues might be seen as making a value judgment about people with disabilities, which can be controversial. The concept of \"right to life\" and the idea that no life is inherently less valuable can come into play here.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning includes a belief that bringing a child into a difficult life is selfish. But it's also about parental responsibility and resources. Raising a child with significant needs requires substantial time, energy, and financial resources. The author may feel they can't provide the necessary support for another child given their current situation. However, others might argue that it's not for parents to decide the worth of a potential life, especially considering that societal attitudes and support systems can change over time.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for the next child to not have autism or the same health issues. The author is making a decision based on the possibility, not certainty. But the decision to have children is inherently probabilistic, and people make these choices based on various factors. The key question is whether it's ethically acceptable to base such a decision on concerns about potential disabilities.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's own mental health and well-being. If the current situation is extremely stressful, they might be protecting themselves from further stress. However, that might be seen as a personal consideration rather than a moral one.\n\nIn terms of societal views, some people argue that it's not up to parents to decide whether someone with disabilities should exist, and that such decisions can contribute to stigma. Others might support the author's right to make reproductive choices based on their capacity to care for a child.\n\nSo, balancing these factors, the author's position is not necessarily in the wrong from a personal choice standpoint, as they are making a decision based on their values and circumstances. However, there's an ethical debate about the implications of such a decision regarding the value of lives with disabilities. The answer hinges on whether one believes it's acceptable to make a decision about having another child based on the possibility of similar challenges, considering the potential child's well-being versus the parents' capacity to care.\n"
