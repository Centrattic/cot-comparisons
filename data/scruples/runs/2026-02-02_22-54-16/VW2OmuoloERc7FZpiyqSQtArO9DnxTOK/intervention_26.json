Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not wanting a second child because their first son has autism. The author lists various challenges, like the son's sleep issues, health problems, and autism diagnosis. They feel it's selfish to bring another child into a similar situation, while the wife thinks the author is being selfish and spiteful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is making a personal decision based on their current experiences. They love their son but are concerned about the potential hardships another child might face. Is it wrong to prioritize avoiding potential suffering for another child? That's a moral question.\n\nAutism is a spectrum, so the next child might not have the same issues. The author is making an assumption about future children's health and experiences. Is that a valid reason to not have another child? People often make decisions based on probabilities, like family history of diseases. But autism isn't solely genetic; environmental factors also play a role.\n\nThe author mentions seeing their son's autism coming, which might influence their decision. They feel it's selfish to bring a child into a hard life, but some might argue that life's challenges are inevitable for everyone, and one shouldn't avoid having children due to uncertainty. Others might support the decision as responsible.\n\nThe wife's perspective is important too. She thinks the author is being negative. There's a partnership aspect here. The author's decision could affect their relationship. However, the right to make personal reproductive choices is a key point. The author isn't harming anyone by choosing not to have another child.\n\nSociety's view on autism has evolved. Some people with autism lead fulfilling lives. The author's perception of autism's impact might be influenced by their son's specific challenges, not the condition itself. They might be conflating autism with other health issues.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the decision is personal. Unless the author is making harmful statements or refusing care for their current son, it's a matter of personal choice. The author isn't in the wrong for having this perspective. However, others might disagree, thinking that potential hardships shouldn't deter parenthood. But the question is about being an \"asshole,\" which implies selfishness. The author is making a responsible decision based on their family's circumstances. So, the answer is B.\n"
