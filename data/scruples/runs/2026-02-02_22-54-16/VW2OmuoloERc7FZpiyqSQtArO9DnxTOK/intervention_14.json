Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for deciding not to have a second child after their first son is diagnosed with autism. The author is male, and the situation is that they found out their young son has autism, which they weren't surprised by. The child has significant challenges: sleep issues, physical health problems like eczema and allergies, and the parents are getting very little sleep. The author feels that bringing another child into a similar situation would be unfair, especially given the potential for the child to face similar or worse hardships, including possible bullying. The wife thinks the author is being selfish, but the author sees it as making a responsible choice.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but they want my take. I need to decide A or B. \n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical aspects here. The author is making a personal decision based on their current experiences. They love their son, but they're weighing the potential suffering of a future child. The key points are the author's reasoning about not wanting another child with similar difficulties, the wife's reaction, and societal views on this.\n\nFrom a personal autonomy standpoint, individuals have the right to make reproductive choices based on their circumstances. However, autism is a neurodiverse condition, and some people argue that it's not a \"hardship\" but a different way of being. The author's perspective might be influenced by the specific challenges their son faces, which include both autism and other medical issues. The eczema and allergies complicate things beyond just autism, so maybe the author is conflating autism with other health problems.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption that the next child would necessarily have the same issues. Autism is on a spectrum, and each child is different. The author is making a probabilistic decision, but it's not certain that another child would have the same challenges. Also, the author mentions the risk of bullying based on past experiences, which might not reflect the current environment. Societal acceptance and support for autistic individuals have improved in some areas, though challenges remain.\n\nThe wife's perspective is that the author is being selfish. That could come from a place of wanting to have more children and possibly feeling rejected or that the author isn't supporting the family's original plan. The author's reasoning is that it's not selfish but responsible, which touches on the ethics of procreation. There's a philosophical debate here: is it ethical to bring a child into the world if there's a risk of suffering? Philosophers like David Benatar argue that procreation is inherently harmful because life involves suffering, while others believe the potential for happiness justifies it.\n\nThe author's situation is complex. They're under significant stress from caring for a child with multiple needs, and their decision is influenced by their current experiences. However, it's important to consider whether their fear is based on the specific combination of autism and other health issues or a broader stigma against autism. The line between protecting a future child from hardship and making assumptions about their quality of life is thin. The author might be projecting their son's specific struggles onto a hypothetical child, not accounting for individual differences.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, some people might view the author as in the wrong because they're making a decision that others with autism might see as limiting. Others might support the author's right to make a choice based on their circumstances. The key is whether the decision is based on genuine concern for the child's well-being or prejudice against autism. The author mentions their son's \"life as hard as my son's,\" which could be a valid concern given the specific challenges, but it's also possible that the author is overestimating the hardship due to their current stress and fatigue.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're making a personal decision based on their current experiences and stress, which is a valid consideration. However, the assumption that another child would have the same issues might be flawed. The author is not in the wrong for their feelings, but others might argue that autism isn't a negative and that the author is making a prejudiced decision. However, the presence of other medical issues complicates it beyond just autism. Ultimately, it's a personal choice, and while the author's reasoning is influenced by their specific situation, they are not objectively in the wrong for making that choice.\n"
