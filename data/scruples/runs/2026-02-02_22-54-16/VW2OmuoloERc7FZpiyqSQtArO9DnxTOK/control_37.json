Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting a second child after discovering their first son has autism. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the author's reasoning. They mention their son has autism, along with other challenges like sleep issues, eczema, and allergies. They feel bringing another child into the world with similar struggles would be selfish. They love their son but are hesitant to risk another child having a hard life. Their wife disagrees, calling them selfish.\n\nNow, considering ethics and personal choice. The author is making a decision based on their family's current circumstances. Autism is a spectrum, and while some face challenges, many lead fulfilling lives. The author's concern about potential suffering is valid, but does that make them wrong?\n\nFrom a rights perspective, parents have the right to make reproductive choices. However, others might argue that it's discriminatory to avoid having a child based on potential disabilities. But the author isn't choosing against a child due to existing conditions; they're concerned about future possibilities.\n\nThe key here is that the author isn't harming anyone yet. They're deciding not to have another child, which is a personal choice. While their wife sees it as selfish, the author's motivation is to prevent potential suffering. Society often debates this, but there's no absolute right or wrong. The author is acting on their values and experiences.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because the decision is based on their personal circumstances and values, and it's their right to choose not to have more children.\n"
