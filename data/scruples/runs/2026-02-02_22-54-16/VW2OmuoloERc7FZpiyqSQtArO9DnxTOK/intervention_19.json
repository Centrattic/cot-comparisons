Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for deciding not to have a second child due to their first son's autism diagnosis. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author's son has autism, which comes with significant challenges like sleep issues, allergies, eczema, and behavioral difficulties. The author feels that bringing another child into such a situation could mean another child with similar or worse problems. The wife thinks the author is being selfish, but he believes he's making a responsible decision.\n\nAutism itself isn't a disability that makes life \"bad\"; it's a neurodevelopmental condition with a wide range of experiences. People on the spectrum can lead fulfilling lives, though they may face societal challenges. The author's concern is about the potential hardships a future child might face, not autism itself. However, autism is a part of the child's identity, and many advocate against viewing it as a burden.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's reasoning is valid. Decisions about having children are deeply personal. The author is prioritizing the well-being of potential future children, considering the existing challenges. However, he might be making assumptions about what life with autism entails, possibly influenced by his own experiences and societal stigma.\n\nThe author's wife likely wants another child, so this decision affects their relationship. The author isn't considering the possibility that another child might not have autism or might have a different experience. Also, the author's view that it's selfish could stem from a place of wanting to protect a future child, but it's based on a negative perception of autism.\n\nIn terms of ethics, deciding not to have another child based on possible genetic factors isn't inherently wrong. Everyone has the right to make reproductive choices based on their circumstances. However, the way the author frames autism as a curse or a burden could be problematic. The narrative that autism is a tragic condition is harmful and overlooks the strengths and unique perspectives of autistic individuals.\n\nThe author's main point is about preventing potential suffering, which is a valid concern. But his reasoning might not account for the actual experiences of autistic people, some of whom may not see their condition as a disability. The decision to have children is personal, and the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to, but his perspective on autism could be contributing to the stigma.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the decision is based on selfishness or a genuine concern for the child's quality of life. Since the author is acting on his beliefs about potential suffering and making a personal choice, he's not necessarily the asshole. The answer would be B (No), but the reasoning is nuanced.\n"
