Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not wanting another child due to their son's autism diagnosis. The question is whether their decision is selfish or justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments presented. The author mentions their son has autism, along with other physical issues like eczema and allergies, and they're getting very little sleep. They love their son but feel it's unfair to bring another child into a situation where they might have similar or worse challenges. They also mention witnessing bullying of autistic peers in school, which adds to their concern about their child's future.\n\nThe wife thinks the author is being selfish. The author argues it's not selfish but about not wanting to take risks. The key points here are the author's reasoning based on their current experiences and their emotional response to potential future hardships for a second child.\n\nNow, considering ethical perspectives. Autonomy: the author has the right to make personal decisions about their family. They're not making a choice that directly harms others but are considering their own capacity and resources. However, others might argue that not having a child isn't inherently selfish, but the reasoning here involves a belief that another child might have a harder life, which could be seen as a form of eugenics or ableism, though the author isn't saying autism is bad, just acknowledging the challenges.\n\nSocietal views: There's a debate around disability and reproductive choices. Some might support the author's right to choose family planning based on their circumstances, while others might argue that people with disabilities deserve to be born if that's their reality, and it's not the parent's place to decide based on potential hardships.\n\nThe author's motivation is to protect future children from suffering, which is a common parental instinct. They're not making a choice based on the child's disability itself but on the quality of life and the challenges faced. The wife's perspective is that the author is being selfish, which is a value judgment. The question is whether the author's reasoning is valid or not.\n\nIn terms of moral philosophy, a utilitarian might look at the overall happiness. If the author believes another child's life would have more suffering, they might prioritize their own capacity to provide care. Deontological ethics might argue that it's wrong to make decisions based on potential traits of the child, but the author isn't selecting against the child's existence based on disability; they're considering their own resources and the child's potential quality of life.\n\nThe author's position is that they are making a difficult decision based on their current experiences and love for their son. They are not devaluing autism or the child but are realistic about their ability to care for another child with similar issues. The emotional toll and physical strain are significant factors here.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a complex issue. On one hand, the decision is personal and based on their unique circumstances. On the other, some might argue that it's a form of discrimination against people with disabilities. However, given the information, the author is not being malicious or cruel; they're making a choice based on their assessment of their capacity and the potential child's well-being. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
