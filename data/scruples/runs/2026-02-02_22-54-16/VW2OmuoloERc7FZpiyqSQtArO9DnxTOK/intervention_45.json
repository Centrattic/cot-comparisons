Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for not wanting a second child due to their son's autism. The author mentions their son has autism, along with other challenges like sleep issues, eczema, and allergies. They feel it's selfish to bring another child into such a hard life, even though they love their son deeply. Their wife disagrees, thinking they're being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is making a personal decision based on their current experiences. They're not denying the existence of their son's needs but are reflecting on the potential future for another child. The question is about whether this decision is morally wrong.\n\nAutism is a spectrum disorder; each individual's experience varies. The author's concerns are about potential suffering, not just autism itself. They mention physical and behavioral challenges that contribute to their stress. However, it's important to note that autism itself isn't a disability that inherently makes life \"bad\"\u2014many autistic individuals lead fulfilling lives with appropriate support. But the author is considering the possibility of additional challenges, which they've already experienced with their first child.\n\nThe wife's perspective is also important. She might feel that the author is underestimating their ability to support another child or is making a decision based on fear rather than love. The author's stance is about not wanting to \"roll the dice\" again, which is a valid personal choice, though others might view it as avoiding responsibility or underestimating their resilience.\n\nEthically, the debate often centers around autonomy versus potential harm. The author has the right to choose family planning based on their circumstances. However, some might argue that life's difficulties are part of being human, and that they're projecting their son's specific challenges onto a future child, who might have a different experience altogether. Another angle is that the decision could be influenced by societal stigma or misunderstanding about autism. For instance, the author mentions seeing classmates bullied, which might skew their perception of what life is like for autistic individuals.\n\nAlso, considering the child's autonomy isn't possible here since the decision is made beforehand. There's a philosophical debate about whether it's ethical to create a life with potential hardships, but that's complex. In this case, the author is making a choice based on their current capacity and emotional readiness.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're making a personal decision based on their experiences and the potential impact on the family. However, it's a nuanced issue. The answer isn't black and white. They're not denying their son's worth but are considering the future. Their feelings are valid, even if others disagree. The wife's perspective is also valid, leading to a conflict in viewpoints. The author isn't being malicious; they're expressing a genuine concern. So the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
