Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for deciding not to have a second child because their first child is autistic. The answer needs to be either A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their wife have a young son who was just diagnosed with autism. The son has significant challenges: he disrupts their sleep, has eczema, allergies, and the author is worried about the potential for a second child to have similar or worse issues. The author feels it's selfish to bring another child into such a difficult life, while the wife disagrees.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for having this perspective. The key points here are the author's reasoning and the ethical considerations around reproductive decisions. \n\nAutism is a spectrum disorder, and while it presents challenges, many autistic individuals lead fulfilling lives with appropriate support. The author's concern seems to stem from a desire to protect a future child from hardship. However, this raises ethical questions about the value placed on lives with disabilities. \n\nIn terms of ethics, there's the principle of not discriminating against people with disabilities. The author's decision implies that a life with autism might not be worth living, which is a controversial stance. On the other hand, people have the right to make personal choices about their family planning based on their circumstances and beliefs.\n\nThe author mentions that the wife thinks he's being selfish and an asshole. This suggests a conflict in values. The author's reasoning is based on the potential suffering of a future child, but it's possible that the wife sees the value in having another child despite the challenges. \n\nIt's also important to consider the author's perspective: he's exhausted from managing their current child's needs and fears that another child would exacerbate their situation. This is a valid concern, especially if the family's resources (time, money, emotional energy) are already stretched thin. However, deciding not to have another child based on the potential for disability can be seen as a form of ableism, which is a bias against people with disabilities.\n\nThere's also the aspect of probability. Autism is not hereditary in every case, and even if there's a genetic component, it doesn't guarantee that a future child would be autistic. The author is making a decision based on uncertainty, which could be seen as overcautious or reasonable.\n\nIn terms of societal views, there's a growing movement advocating for the rights and acceptance of autistic individuals. The idea that bringing a child into a difficult situation is selfish might be challenged by those who believe that with the right support, a child can thrive regardless of challenges.\n\nHowever, the author's decision is personal. While society might criticize the reasoning, the individual has the right to choose based on their values and circumstances. The question is whether this choice is \"wrong.\" \n\nConsidering all these factors, the answer hinges on whether prioritizing not having another child due to disability is considered ethical. If the author is making a choice that avoids potential suffering, some might argue it's reasonable. Others might argue it's wrong because it assumes that a life with autism is inherently less valuable. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, the decision to have children is complex and multifaceted. There's no universally right answer here. The author is making a personal choice based on their specific situation, which is a fundamental right. However, the way the author frames their decision as selfless when others might see it as discriminatory could be a point of contention. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's decision is understandable given their circumstances, the ethical stance on this issue is divided. The answer depends on whether the decision is seen as a valid personal choice or as discriminatory. Given the information, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because personal reproductive choices are generally considered individual rights, but there's a strong argument for A (in the wrong) from an anti-ableism perspective.\n"
