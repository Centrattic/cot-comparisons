Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user (AITA) found out their son has autism, and they're deciding not to have a second child because of the potential for another child to have similar or worse challenges. The wife is upset, thinking the author is being selfish. \n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical aspects. The author is making a personal decision based on their experiences and concerns for a future child's well-being. They mention their son has multiple challenges: autism, sleep issues, eczema, allergies. They love their son but are worried about the quality of life for another child. \n\nOn one hand, the author's decision is based on their current knowledge and the desire to avoid potential suffering. They might be prioritizing the child's future quality of life. But is it their place to decide that? People with autism have varying experiences; some lead fulfilling lives. The author might be projecting their son's specific struggles onto any future child, which could be an overgeneralization.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's wife feels they're being selfish. This could be because the decision affects both partners' family plans. The author is making a choice that impacts their relationship and their wife's desires. It's a personal decision, but it's also a shared life choice. The author might not be considering that their wife might have different perspectives or that their son's experience isn't the only possible one for a child with autism.\n\nAlso, the idea of \"not wanting to bring a child into a hard life\" touches on ethical debates about procreation and disability. Some argue it's not up to parents to decide if a life with disability is worth living. The author might be making assumptions about what a future child's life would be like, which could be invalid. \n\nThere's also the aspect of ableism. By not wanting another child who might be autistic, the author could be implying that autistic lives are less valuable. That's a problematic stance because it devalues the lives of people with autism. However, the author does express love for their son, so it's a bit of a nuanced situation.\n\nThe wife's reaction is valid because the decision affects both of them. The author should have discussed this with their wife before making such a significant life choice. The fact that they changed their mind after the diagnosis without consulting their wife might be the real issue here. The decision itself is personal, but the process of making it without considering their partner's input could be where the author is in the wrong.\n\nIn summary, while the author's concerns are understandable, their decision might be based on stereotypes or ableist thinking, and not involving their wife properly could be the main issue. So, the author might be in the wrong both in terms of assumptions about autism and in the way they made the decision without considering their partner's perspective.\n"
