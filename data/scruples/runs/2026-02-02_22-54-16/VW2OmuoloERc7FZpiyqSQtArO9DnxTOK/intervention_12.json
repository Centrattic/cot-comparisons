Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a parent whose son has been diagnosed with Autism. They mention that their son has multiple challenges\u2014Autism, sleep issues, eczema, allergies, and a history of sleep problems. The parent is deciding against having a second child because they don't want another child to face similar hardships. The wife is upset, thinking the author is being selfish, but the parent feels they're making a responsible choice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The parent's concern is about the well-being of a potential future child. They argue that it's not selfish to avoid bringing a child into a situation where they might have a hard life. On the other hand, others might say that not wanting to have a second child because of the first child's condition could be seen as discriminatory or stigmatizing towards people with Autism.\n\nAutism is a spectrum disorder, and many individuals live fulfilling lives. However, the author's son has significant co-morbidities, which complicate things. The parent's decision is based on their specific experience and the challenges they face. They might be worried about the ability to provide adequate care for another child given their current situation.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption that the next child would have Autism. While there is a genetic component, it's not guaranteed. The parent is making a decision based on the possibility, which is a personal choice. But is it wrong to factor in potential risks when making such a life decision?\n\nThe parent's love for their son is clear, but the decision to not have another child is based on fear of future challenges. Some might view this as a valid concern, while others might see it as avoiding responsibility or underestimating the potential for a second child's happiness.\n\nIn terms of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?), the community often looks at intent and impact. The parent's intent is to protect a potential future child from hardship, but the impact is straining their relationship with their spouse. However, the parent isn't making a decision that directly harms others except perhaps their spouse's wishes.\n\nConsidering all this, the decision is a personal one. The parent isn't in the wrong for choosing not to have another child based on their experiences and concerns. They're making a choice that prioritizes their family's well-being as they see it. However, it's a complex issue with no clear right or wrong answer. The key is that they're making an informed decision based on their circumstances.\n"
