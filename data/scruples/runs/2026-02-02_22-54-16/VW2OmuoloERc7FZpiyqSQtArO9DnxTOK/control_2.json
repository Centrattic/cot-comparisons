Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting a second child because their first child has autism.\n\nFirst, the author explains that their son has autism, which was confirmed by a specialist. They mention the challenges of having an autistic child, including sleep deprivation, health issues, and the emotional toll. The author feels it's selfish to bring another child into the world who might have similar or worse difficulties. The wife disagrees, calling the author selfish and spiteful. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nI need to consider ethical perspectives. On one hand, the author is making a personal choice based on their experience and the potential suffering of another child. They have valid concerns about the child's quality of life and the family's ability to cope. On the other hand, some might argue that it's discriminatory to avoid having another child based on a potential condition. Autism is a part of neurodiversity, and people with autism can lead fulfilling lives. The author's reasoning might be seen as ableist, assuming that a life with autism is inherently worse, which isn't a fair assumption for everyone.\n\nAlso, the author's wife's perspective is important. She might feel that the decision is based on fear or misunderstanding of autism. The author's stance could be influenced by the specific challenges they're facing, but it's possible that with proper support and resources, another child could thrive. The key here is whether the author's reasoning is based on a harmful stereotype or a realistic assessment of their family's situation.\n\nIn terms of ethics, autonomy is a factor. The author has the right to make decisions about their family. However, making a judgment about another person's potential quality of life based on a condition is complex. It's important to distinguish between making a personal choice and making a judgment that devalues others with autism.\n\nSo, considering these points, the answer isn't straightforward. But in the context of the question, the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. If the author is acting out of a desire to avoid potential suffering and is making a personal choice, they might not be in the wrong. However, if they're making assumptions that are harmful or discriminatory, they could be. The line between personal choice and discrimination is thin here. The community's response might vary, but from an ethical standpoint, it's a nuanced issue. However, given the options, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the author is making a personal decision based on their circumstances, even if others disagree.\n"
