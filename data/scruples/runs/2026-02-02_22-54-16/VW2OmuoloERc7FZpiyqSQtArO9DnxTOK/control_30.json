Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. The situation is that they found out their son has autism and now they don't want a second child because they don't want another child to go through the same struggles. The wife thinks they're being selfish and spiteful, but the author doesn't feel that way.\n\nFirst, let me break down the key points. The author's son has autism, with significant challenges: sleep issues, physical health problems like eczema and allergies. The author is worried about bringing another child into the world who might have similar or worse conditions. They feel it's selfish to do so, even though they love their son. The wife disagrees.\n\nI should consider the ethical angle here. Is it wrong to not want another child because of the possibility of similar challenges? On one hand, the author is making a decision based on their experience and the desire to prevent potential suffering. On the other hand, some might argue that every child has the right to be born, regardless of potential challenges, and that parents can provide a loving environment despite those challenges.\n\nAutism is a spectrum. The author is assuming that a future child would have the same level of difficulties, but autism varies a lot. Also, the author is projecting their experience onto a potential future child, which might not be accurate. However, the author is making a personal choice based on their current situation and stress.\n\nThe author's reasoning is rooted in wanting to prevent possible suffering. But is that a valid reason? Some people might say that parents should be open to life, and that challenges can be managed. Others might agree that it's a personal choice, and that the author is acting in good faith to avoid potential hardships.\n\nThe wife's reaction is that the author is being selfish and spiteful. That might be because she still wants another child, and the author's reasons are making her feel dismissed. There's a conflict in values here. The author is prioritizing avoiding potential suffering for a future child, while the wife might see it as avoiding the responsibility and joy of raising another child.\n\nI should also consider the aspect of autonomy. The author is making a decision about their family's future. It's their right to make that choice, but it's a joint decision with the spouse. The author's stance might be seen as selfish if it's based on fear or a desire to avoid difficulty rather than the child's best interest. But the author does express love for their current son, so maybe it's about preventing similar struggles.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption that having autism is inherently a hardship. While there are challenges, many people with autism lead fulfilling lives. The author's view might be influenced by the specific challenges their son has, which might not be the same for another child. Also, the author mentions the school experience with autistic kids being bullied, which is a real issue, but not all autistic individuals face severe bullying. It's a complex social issue.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the question is about whether it's morally wrong to not want a second child due to the possibility of similar conditions, it's a subjective matter. Some would argue that it's not wrong because it's a personal decision based on the family's circumstances. Others might say it's wrong because it's making a judgment about potential future lives and their worth.\n\nIn the AITA context, the community often looks at intentions and fairness. The author's intention is to avoid potential suffering, which they see as a form of selflessness. However, the wife feels slighted because the author is dismissing the possibility of another child based on fears. The author might be overgeneralizing their son's experience to a future child, which could be seen as not considering the unique circumstances a new child might have.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because it's a personal choice and the author is acting based on their current experiences and concerns. However, there's a counterargument that the author is being selfish by not wanting to take on the challenges, which is why the wife is upset. It's a nuanced situation, but the author's reasoning is based on a desire to prevent suffering, which is a common ethical consideration.\n"
