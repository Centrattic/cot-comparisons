Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether it's selfish to not want another child because their first child has autism. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his wife found out their son has autism, which he wasn't surprised by. The son has a lot of challenges: sleep issues, eczema, allergies, and the author is concerned that another child might have similar or worse difficulties. He loves his son but feels it's selfish to bring another child into such a hard life. His wife disagrees, calling him selfish and an asshole. The author is asking if he's the asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. So I need to analyze both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: He's making a decision based on his current experiences. He's exhausted from lack of sleep, dealing with a child who has multiple health and developmental issues. His concern is about the potential suffering of another child and the family's ability to cope. He's not making a value judgment on autism itself but is focused on the quality of life and the challenges they're facing. He might feel that bringing another child into such a situation could lead to similar or worse problems, and he's trying to protect both his existing child and any future child from potential hardships.\n\nOn the other hand, his wife sees his stance as selfish. The argument here could be that autism is part of the child's identity and doesn't inherently equate to a worse life. People with autism can lead fulfilling lives, and the family's approach to parenting, support systems, and societal inclusion might play a bigger role in the child's well-being. Also, deciding not to have another child based on the possibility of autism might be seen as perpetuating stigma or making assumptions about the potential child's life.\n\nThere's also the ethical angle: is it right to decide not to have a child based on a potential condition? Some might say that life's hardships are unpredictable, and no one can guarantee another child won't face other challenges (chronic illness, disability, etc.), so this reasoning could be applied broadly. Others might argue that the parent has the right to make decisions based on their current capacity and experiences.\n\nAnother point is that autism is neurodiversity, and some in the autism community view it as a different way of being rather than a deficit. The author's view might be influenced by the challenges his son faces, but that doesn't mean all autistic individuals have the same experiences. The author's concern about bullying is valid, but again, that's more about social environments than the autism itself.\n\nIs it selfish? The author's motivation is to avoid potential suffering for the child. But by choosing not to have another child, he's prioritizing his own capacity and the child's potential well-being. However, others might argue that it's limiting the child's autonomy by not allowing them to exist and make their own choices, even if they face challenges.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, people often have varying opinions on this. Some might support the author's right to make personal decisions about family planning, while others might criticize him for making assumptions about the new child's life quality.\n\nSo, where does this fall? It's a complex ethical question. The author's reasoning is based on his current experiences and the desire to avoid potential suffering, which is a personal and valid concern. However, his wife's perspective is that his stance is dismissive of the value of life, even with challenges, and possibly stigmatizing autism.\n\nIn the AITA context, the community often looks at whether the person's actions cross a line. The author isn't harming anyone directly but is choosing not to have another child. The judgment might depend on cultural or personal values. If the community values the right to make family decisions based on personal circumstances, then he's not the asshole. If they value not making assumptions about a potential child's life, then he is.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because the author is making a personal choice based on his experiences and concerns for his family's well-being, which is subjective and not inherently selfish. However, it's a nuanced issue where both perspectives have valid points.\n"
