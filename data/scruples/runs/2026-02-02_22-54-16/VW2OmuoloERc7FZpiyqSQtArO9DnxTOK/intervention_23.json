Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a parent whose son has been diagnosed with autism and has decided not to have a second child because they don't want another child to go through similar hardships. The wife thinks he's being selfish, but he feels it's the right choice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments. The author is making a personal decision based on their experience. They mention the challenges: lack of sleep, physical health issues, and the social difficulties (like bullying) they observed. They don't want to bring another child into a situation where they might face similar or worse struggles. The key here is that the author is choosing not to have another child, not that they're doing something harmful to their current child. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife thinks he's being selfish. But is it really selfish? The author is considering the potential future child's well-being. The concept of \"selfish\" here is subjective. The decision is based on their personal circumstances and what they believe is best for their family. It's important to note that the author loves their son and is not rejecting him; they're just reevaluating their plans based on new information.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, people have the right to make decisions about their family size and the potential challenges they're willing to face. While having children is a personal choice, it's not ethically wrong to decide against having more if the current situation is extremely challenging. The author isn't making a judgment about autism itself but about the quality of life for a potential future child, which is a sensitive topic but a personal one.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of autonomy. The author is acting on their own values and what they believe is right for their family. It's a difficult decision, but unless they're harming others or breaking any laws, it's within their rights. The wife's perspective might be different, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. People can have differing opinions here. \n\nSome might argue that autism is just a part of a person's identity and that the author is making a decision based on fear or misunderstanding. However, the author is acting on their real-life experiences with the challenges their son faces. It's a matter of how they perceive the quality of life for another child. The author isn't discriminating against their current son but is considering the potential for another child to have similar struggles.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is making a personal choice based on their circumstances and beliefs. Whether it's \"right\" or \"wrong\" is subjective, but unless the decision is harmful or discriminatory, it's not necessarily wrong. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
