Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for not wanting another child due to their son's autism. The author mentions the challenges they face with their son, including sleep deprivation, medical issues, and the autism diagnosis. They feel it's selfish to bring another child into a similar situation, while the wife disagrees.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author is in the wrong. First, the author's reasoning is based on concern for a future child's well-being, given their current son's struggles. They mention the potential for another child to have similar or worse difficulties. Some might argue that this is a personal choice and that the author is acting in the best interest of possible future children. Others might see it as selfish, as they are prioritizing their own comfort and existing child's needs over the possibility of another child's happiness.\n\nThe key points here are the author's motivation and the ethical implications. The author is making a decision based on love and desire to protect future children from hardship. However, others might argue that assuming a future child would have the same issues is speculative, and that parents should be prepared to support any child they have. The wife's perspective is also important; she thinks the author is being selfish, which adds complexity. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not necessarily whose side to take in the relationship conflict.\n\nIn ethical terms, this is a common debate about procreation and the duty to potential children. Some ethical frameworks suggest that it's not wrong to refrain from having children if one believes it would lead to significant suffering. However, others might argue that it's not the parent's responsibility to decide the quality of life for their children, who could still lead fulfilling lives despite challenges.\n\nThe author is also dealing with real stress and exhaustion, which could influence their decision. It's important to recognize that personal circumstances and emotional states play a role in such decisions. However, the decision to not have another child is a major life choice that should be made mutually in a relationship. The author's stance might be valid, but the conflict with the spouse complicates the situation.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision is based on their assessment of what's best given their current experiences. Whether it's right or wrong can be subjective. However, since the question is whether they are in the wrong, and considering personal autonomy and the intention to protect future children, the answer might lean towards them not being in the wrong. But there's a balance to strike here between self-preservation and the potential for another child's life to be valuable.\n"
