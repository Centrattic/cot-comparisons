Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The author is a parent whose son has been diagnosed with Autism. They mention the challenges their son has, like sleep issues, eczema, allergies, and the difficulty of managing his needs. The parent feels that bringing another child into the world might result in similar or worse challenges, so they don't want a second child. Their wife is upset with them for being selfish, but the parent feels they're being responsible.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects here. The parent is making a decision based on their current experiences. They love their son but are concerned about the potential hardships another child might face. On the other hand, their wife thinks they're being selfish. \n\nAutism is a spectrum, and while there are challenges, many Autistic individuals lead fulfilling lives. The parent's decision is based on their son's specific difficulties, which might be more than just Autism. The eczema, allergies, and sleep problems add to the complexity. However, each child is unique, and having one child with certain traits doesn't guarantee another will have the same. \n\nThe parent's reasoning is about not wanting to bring a child into a hard life, which is a form of ethical consideration. But is it right to base a decision on the possibility that another child might have similar issues? Some might argue that deciding against having another child due to genetic factors isn't inherently selfish. Others might say that it's impossible to predict the future and that not wanting to take a risk isn't wrong.\n\nHowever, another angle is that the parent is making a judgment about another potential person's life based on their current child's experience. Philosophically, this touches on the \"non-identity problem,\" where the parent's decision affects the existence of a future person but not their specific welfare. \n\nAlso, the parent mentions societal attitudes, like bullying, which are external factors and not within their control. They might feel they can't protect another child from that. But the parent's role is to provide support regardless, so maybe the decision is about their capacity to handle additional challenges.\n\nI should also consider the parent's mental health and the family's well-being. If they feel they can't give a second child the attention and care needed due to their current situation, that's a valid concern. But the wife's reaction might stem from a different perspective, valuing the desire for a family with multiple children regardless of potential challenges.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the parent isn't making a choice that harms the existing child but is making a personal decision about future children. The question is whether it's selfish to prioritize their comfort and avoid potential hardship over the possibility of another child. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether it's ethical to avoid having a child due to perceived risks. Some philosophical views would say it's up to the parents to decide, while others might argue that it's not their place to judge the worth of someone else's life. However, the parent's decision isn't necessarily denying someone a life; it's choosing not to have another child. \n\nGiven all that, the parent's reasoning is based on their circumstances and feelings, which can be valid. But the term \"asshole\" is subjective. The parent isn't being harmful to their current child or others, just making a personal choice. So maybe they aren't in the wrong, but their wife's perspective is also valid. The answer might be B (Not the Asshole) because the parent is making a decision based on their assessment of their family's well-being.\n"
