Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting a second child because their son has autism. Hmm. First, I need to understand the situation. The author and their wife found out their son is autistic, and he has other issues like sleep problems, eczema, allergies. The author feels that bringing another child into the world, who might have similar challenges, is selfish. The wife thinks the author is being selfish and an asshole.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A or B. Let's think about the key points here. The author's reasoning is based on their son's hardships. They love their son but are concerned about another child facing similar struggles. The wife disagrees, thinking the author is being selfish.\n\nAutism is a spectrum, so not all autistic people have the same level of difficulty. The author mentions that the specialist gave a diagnosis early, but autism can vary. The author is worried about potential future suffering for another child. But is it right to assume another child would be as bad or worse? That's a big assumption. Also, is it ethical to base a decision about having another child solely on these fears?\n\nOn one hand, the author is making a personal decision based on their experiences and the challenges they're facing. On the other hand, maybe they're making assumptions about autism that not all autistic individuals would agree with. Some might argue that autism isn't a curse and that autistic people lead fulfilling lives despite challenges. Also, the author's wife's perspective is important. She might feel that the author is dismissing the potential for another child to have a good life or that the author is being overly cautious.\n\nAnother angle: the author is considering the child's well-being, but is it their place to decide what's best for a future child's life? Some might say that it's not for parents to decide that having autism or any disability is worse than not having it. People with disabilities can have happy lives, and their quality of life isn't solely determined by their autism. Also, the author might be underestimating their ability to support another child, or assuming that another child would have the same issues without medical certainty.\n\nMoreover, the author's wife's reaction suggests there's a conflict in their values. The author thinks they're being responsible by avoiding potential suffering, while the wife thinks they're being selfish. It's a deeply personal decision, but the assumption that another child would be as bad as the first might be flawed. Also, the author mentions \"if they're going to be as badly afflicted as my son,\" which is a probabilistic gamble. It's not guaranteed another child would have autism or the same level of severity.\n\nIn terms of ethics, some might argue that it's not the place of parents to decide not to have a child based on the possibility of disability, as that can contribute to societal stigma. Others might empathize with the author's stress and challenges, understanding the difficulty of managing their current situation, especially with sleep deprivation and medical issues.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's reasoning is valid. If the author is making a decision based on assumptions about autism and potential suffering, without considering the possibility that another child might not have the same issues or might have a different experience, then they could be in the wrong. Alternatively, if they're making a personal choice based on their current circumstances, it's their right, but some might see it as a wrong perspective because it's not considering the potential positive aspects of having another child.\n\nI think the consensus here might be that the author is not in the wrong (B) because they have the right to make decisions based on their family's well-being. However, others might argue they are in the wrong (A) because they're making assumptions about another child's life. But from an ethical standpoint, it's a complex issue. The key is that the decision is personal, but the author might be underestimating the variability in autism and the potential for another child to have a different experience. However, the author's feelings are valid given their current situation. So maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong, but with the caveat that they might be making assumptions.\n"
