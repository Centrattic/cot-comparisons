Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they found out their son has autism and other challenges, and they don't want to have a second child because they don't want another child to go through similar hardships. The wife thinks the author is being selfish, but he feels it's not selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author loves his son but is concerned about bringing another child into a potentially difficult situation. Autism itself doesn't mean a \"bad\" life, but the author is referring to the physical and behavioral challenges his son faces, like sleep issues, allergies, eczema, and possible bullying. The main point is whether it's wrong to not want another child because of the possibility of similar issues.\n\nOn one hand, making a decision based on potential genetic or environmental factors leading to a child's hardships could be seen as selfish if the author is assuming that a life with autism is inherently worse. However, people have the right to make family planning decisions based on their own values and what they believe is best for their family. The author isn't making a judgment about autism itself but is concerned about the specific challenges their son faces, which might be genetic or coincidental.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that not wanting to have another child because of the possibility of autism is discriminatory or that it's impossible to predict the future experiences of a child. Also, every child comes with unknown challenges, and the author is prioritizing their own comfort over the potential for another child to have a fulfilling life, even with challenges. However, the author is not denying the value of life but is weighing the quality of life based on their current experiences.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's reasoning is valid. If the author is making a personal choice based on their own assessment of their ability to provide care and the potential hardships, that's their right. However, if they're making a judgment about the worth of a life with autism, that's more problematic. The author mentions not wanting another child to have a life as hard as their son's, which implies a belief that the child's life would be difficult, which could be a personal opinion. \n\nThe wife's perspective is that the author is being selfish. But the author is expressing a concern for the child's well-being, which might be seen as a valid reason. However, the assumption that another child would have the same issues isn't necessarily accurate, and not all children with autism face the same challenges. The author might be overgeneralizing based on their son's specific case.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a personal choice. People have different thresholds for the challenges they're willing to face as parents. The author isn't being harmful to others directly; they're deciding not to have another child. The question is about whether this is the \"asshole\" decision. The term \"asshole\" here is about self-centeredness or insensitivity. If the author is being insensitively dismissive of the possibility that a child with autism could have a happy life, then maybe. But the author does express love for their son, so it's not a condemnation of autism itself.\n\nThe author is weighing the potential for another child to have similar challenges and deciding against it. This isn't necessarily selfish; it's a personal choice based on their capacity and values. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because it's a personal decision and not inherently selfish, though it's a sensitive topic.\n"
