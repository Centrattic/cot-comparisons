Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for deciding not to have a second child because their first child is autistic. The author is getting flak from their wife for being selfish and spiteful, and they want to know if they are the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author's son has autism and other health issues like eczema and allergies, leading to a lot of stress and lack of sleep. The author is worried that a second child might have similar or worse challenges and doesn't want to subject another child to that. The wife, on the other hand, thinks the author is being selfish.\n\nAutism is a spectrum disorder, and while it comes with challenges, it's also a part of the person's neurodiversity. The decision to have children is personal and can be influenced by many factors, including the perceived ability to provide care and the desire to avoid potential suffering.\n\nThe key point here is whether the author is being selfish for not wanting another child. The author isn't denying care to their current child but is making a choice based on their experience and the potential future for another child. People have different values and priorities when it comes to family planning. Some might argue that it's selfish to not try, while others might see it as responsible given their circumstances.\n\nIt's important to note that autism itself isn't a \"bad\" condition; it's a different way of experiencing the world. The author's concern about bullying and challenges is valid, but so is the fact that many autistic individuals lead fulfilling lives with support. The author's decision is based on their current experience and fears, which can be a legitimate basis for their choice.\n\nThe wife's reaction might stem from feeling that the author is dismissing the possibility of future support or the potential for a different experience with another child. However, the author's feelings are also valid as they are reacting to their current reality.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's no absolute right or wrong here. The decision is a personal one, and unless the author is harming their child or others, it's a matter of personal choice. The author isn't being in the wrong for making a decision that aligns with their values and life circumstances. They are not the asshole for choosing not to have another child based on their experiences.\n"
