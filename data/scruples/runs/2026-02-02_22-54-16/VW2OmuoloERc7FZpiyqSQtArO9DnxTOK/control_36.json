Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's take a look at this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting a second child because their first child has autism. The author explains that their son has autism, which they found out recently, and he has various challenges like sleep issues, eczema, and allergies. They feel that bringing another child into the world, especially one who might have similar or worse issues, is selfish. Their wife disagrees, saying they're being selfish and an asshole. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is making a personal decision based on their experience with their current child. They argue that they don't want another child to suffer similarly. But is it ethical to make a decision about having another child based on the possibility that they might have autism? Autism is a spectrum, and while there are challenges, many people with autism live fulfilling lives. The author's perspective seems to be influenced by their current struggles, which are significant.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the decision to have children is deeply personal. The author is not making a choice about their current child but about future possibilities. They are considering the potential quality of life for a future child. But does that make them selfish? Some might argue that it's reasonable to consider the well-being of future children, while others might see it as discriminatory or ableist, assuming that a child with autism would have a worse life.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that their wife thinks they're being selfish. This suggests a conflict in their relationship. The wife might value having a larger family, while the author is prioritizing the potential well-being of a future child. The author's reasoning is based on their current experience, which is valid, but it's also based on assumptions about the future child's life. They might be projecting their current difficulties onto a future child, not accounting for possible improvements in support, treatment, or the child's own perspective on their condition.\n\nAnother angle is the idea of \"playing the odds.\" Autism is not guaranteed in another child, even if one child is autistic. The author is choosing not to take the risk, which could be seen as a responsible decision based on their current capacity to manage their son's needs. However, others might argue that it's not fair to pre-judge a potential child's life based on assumptions.\n\nI should also consider the broader implications. Decisions about having children based on potential disabilities can touch on eugenics and ableism, which are sensitive topics. It's important to recognize that people with autism and other conditions contribute meaningfully to society and have valid lives. The author's fear might stem from a lack of understanding or support, but it's not necessarily malicious. However, the decision to avoid having another child based on the possibility of autism could be seen as devaluing the lives of those with autism.\n\nIn summary, the author's reasoning is complex. They are prioritizing their current family's well-being and their son's challenges, which is understandable. However, their reasoning could be viewed as problematic if it implies that a child with autism would have an inherently worse life. The key is whether their decision is based on a desire to prevent potential suffering or a devaluation of autistic lives. If they truly believe that an autistic child could have a good life but are choosing not to take the risk due to personal circumstances, that's different from holding a negative view of autistic people. However, the way they frame it\u2014saying it's selfish to bring a child into a hard life\u2014might indicate underlying ableism, even if unintended.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a nuanced case. On one hand, they're making a personal choice based on their experiences. On the other hand, their reasoning might inadvertently devalue autistic individuals. The answer might hinge on whether their decision is based on fear of challenges or a belief that autistic lives are not worth living. The latter would make them in the wrong, but if it's about their ability to cope, it's more about personal choice. Given the author's statement that they love their son and the potential future child but don't want them to suffer, it's more about their capacity to provide adequate care rather than a judgment on autistic people's worth. However, the perception from others (like their wife) might see it as selfish, so the answer could be A (they are in the wrong) if the reasoning is considered ableist, or B (not in the wrong) as a personal choice. The line is thin here.\n"
