Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting a second child because their first son has autism. The author mentions that their son has autism, along with other challenges like sleep issues, eczema, allergies. They feel it's selfish to bring another child into the world with similar struggles. The wife thinks the author is selfish and spiteful, but the author feels the opposite.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author is making a personal decision based on their experiences and the challenges they face with their first child. The key points are their reasoning: wanting to avoid another child potentially having a hard life, their intuition about the son's autism, and the current stress on the family.\n\nAutism is a spectrum, and while it can come with challenges, many people with autism lead fulfilling lives. The author's concern is about the child's well-being and potential suffering, but is it their place to decide that for a future child? Also, the author is projecting based on their current child's specific difficulties, which might not apply to another child. Each child is unique, even within the same family.\n\nThe author's decision is a personal one, and while it's controversial, it's not necessarily wrong. However, it's important to consider the ethical stance on procreation and the rights of the future child. Some might argue that the author is making a judgment about the quality of life that another person (the future child) might not agree with. Others might see it as a responsible decision based on their current circumstances.\n\nThe wife's reaction is also a factor. The author's decision could be seen as selfish if it's based on not wanting the stress, but the author's reasoning is more about the child's potential suffering. The line between self-interest and concern for the child's well-being is thin here. \n\nIn terms of morality, there's no clear right or wrong. The author's choice is valid as a personal belief, but others might view it as being in the wrong for not wanting to take on the challenges, especially if they can provide support. However, the author isn't harming anyone by not having another child. The decision is about their own family's future and their ethical considerations. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer would be that the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Their decision is based on their perception of their first child's struggles and a desire to avoid similar hardships for another child. However, it's a complex issue with valid arguments on both sides. The key is that the author is making a personal choice, which, while controversial, isn't inherently wrong.\n"
