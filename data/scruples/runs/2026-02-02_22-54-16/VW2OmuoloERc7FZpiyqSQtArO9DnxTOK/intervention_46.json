Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting another child because their son is autistic. The question is whether that decision makes them an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasoning. They mention their son's autism diagnosis, along with other challenges like sleep issues, eczema, allergies. They feel bringing another child, who might have similar issues, would be too much and potentially harmful. They also reference seeing kids with autism being bullied in school.\n\nThe author's wife thinks they're selfish and spiteful, but the author feels the opposite. The key here is whether not wanting another child due to the potential for similar hardships is a selfish act or a responsible decision.\n\nI should think about autonomy in family planning. Parents have the right to decide how many children they want, especially considering their current circumstances. However, the way the author expresses their concerns might come across as dismissive of the value of life or the possibilities of a different experience for another child.\n\nAutism is a spectrum. Just because one child is autistic doesn't mean another will have the same level of challenges. The author might be generalizing based on their son's experience, which could be a valid concern but also a potential oversight.\n\nThe author's motivation is rooted in love and concern for their existing son's well-being, which is understandable. But the phrasing of \"not wanting to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's\" could imply a belief that autism is inherently a negative condition, which some might find problematic. However, others might see it as a genuine concern for their child's quality of life.\n\nThe question of being an asshole hinges on intentions and the impact of the decision. The author isn't making a decision that harms others directly; they're making a personal choice about family size. While their wife disagrees, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having a different perspective, especially given their personal experiences.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of societal attitudes towards disability. The author's fear that another child might be bullied is a real concern, but it's a societal issue rather than a personal one. The decision to not have another child isn't wrong in itself, but the reasoning might reflect some underlying biases that others might criticize.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for making a personal choice based on their experiences and values. However, the way they express their concerns might need more sensitivity, especially considering that autism is part of the human diversity and not inherently a curse. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that their reasoning could be seen as controversial or lacking in understanding from another perspective.\n"
