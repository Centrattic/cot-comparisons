Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting another child because their first son has autism. The author explains that their son has autism, severe eczema, allergies, and sleep issues. They feel bringing another child into a similar situation would be selfish. The wife disagrees, calling the author selfish and an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects. The author is making a personal decision based on their experience. They love their son but are concerned about the potential hardships another child might face. The key here is autonomy in family planning. The author isn't making a decision based on the child's condition being a burden per se, but rather their own assessment of the potential for similar hardships.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The author mentions that autism might be genetically linked, but they are not certain. The specialist confirmed autism in the son, but the author is speculating that another child could be similarly affected. That's a gamble based on family history but not a certainty. The author is choosing to not take that risk, which is a personal choice.\n\nNow, considering the societal perspective, some might argue that it's selfish to avoid having another child because of the possibility of the child having challenges. Others might support the decision, respecting the parents' right to make choices based on their circumstances. The author isn't denying their son needs care; they're just not wanting to repeat the experience. \n\nThe wife's reaction is also a factor. She feels the author is being spiteful, which could indicate a lack of communication or differing values. But the author's decision isn't about rejecting the child but about future planning. \n\nIn terms of legal or moral wrongdoing, there's no law against not wanting another child. Morally, it's a personal choice. The author is not harming anyone by choosing not to have another child. The ethical dilemma here is whether it's right to have children with potential hardships, but the decision is between the parents. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the decision is considered selfish. The author's reasoning is based on avoiding potential suffering, which some might see as a responsible choice, while others might see it as avoiding responsibility. However, in the absence of coercion or harm, it's a personal choice. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
