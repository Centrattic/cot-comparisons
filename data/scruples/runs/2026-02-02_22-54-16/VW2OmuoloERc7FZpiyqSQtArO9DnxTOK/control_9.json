Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting another child because their first son has autism. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author found out their son has autism, which was a surprise to the wife but not to him. The son has multiple challenges: sleep issues, eczema, allergies, and the author is concerned about bringing another child who might have similar or worse issues. The wife thinks the author is being selfish, but he feels it's the right decision.\n\nI need to consider ethical viewpoints here. On one hand, the author is making a decision based on their current experiences and wanting to avoid potential suffering for another child. On the other hand, autism is a neurodiverse condition, not a disease, and many autistic people lead fulfilling lives. The author's perspective might be influenced by the specific challenges they're facing with their son, but that doesn't necessarily make it right or wrong.\n\nThe key points are: the author's concern for the child's well-being, the wife's perspective, societal views on autism, and the ethics of reproductive decisions. The author is not wanting to \"roll the dice\" again, which is a personal choice. However, some might argue that it's presumptuous to decide another child's quality of life. Others might agree that the author is prioritizing the child's potential well-being.\n\nI should also consider that autism is part of who the child is, and the author's experience is colored by the challenges they face. The author's intention is to prevent suffering, but that could be seen as a form of ableism if it's based on the assumption that autism is inherently a burden.\n\nIn the end, whether it's right or wrong is subjective. The decision is deeply personal, and without more context, it's hard to say. However, many would argue that the author isn't in the wrong because they're acting based on their current knowledge and values, even if others disagree. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
