Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting a second child after their son is diagnosed with autism. The author mentions their son has autism and various physical issues, leading to a lot of stress and sleep deprivation. They feel it's selfish to bring another child into a similar situation, while the wife disagrees.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is making a personal choice based on their experiences and concerns. They are worried about the potential hardships another child might face, especially with the risk of autism and other conditions. On the other hand, the wife sees this as selfish. \n\nAutism is a spectrum disorder, and while some individuals face significant challenges, others live fulfilling lives. The author's perspective seems to be influenced by their current struggles, which are valid. However, deciding not to have another child based on a genetic condition might involve assumptions about the likelihood and severity of the condition in a future child. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning includes the desire to avoid potential bullying, which the user might have observed in their own experiences. But that could also be a fear rather than a certainty. The key here is whether it's ethical to make such a decision. \n\nSome might argue that it's understandable to prioritize the well-being of existing children and the family's capacity to handle more challenges. Others might see it as discriminatory or stigmatizing against autistic individuals. The author does express love for their son, so it's not a rejection of him but a concern for future children's well-being. \n\nI should check if there's any medical or statistical angle. Autism can have genetic factors, but it's not guaranteed. The author's son has autism, but the next child might not. However, the author is using the current child's experience as a reason not to take the chance. \n\nSocietal perspectives vary. Some people might view this as a legitimate precaution, while others might think the author is overestimating the risks or underestimating the family's ability to adapt. The wife's reaction is also a factor; she might feel the decision is unfair or based on fear. \n\nUltimately, it's a personal choice. The author isn't causing harm by not having another child. They are making a decision based on their values and the family's circumstances. Whether it's right or wrong is subjective, but from an ethical standpoint, they are within their rights to make that choice. The answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
