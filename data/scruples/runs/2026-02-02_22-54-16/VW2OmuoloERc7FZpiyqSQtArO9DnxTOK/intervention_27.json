Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for deciding not to have a second child after their first son was diagnosed with autism. The person argues that bringing another child into a similar situation would be selfish, given the challenges their son faces. The wife is upset, thinking he's being selfish and spiteful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects here. The author's decision is based on concern for the potential well-being of a future child. They're using their experience with their son's struggles as a basis for not wanting another child who might face similar or worse challenges. On the other hand, the wife feels hurt, which suggests that the author's reasoning might be causing relational strain.\n\nAutism is a spectrum, and while some individuals face significant challenges, others lead fulfilling lives. The author might be overgeneralizing, assuming that a second child would have an equally difficult life. However, it's also valid for someone to make a choice based on their current experiences and the potential risks they're aware of. \n\nThe question is whether it's selfish to avoid potentially subjecting another child to hardship. The author's intention is to protect the child, which could be seen as a moral stance. However, others might argue that it's not their place to decide the worth of another person's life, especially since autism is just one aspect of a person's identity and doesn't define their overall quality of life. \n\nAdditionally, the author's wife's reaction is important. Decisions about family planning are typically mutual, and the author's unilateral change in stance without considering their shared desire for a second child might contribute to the conflict. The author's perspective might not account for the fact that having another child could provide support for the first one, which can be beneficial in some cases.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author's concern for the child's well-being, potential overgeneralization of autism's impact, the impact on the relationship, and the ethical debate around choosing not to have children based on potential disabilities. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intentions and the impact on others. The author's intention is to avoid hardship, but the impact on the wife and possibly their son (if they don't consider his perspective) might be significant. The community might split between those who think it's a personal choice and those who see it as dismissive of the value of all lives. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because the decision is based on personal values and concerns for the child's potential well-being, even if others might disagree. However, the situation is nuanced, and the author's approach could be improved by more open communication with their wife.\n"
