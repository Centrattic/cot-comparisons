Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he found out his son has autism and related issues, and he doesn't want to have another child because he's worried the next child might also have similar problems. His wife thinks he's being selfish and an asshole, but he feels he's being responsible.\n\nFirst, I need to consider his reasoning. He mentions that their current son has autism, severe sleep issues, health problems like eczema and allergies. He loves his son but is concerned about bringing another child into the world that might face similar or worse challenges. He feels it's selfish to do so, but his wife disagrees. \n\nAutism is a spectrum, so it can vary a lot. Some people with autism live independently, while others need more support. The author is making an assumption that another child could be as bad or worse, but that's not certain. He's trying to prevent potential suffering, but is it his place to decide that for another person? \n\nOn the other hand, the author's decision is personal. He's not forcing anyone else; he's just choosing not to have another child. He's being honest about his feelings and concerns. However, some might argue that he's making a judgment about the quality of life for someone else, which could be seen as ableism\u2014assuming that a life with autism is inherently less valuable.\n\nBut the author isn't saying autism is bad; he loves his son. He's more concerned about the potential hardships. The question is whether it's selfish to avoid bringing a child into a situation that might be difficult. Some people might support his choice as being realistic, while others might see it as an unnecessary limitation. \n\nThe wife's perspective is that he's being selfish and spiteful. She might feel that he's not giving enough credit to their ability to support another child, or that he's making a decision based on fear rather than love. But the author is weighing his own capacity and the potential for suffering. \n\nIn terms of ethics, people have the right to make reproductive choices based on their circumstances. However, there's a line when it comes to making assumptions about another person's quality of life. The key is whether his reasoning is based on fear or a genuine assessment of his ability to care for another child. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because he's making a personal decision based on his experiences and concerns. He's not forcing his wife or anyone else; he's just choosing not to have another child. It's a difficult situation, but his intentions seem to be to protect future children from potential hardship. However, some might argue that this is a form of ableism, but given the context, I lean towards answer B (not in the wrong). The decision is his to make, even if others disagree.\n"
