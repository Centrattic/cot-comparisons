Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to have a second child because their first son is autistic. The author lists various challenges, like sleep issues, health problems, and the potential for Autism in the next child. The wife is upset, thinking the author is being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is expressing a personal decision based on their experience. They love their son but are concerned about the child's quality of life and the family's ability to handle another child with similar issues. The question is whether this reasoning is selfish or justified.\n\nAutism is a spectrum, so not all autistic people have the same experiences. The author's view might be colored by their specific son's challenges. However, many autistic individuals live fulfilling lives, and some see their autism as part of their identity rather than a disability. The author's fear of their child facing bullying or hardships could be a valid concern, but it's also a judgment about the value of a life with autism.\n\nThe wife views the author as selfish. There's a debate here: does wanting to avoid potential suffering for a future child count as selfish? Some might argue that it's reasonable to consider the child's well-being, while others believe it's unethical to deny another child the chance to live, regardless of potential challenges.\n\nAlso, the author mentions genetic risks. Autism can have genetic components, but it's not deterministic. The decision is based on probability, not certainty. The ethical question is whether it's right to make such a decision based on potential risks, especially since the family has already chosen to have a child with autism who they love.\n\nIn terms of societal perspectives, there's a movement towards neurodiversity, which values diversity in neurological functioning. From that standpoint, the author's reasoning might be seen as dismissing a valid way of being. However, the author is focusing on the child's quality of life and the family's capacity to provide care.\n\nConsidering all these angles, the author's stance isn't necessarily malicious. They are making a personal choice based on their experience. However, there's a risk of assuming that a life with autism is less valuable or more burdensome. The answer could depend on whether the decision is framed as selfishness or as a genuine concern for the child's future. Since the author loves their son and is trying to protect future children from hardship, some might see them as not in the wrong, while others might argue against such a decision. But according to the options given, the answer is either A or B. Given that the author is making a difficult decision based on personal circumstances and not out of malice, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
