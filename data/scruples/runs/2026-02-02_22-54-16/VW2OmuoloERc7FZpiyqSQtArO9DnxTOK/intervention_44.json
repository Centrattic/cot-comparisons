Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting a second child because their son has autism. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasoning. They mention their son's significant challenges: autism diagnosis, sleep issues, health problems like eczema and allergies. The author feels it's selfish to bring another child into a similar situation, considering potential bullying and a hard life. They love their son but are hesitant to have another child due to these factors.\n\nNow, the question is whether this decision makes them an asshole. The author's stance is that they're not rolling the dice again, avoiding potential suffering for another child. Their wife disagrees, seeing the decision as selfish. \n\nI should think about autonomy in family planning. People have the right to decide their family size based on their circumstances. The author is prioritizing the well-being of future children, which is a valid concern. However, autism itself isn't a \"bad\" condition; it's a part of neurodiversity. The author's view might stem from their son's specific challenges rather than autism itself. \n\nBut is it wrong to not want another child because of this? It's a personal choice. However, the author's reasoning could be seen as making assumptions about another child's life quality. Maybe they're projecting their son's experiences onto a potential future child. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is aware of the possible hardships and wants to prevent suffering. This could be seen as a responsible decision. The key point is whether the decision is selfish. The author isn't harming anyone; they're choosing not to have another child. Their wife's reaction is valid, but it's a difference in perspective. \n\nI need to check if the author is making a judgment that autism is negative. If they're basing the decision solely on the challenges their son faces, it's understandable. But if they're generalizing all autistic children to have the same issues, that might be problematic. However, the author specifically mentions their son's conditions, not autism alone. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether not wanting another child because of potential similar hardships is selfish. Since parents have the right to make such decisions based on their family's situation, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're acting in what they believe is the best interest, even if others disagree. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
