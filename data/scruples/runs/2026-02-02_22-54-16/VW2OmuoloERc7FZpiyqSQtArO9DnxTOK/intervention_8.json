Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for deciding not to have a second child after their first child was diagnosed with autism. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The father and wife have a young son with autism, confirmed by a specialist. The son has various health issues and challenging behaviors. The father feels that bringing another child into the world, who might have similar difficulties, is selfish. The wife disagrees, calling him selfish and an asshole. The father is seeking validation.\n\nSo, the question is whether the father is in the wrong for his decision. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nLet me consider the possible angles. On one hand, the father's concern is about the well-being of a potential future child. If there's a genetic or other risk that the next child could have similar challenges, he's making a choice to avoid that. He's also considering the family's ability to cope with multiple children with complex needs. His motivation seems to be protective, wanting to prevent another child from enduring a hard life.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that making assumptions about the future child's life is speculative. Autism is a spectrum, and while some individuals face significant challenges, others have high support and lead fulfilling lives. The father's decision is based on his son's specific issues, but each child is unique. Also, the wife's perspective is important here; she might feel that the decision is unfair or that they should face challenges together regardless.\n\nAnother point is that the father acknowledges loving his son deeply. His decision isn't driven by dislike but by a desire to avoid hardship. However, others might see this as a form of ableism, implying that lives with autism are not worth living. That's a sensitive area because autism is part of the neurodiversity movement, which emphasizes acceptance and support rather than viewing it as a disability to be avoided.\n\nThere's also the aspect of personal choice in family planning. Parents have the right to decide how many children to have based on their circumstances. If the father believes that having another child with similar needs would overwhelm the family, that's a valid concern. However, others might argue that they should embrace the challenges and provide support, rather than opting out.\n\nI should check if there's any indication that the father is using his son's autism as an excuse to avoid responsibility or if he's being genuinely protective. The post mentions the son's sleep issues, health problems, and the father's intuition. It doesn't seem like he's dismissing autism but is concerned about the quality of life for another child.\n\nIn terms of societal views, there's a balance between respecting the parent's decision and challenging potential biases. The father's fear of the child being bullied is a real issue, but it's also a societal problem that needs addressing rather than avoiding childbearing. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the father's decision is a personal one. He's making a choice based on his family's current situation and his perception of future risks. While some may disagree, it's his right to decide. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
