Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for deciding not to have a second child because their first son is autistic. The answer needs to be A or B, with A being yes (wrong) and B no (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's son has autism, which was confirmed by a specialist. The son has significant challenges, including sleep issues, health problems, and the author is concerned about the possibility of another child having similar or worse issues. The wife wants another child, but the author is against it, thinking it's selfish.\n\nNow, considering different viewpoints. The author's decision is based on love and wanting to avoid more suffering. They mention the child's difficulties and the impact on their family's well-being. However, the wife thinks the author is being selfish. The key here is whether not wanting to have another child, based on the existing child's conditions, is selfish or a reasonable decision.\n\nAutism is a spectrum, and while some individuals face significant challenges, others lead fulfilling lives. The author's concern is valid, but they might be making assumptions about a future child's life quality. Also, the decision to have children is deeply personal. The author is prioritizing the potential child's well-being, which could be seen as ethical. However, others might argue that not wanting to take the risk could be seen as limiting the child's potential or avoiding responsibility.\n\nSocietally, there's a view that disability isn't a reason to avoid having children, emphasizing that people with disabilities can have good lives. The author's perspective might be influenced by the challenges they've faced with their son, but it's not necessarily wrong to prioritize family dynamics and resources. The wife's frustration could stem from differing values\u2014perhaps she believes in giving the opportunity to have another child despite the risks.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is making a personal choice based on their circumstances. There's no right or wrong answer here, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the decision is personal and based on their current knowledge and experiences, it's not inherently wrong. However, if they are making assumptions that a future child would have the same hardships without considering possible positive outcomes, that could be a point of criticism. But given the context, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because it's a personal decision based on their family's well-being.\n"
