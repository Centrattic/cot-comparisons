Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting another child after their first son has autism.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The father found out his young son has autism and other health issues. He's decided against having a second child because he doesn't want another child to go through similar hardships. His wife disagrees, thinking he's being selfish. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main factors here are the father's reasoning and the moral implications. The father loves his son but is concerned about the potential for another child to have similar challenges. He mentions the sleep deprivation, medical issues, and the social difficulties (like bullying) he observed in others with autism. He sees it as selfish to bring another child into such a situation, while his wife sees it as selfish that he's not wanting another child.\n\nNow, considering ethics and personal choice. The father is making a decision based on his own experiences and the well-being of any future child. He's not saying autism is bad, but he's considering the potential hardships. However, this could be seen as making assumptions about a potential child's quality of life, which might be controversial. On the other hand, people have the right to make reproductive choices based on their circumstances.\n\nAnother angle: autism is a spectrum. Some people with autism live fulfilling lives. The father's decision might be based on his son's specific challenges, but not all autistic individuals have the same experiences. His concern is valid given their current situation, but it's a personal choice.\n\nAlso, societal views on disability and family decisions. Some might argue it's not up to parents to decide if a child's life is worth living, while others respect the parents' right to make that choice for their family. The father isn't choosing between children but is making a personal decision based on his capacity to care and his ethical stance.\n\nThe wife's perspective is important. She might feel he's giving up on the idea of more children because of fear or not enough information. But the father is expressing a genuine concern rooted in his experiences.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a complex issue. The decision is personal, and there's no right or wrong answer, but rather a matter of perspective. Some might say he's in the right to prioritize his family's well-being, while others might see it as prejudice against people with disabilities. However, since it's a personal choice and he's not harming anyone by not having another child, it's more about his right to make that decision.\n"
