Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they found out their son has autism and they don't want to have a second child because they think the next child might have similar or worse challenges. The author is asking if they're the asshole for not wanting another child because of this.\n\nFirst, I should consider the author's perspective. They love their son but are overwhelmed by the challenges\u2014sleep deprivation, eczema, allergies, and the autistic traits. They feel it's selfish to bring another child into such a difficult life, especially since they've seen how kids with autism are treated in school, being bullied. They changed their mind about having a second child because of these concerns.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife thinks the author is being selfish and spiteful. So there's a conflict in their views. The author's reasoning is that they don't want another child to suffer, but the wife disagrees. \n\nAutism is a spectrum, and while it can present challenges, many people with autism lead fulfilling lives. The author is making an assumption that another child would have the same or worse issues. But autism is complex and varies widely. Also, the author's experience with their son's specific challenges (sleep issues, allergies) might be more about the individual child rather than autism itself. \n\nIs it ethical to decide not to have another child based on the possibility of similar challenges? This is a personal decision. People have different reasons for having children, and some choose not to for various personal or ethical reasons. However, the author might be generalizing their son's experience to all autistic people. \n\nThe author is also projecting their own fears onto a potential future child. They are worried about the child's quality of life and the potential for bullying. But it's important to note that societal attitudes are changing, and there are more supports available now. Also, parents can advocate for their children's needs. \n\nHowever, the author is expressing a personal choice. They are not wrong for not wanting another child, but the way they phrase it could be seen as negative towards autism. The question is whether it's selfish to not want another child because of the possibility of autism. \n\nIn terms of ethics, some might argue that it's a personal choice and they have the right to make that decision. Others might say that it's a form of ableism, assuming that a life with autism is less valuable. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer depends on perspective. If the author is making a personal decision based on their experiences and they're not harming anyone by not having the child, then they might not be in the wrong. However, if their reasoning devalues people with autism, that's a different issue. Since they do love their son and are concerned about his well-being, maybe their intentions are good. \n\nBut the author is also making assumptions about the potential second child's life. The question is whether those assumptions are valid. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because it's their choice, but some might argue A (in the wrong) because of the underlying attitudes towards disability.\n"
