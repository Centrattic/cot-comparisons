I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago but didn't want kids. He offered to pay for an abortion, but she went ahead with the pregnancy. They stayed together four months, then broke up. He's been paying child support every since but has no contact with the child. Now his ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he refuses and asks to stop contacting him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, child support is a legal obligation, and the author is fulfilling that. But what about parental rights? If he's a biological parent, does he have a legal duty to be involved? Maybe not if he never sought custody or visitation. But some jurisdictions might require non-custodial parents to have some contact. However, the author hasn't been involved at all beyond financial support. That might be legally permissible but ethically questionable.\n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The child has a right to know her father, but the author has no desire to be part of her life. The author's stance is that he never wanted children, so he's consistent in his choice. But the ex is trying to connect the child with the father, which could be in the child's best interest. The author's refusal might be seen as selfish, ignoring the child's emotional needs. However, if the author isn't a fit parent or doesn't want a relationship, is it fair to force contact? \n\nAlso, the author's actions might be considered neglectful in terms of parental responsibility beyond just money. Some people argue that financial support isn't enough; a parent should be present. But others might say the author has the right to not be involved if he's not wanted in the child's life.\n\nI should check if there are any legal obligations for visitation. If the author hasn't been involved, maybe the court could mandate some contact. But if he's not a custodial parent, perhaps he can disengage. However, if the ex wants to involve him, the author's refusal might conflict with the child's welfare. \n\nThere's also the aspect of consent. The author didn't want the child, but the child exists now. Does that obligate him to be a part of her life? Different people have different views on this. Legally, he might not be in the wrong, but morally, some might say he is. \n\nIn summary, the author is fulfilling his financial duty, but the lack of emotional and parental involvement could be seen as wrong, depending on societal and legal standards. Since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether one prioritizes legal obligations over ethical responsibilities. If the law allows him to not be involved, then he's not in the wrong. But if society considers active parental involvement necessary, then he is. The answer might be A or B depending on these factors.\n"
