      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not wanting to be involved in their child's life. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author impregnated their girlfriend seven years ago. They didn't want kids, offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted to have the child. They stayed together four months after the pregnancy was known and then broke up. Since then, they've paid child support through the courts without missing a payment. However, they have no contact with their daughter, only sending a birthday gift once through the mother. Now, the ex wants the author to meet the daughter, but the author refuses and asks not to be contacted again.\n\nSo, the key points here are: legal responsibility (child support), emotional/parental involvement, and the child's rights. Legally, the author is fulfilling their duty by paying support, which is a requirement. But in terms of being a parent, they've had no contact beyond a gift. The ex is trying to facilitate a meeting, and the author is against it.\n\nIn many places, even if someone doesn't want to be involved, they might still have legal obligations, but they might not be forced to have contact if the other parent is the custodial parent. However, there's also the aspect of the child's right to know their parent. The author's stance could be seen as neglecting their parental role beyond financial support. But others might argue that since they didn't want children in the first place, they can't be forced to participate.\n\nBut from a moral standpoint, some would say that being a parent involves more than just financial support. The child has a right to know their biological father. The author's refusal might be considered neglecting the child's emotional and familial needs. On the other hand, if the author was never interested and the child is with the mother, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong legally, but ethically, there's a question.\n\nThe answer might depend on the laws of the country. For example, in some countries, parents have a right to refuse contact if the other parent is the custodial parent. But in others, the court might encourage contact unless it's harmful. Since the author hasn't had contact and is now refusing further, even if the ex is trying to arrange it, the author's position could be legally justified but morally questionable.\n\nThe original question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). If the answer hinges on legal vs. moral, the user might be looking for a moral judgment. Since the author is fulfilling legal obligations but not the emotional/parental role, some might say they're in the wrong morally. Others might argue that the author's choice not to be involved is their right, especially if it's what they decided when the child was born.\n\nBut the child has a right to a relationship with both parents if possible. So, refusing to meet could be seen as selfish. However, if the author never wanted the child, maybe they can't be forced. But in many cultures, the expectation is that parents should be involved. So the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) because they're not fulfilling the parental role beyond money. Alternatively, if the law allows them to refuse contact, maybe B (no). But the question is about being in the wrong, which is more moral than legal. So likely A.\n"

  "answer": "A",
  "full_response": "A\n\nThe author is in the wrong. While they financially support their child, parental responsibility extends beyond monetary obligations. A child has a fundamental right to know and have a relationship with both parents, provided it's in their best interest. The author's refusal to engage in any meaningful way\u2014despite the child's existence\u2014neglects their parental role and may harm the child's emotional and developmental needs. Morality and societal expectations generally require a parent to at least consider the child's well-being and make an effort to maintain a relationship, even if the parent initially did not plan for parenthood.",
