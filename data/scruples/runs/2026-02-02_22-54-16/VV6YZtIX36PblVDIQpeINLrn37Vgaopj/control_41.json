I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting any involvement in their child's life. The situation is that the author didn't want children, impregnated his girlfriend, offered an abortion but she chose to keep the child. They stayed together briefly, then broke up. The author has paid child support consistently but has had no contact, only sending a birthday gift through the mother. Now the ex wants to arrange a meeting, and the author refuses.\n\nFirst, legal obligations: The author is fulfilling his financial responsibilities. Child support is typically a legal requirement unless modified, so he's not violating any laws there. But the question is about moral or ethical wrong, not legal.\n\nEthically, the issue is about parental responsibility beyond financial. The author is not a hands-on parent but is providing financially. However, the child might have a right to know their father, even if the author didn't want kids. The author's stance is that he never wanted children and isn't interested in a relationship. But in many societies, there's an expectation that a parent, even a non-custodial one, should have some involvement in the child's life. The author's actions are minimal, just sending a gift. Refusing a meeting could be seen as cutting off any possible relationship the child might want to have in the future.\n\nHowever, the author's initial decision to not want the child, but allowing the mother to proceed with the pregnancy, complicates things. He did consent to the child's existence by not getting an abortion, so some might argue he has a responsibility beyond just money. On the other hand, if the author was forced into parenthood and never wanted it, his feelings are valid, but the child's right to a relationship could be seen as more important.\n\nIt's a tough call. Legally, he's fine. Ethically, it's debatable. Some might say he's in the wrong for not engaging more, while others might empathize with his lack of desire for parenthood. The key points are his consistent support financially, the minimal contact beyond that, and the refusal to meet now. The ex's request could be for the child's benefit, so denying that might be seen as selfish. So, I'm leaning towards A (the author is in the wrong) because a parent has a moral obligation to have some level of relationship with their child, beyond just financial support.\n"
