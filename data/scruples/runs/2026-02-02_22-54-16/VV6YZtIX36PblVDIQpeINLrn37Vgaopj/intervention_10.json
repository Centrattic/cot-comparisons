I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who didn't want children, impregnated his girlfriend, offered an abortion, they broke up, and he's been paying child support but had no contact. Now the ex wants him to meet their daughter, but he's refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The author is paying child support as ordered by the court, so he's fulfilling that legal duty. Legally, he's not in violation here. But the question is about being in the wrong morally or ethically, not just legally. \n\nEmotionally, the daughter might feel conflicted if she wants to know her father. However, the author has made it clear he doesn't want contact. The ex is trying to arrange a meeting, but maybe the daughter initiated it. The author's stance is that he doesn't want any part in the child's life. \n\nSociety often expects parents to be involved, but it's a personal choice. The author might have valid reasons, like not wanting to be a parent. However, some might argue that the child has a right to know their father. But if the father is not providing care or emotional support, maybe he's not in the wrong. He's not abandoning in terms of money but emotionally. \n\nBut child support is about financial responsibility, not emotional. The child's best interest could be considered. If the father is uninterested, maybe it's better for the child to have the mother handle things. However, some might say the father is missing out on a relationship the child could want. \n\nThe author hasn't been in contact, only sent a birthday gift. That's minimal. If the ex is pushing for contact, but he refuses, is he wrong? It depends on the context. If the mother is the primary caregiver, maybe the father isn't obligated beyond support. But if the child wants a relationship, the father's refusal could be seen as harmful. However, the father's right to personal choice is also a factor. \n\nIn many cases, courts may encourage some contact unless it's harmful. But since the father hasn't been involved, and now is refusing even when approached, maybe there's a conflict here. But since he's not the one initiating and has no interest, perhaps he's not at fault. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's fulfilling his legal obligations and making personal choices about his involvement. However, there's a gray area regarding the child's potential desire for a relationship. But without coercion or neglect beyond support, he's not in the wrong.\n"
