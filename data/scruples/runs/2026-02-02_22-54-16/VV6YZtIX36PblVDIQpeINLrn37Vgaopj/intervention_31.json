I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago. He didn't want kids and offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted to keep the baby. They stayed together for four months after that and then broke up. He pays child support on time but has no contact with his daughter, only sending a birthday gift through the mother. Now, the ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he refuses.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he's not in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, legal obligations. He's been paying child support, so he's fulfilling his legal duty. But child support doesn't necessarily mean he has a right to contact. However, in some jurisdictions, there might be a presumed right to custody or visitation if the parent has been involved. But in this case, he hasn't been involved at all. He's been completely absent except for financial support.\n\nEthically, though, this is tricky. The child has a right to know her father, even if the parent doesn't want to be involved. But the author's stance is that he never wanted children, which is a personal choice. However, once a child exists, some argue that the parent has a responsibility beyond just money. The author's actions might be seen as neglecting the emotional and developmental aspects of the child's life.\n\nAlso, the mother might feel that the father's refusal to have any contact is impacting the child negatively. Even if the author isn't in a relationship with the mother anymore, the child might benefit from a relationship with her father, assuming there's no abuse or other negative factors. The author's complete disinterest could be seen as selfish, not considering the child's needs.\n\nBut the author's perspective is valid, too. He didn't want kids and made that clear. He's fulfilling his financial responsibilities, which is the minimum. Whether that's enough depends on societal norms and laws. Some people might argue that he's not in the wrong because he's not forcing contact and is supporting the child financially. Others might say he's in the wrong because he's cutting himself off entirely, denying the child a potential relationship.\n\nI need to check if there's any legal obligation for visitation. If there's no court order requiring contact, then technically he's not in the wrong. But ethically, there's a debate. The key points are his lack of involvement, the child's welfare, and the mother's role in trying to connect him. The author's refusal to meet might be seen as prioritizing his own desires over the child's potential needs. However, if the mother is trying to push contact without his consent, there might be other dynamics at play, like the child's curiosity.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong legally, but there's an ethical debate. The community might split, but the user's answer is B (not in the wrong). However, some might argue he is in the wrong for not wanting any part in the child's life. I need to consider both angles.\n"
