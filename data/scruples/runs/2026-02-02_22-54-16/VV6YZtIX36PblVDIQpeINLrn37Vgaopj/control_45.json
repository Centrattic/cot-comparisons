      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago but never wanted children. He offered to pay for an abortion, but she decided to keep the baby. They stayed together four months post-pregnancy and then broke up. He's been paying child support consistently but hasn't had any contact with the child. Now, the ex wants him to meet the daughter, which he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, parents have rights and responsibilities regardless of the circumstances of the pregnancy or relationship. The author is fulfilling the financial obligation but is avoiding any personal involvement. However, child custody laws often prioritize the child's right to know both parents, especially if the father is fit and willing. But since the father has shown no interest, maybe the court hasn't ordered contact, and the mother hasn't pursued it. So legally, he might be okay as long as he's meeting support obligations.\n\nEthically, this is trickier. The child has a right to a relationship with both parents, but the father's perspective is that he never wanted children and isn't interested. It's important to consider the child's well-being. Some might argue that the father is being selfish, not considering the child's future need to know their biological father. Others might say he has the right to not be a parent, especially if he never wanted it. \n\nThe author's actions show a lack of engagement beyond financial support, which is legally required but ethically questionable. By not allowing contact, he might be limiting the child's opportunities to have a relationship with him. The fact that he sends a birthday gift with specific instructions suggests he doesn't want the child to have a real connection with him, which could be seen as neglectful or inconsiderate from an ethical standpoint. \n\nHowever, the situation also depends on the original relationship and the reasons for the breakup. If the author was not a willing parent and the mother chose to keep the child, the father might feel he has no obligation beyond support. But many argue that being a parent is a lifelong commitment, even if the child was unplanned. The author's refusal to meet the child, especially when the mother is trying to facilitate it, could be seen as not fulfilling his parental role. \n\nI should check if there are any legal precedents or cultural norms that might influence this. In some jurisdictions, if a parent has been absent for a long time, their rights could be terminated, but that's a legal process. The mother's desire to introduce the child might be valid, but the father's right to refuse could be protected if there's no court order for contact. \n\nThe key points are: the father has been paying support but avoiding contact. The child is now a bit older (7 years), and the mother is trying to connect the child with the father. The author's stance is that he never wanted children and isn't interested. The question is whether this makes him the asshole. \n\nOpinions might be divided. Some would say he's wrong because a child deserves a relationship with both parents. Others might say he's not wrong because he was given a choice to be a parent and chose not to, but is fulfilling legal duties. \n\nIn the AITA context, the community often weighs intentions and actions. The author's actions are only the minimum required legally, but ethically, he might be considered in the wrong for not engaging with the child's life beyond money. The fact that he's being contacted again after years suggests that the mother is trying to change his stance, which might be seen as an opportunity for a positive relationship. \n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical angles, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because even though he's paying child support, a complete lack of engagement beyond that is neglecting the child's emotional needs. However, if there's no legal requirement for contact, the answer could be B (not wrong). But the AITA subreddit usually looks at the heart of the matter, and many people there would likely say AITA because the child's right to know their father is important.\n"
