I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author impregnated a girlfriend, didn't want kids, offered to pay for an abortion but she wanted the child. They broke up, he's been paying child support but has no contact. Now the ex wants him to meet their daughter, and he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, child support obligations don't necessarily require a parent to have contact with the child. So legally, he's fulfilling his duty by paying. But what about parental rights? If he's the legal father, there might be laws about visitation. However, if he relinquished parental rights or if the child was placed with the mother, that's different. The post doesn't mention if he has any legal visitation rights. If he's not the legal parent, then maybe he has no right to refuse contact. But if he is the legal father, then maybe the mother is trying to involve him, and his refusal could be seen as avoiding responsibility beyond financial.\n\nMoral or ethical standpoint: The author doesn't want any part in the child's life. Some might argue that as a parent, you have a duty beyond money to be involved. Others might say he wasn't prepared for parenthood and shouldn't be forced to be part of the child's life against his will. The child might suffer from not having a relationship with their father. However, if the author is not interested, forcing him into a relationship could be harmful. \n\nThe author is paying child support, which is a responsibility. But emotional and relational support is another aspect. There's also the aspect of the child's well-being. Many people believe that both parents should be involved if possible. However, since he didn't want the child and the mother wanted it, maybe his lack of interest isn't his fault. Still, once a child is born, some responsibilities extend beyond money.\n\nThe answer here depends on cultural, legal, and personal ethics. Legally, maybe he's not in the wrong if he's not the custodial parent. But morally, some might say he has a responsibility. However, the community on AITA often has mixed views. In similar cases, sometimes people are seen as in the right if they are fulfilling financial obligations but not involved otherwise. Others argue that emotional absence is also a form of neglect.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer could go either way. But given the information, the author hasn't done anything illegal. He's paying support and the mother is the one raising the child. His refusal to meet might be seen as selfish, but if he wasn't prepared for parenthood, it's a tough situation. Since the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, the answer might lean towards B. However, some might argue he's in the wrong for not being involved. But in many AITA scenarios, if you fulfill your legal duties (child support) and the other parent is managing the child's care, the non-custodial parent isn't in the wrong for not wanting contact. So probably answer B.\n"
