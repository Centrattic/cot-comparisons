I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The scenario is that the person impregnated their girlfriend by accident, didn't want children, offered to pay for an abortion which she refused, then they broke up. He set up child support through the courts and has never had contact with the child, only sending a birthday gift through the ex. Now the ex wants him to meet the daughter, and he's refusing again.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, legal obligations. He's been paying child support, so he's meeting that. Legally, he's doing what's required. But what about the emotional and moral aspects? He didn't want the child, didn't want to be a father, and has had zero contact except a gift. Is it wrong to not want a relationship with the child?\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, maybe he's not wrong. But society often expects parents to have some relationship with their children unless there are valid reasons (like abuse or neglect). In this case, he's not abusive, just not interested. So is it moral to cut off completely?\n\nThe ex is trying to facilitate a meeting, perhaps because the child is curious about the father. The author is refusing. If the child has a right to know their parent, then the author's refusal could be seen as neglecting that right. However, he might argue that he didn't want to be a father and has a right to not be involved. But then, once a child is born, does the parent have a duty to be involved regardless of their initial wishes?\n\nAlso, sending a gift anonymously might be a nice gesture, but it doesn't substitute for a real relationship. The child might feel confused or deprived of a father figure. The author's lack of contact could be seen as emotionally harmful to the child, even if the mother is managing on her own.\n\nBut maybe he's being realistic. If he's not emotionally prepared to be a father, forcing a relationship could be harmful. However, there's a middle ground. Maybe limited contact, or supervised visits if necessary. But the author is completely disinterested, which is a different matter.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while some might understand not wanting to be a parent, others would see it as abandoning a duty. The key points are whether he's neglecting the child's well-being and if his actions are in the child's best interest. Even if he doesn't want to be a father, the child has a right to know their father, especially as they grow older.\n\nSo, considering all that, is he in the wrong? Legally, maybe not. But morally, it's debatable. The community on AITA would likely split, but since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer might lean towards A because he's refusing contact that the child might need. However, others might side with B, respecting his choice. But given that he's had no contact and refuses any, I think the consensus is that he is in the wrong. Hence, answer A.\n"
