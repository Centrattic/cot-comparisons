I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author impregnated his girlfriend, didn't want kids, offered to pay for an abortion but she wanted to keep the child. They broke up after four months, and he's been paying child support but has no contact with the child. Now the ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he refuses.\n\nFirst, legal obligations: He's been paying child support, so he's fulfilling that part. But in many places, child support is about the child's needs, not just the parent's responsibility. However, parental rights might include visitation unless a court has restricted it. Since he hasn't had contact, maybe there's no court order for visitation. But if the ex is trying to arrange contact now, is he legally required to participate?\n\nEmotionally, the child has a right to know their father, even if he didn't want kids. The author is avoiding any relationship beyond financial support. That might be seen as selfish, especially as the child grows older. The daughter might be curious about her father, and his refusal could limit her ability to understand her heritage or form a relationship.\n\nEthically, while the author wasn't prepared for parenthood, once a child exists, there's a moral obligation to be part of their life. The author's actions might be seen as neglecting the child's well-being for his own convenience. Even if he didn't want kids, the child has a right to a relationship with both parents unless there's a valid reason to restrict it (like harm, which isn't mentioned here).\n\nThe ex's role: If the ex is facilitating contact, maybe the author's refusal is preventing the child from knowing their father. However, if the author has a history of not being involved, maybe the ex is trying to force a relationship now. But the child's interest should be the priority.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The author didn't want the child, so he might feel forced into parenthood. But once the child is born, the legal and ethical responsibilities don't end. His lack of involvement might be harmful in the long run. The child might feel rejected or confused.\n\nSo, considering all aspects, the author is likely in the wrong. He's fulfilling financial duty but neglecting the child's emotional and social needs. The correct answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
