I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author says they got their girlfriend pregnant seven years ago. They didn't want kids and offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted to have the child. They stayed together for four months after, then broke up. The author paid child support as ordered by the courts and never missed a payment. They've had no contact with their daughter and only sent a birthday gift once. Now, the ex wants the author to meet the daughter, but the author refuses and asks not to be contacted again. They're unsure if the daughter asked or the ex initiated.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants my opinion. So, answer A or B. Let me think about the legal and ethical aspects here.\n\nLegally, the author is fulfilling their obligation by paying child support. Courts typically require financial support but not necessarily involvement. So legally, they're not wrong. But ethically, is there a duty to have a relationship with the child? The author has no contact, which some might see as neglectful. However, if the parent didn't want children, maybe their right to disengage is valid. \n\nBut in many places, parental rights include not just financial but also visitation unless there are issues with the parent. However, the author hasn't been involved. The ex might want the child to have a relationship with the father, but the author is refusing. If the ex is trying to arrange it, maybe the author's refusal could be seen as denying the child a relationship. But the author hasn't been involved for years, so suddenly being asked to meet now could be complicated. \n\nAlso, the author might have valid reasons for not wanting to be involved. They weren't in a relationship with the mother anymore and never wanted children. But the child has a right to know their father, some might argue. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. Legally, they're meeting their obligations. Ethically, some might say the child deserves a relationship. But others might respect the parent's right to choose non-involvement. The author's stance is consistent, but the question is if they're in the wrong. \n\nGiven that the author is fulfilling legal duties but refusing to have a relationship, it's a matter of perspective. Since the question is about being in the wrong, and legally they're not at fault, maybe the answer is B. However, if the law in their jurisdiction requires some level of involvement, but the author isn't in violation, then B. So I think the answer is B.\n"
