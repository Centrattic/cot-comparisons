I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who impregnated his girlfriend, didn't want children, offered to pay for an abortion but she chose to have the child. They broke up after four months, he's been paying child support but has no contact. Now the ex wants him to meet the daughter, and he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, he's fulfilling his obligation by paying child support, which is a key responsibility. But in many places, parents do have some legal right to contact their child unless there's a court order preventing it. However, since he hasn't been involved, maybe the mother could have a say. But if there's no court order restricting contact, then his refusal might be legally questionable. But the question is about being \"in the wrong\" morally or ethically, not just legally.\n\nEthically, there's the argument that a parent has a responsibility to their child beyond financial support. Emotional and psychological support are important for the child's well-being. The author has chosen to remain completely detached, which might be considered selfish or neglectful from a moral standpoint. However, he was against having the child from the start and might have genuine reasons for not wanting to be involved, such as not being suited for parenting.\n\nOn the other hand, the child has a right to know their father, even if the father initially didn't want the child. The mother's desire to introduce the child to the father could be in the child's best interest. The author's refusal might be seen as prioritizing his own wishes over the child's potential needs.\n\nBut the user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong. So, the answer could be B (No), but I need to weigh the arguments. It's possible that while the author is legally compliant, he's ethically questionable. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which is more moral. If the law requires contact, but he's not following that, then maybe A (Yes). But if there's no legal obligation for contact, then it's a personal choice. The answer might depend on the jurisdiction, but since it's not specified, we can assume that child support is the main legal requirement here.\n\nSo, the author is meeting the legal requirement by paying support but not being involved. Ethically, it's a gray area. He might be in the wrong for not wanting to be part of the child's life, but if he made it clear from the start and the mother agreed, maybe not. It's a tough call. The answer could be B (No), as the author is fulfilling his financial duty and the mother is the one arranging the contact. However, some might argue that the father's refusal is inconsiderate of the child's needs. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that he's not violating any laws and the mother hasn't legally enforced contact, maybe he's not in the wrong. So, the answer is B."
