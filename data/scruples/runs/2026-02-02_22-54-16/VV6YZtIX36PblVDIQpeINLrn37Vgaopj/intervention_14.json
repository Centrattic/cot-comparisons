I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago but never wanted children, so he offered to pay for an abortion she declined. They stayed together four months, broke up, and he's been paying child support without contact. Now the ex wants him to meet their daughter, but he's refusing.\n\nFirst, the user thinks the author is not wrong. I need to evaluate this. Legal obligations: he's been paying child support, so he's meeting that. But does he have a responsibility beyond that? Well, in many places, child support is about financial responsibility, not emotional or parental involvement. However, some jurisdictions might require reasonable contact if the parent is capable, but it can vary. The author says he's never wanted children and has been actively avoiding contact. The child is now seven years old, so maybe the mother is trying to connect the child with the father now. \n\nEthically, some might argue that a child has a right to know both parents, but the father has no interest. The mother's role here is to facilitate contact if she thinks it's in the child's best interest. But the father's right to disengage could be seen as valid if he was never part of the child's life. However, the court might have different views. If there are no court orders for visitation, maybe he's within his rights. But if the court expects some parental involvement, he might be in the wrong. Legally, it's about the support, not necessarily contact. Emotionally, it's a different story. \n\nThe author is not meeting the child, but not interfering with the mother. However, the ex is trying to arrange a meeting now. If the father is refusing any contact, could that be harmful? Some people might say yes, that the child deserves to know their father if he's willing. But the father has no desire for a relationship. It's a tough call. In some places, the court might require the father to have some contact if it's in the child's best interest. If there's no court order, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the question is about being in the wrong morally, not legally. The user is looking for a moral judgment. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's fulfilling financial obligations, even though he's not involved. But some might argue he should at least consider the child's wishes. Since the child is seven, maybe she's curious, but the father's stance is that he never wanted kids. It's a complex situation, but the user's perspective is that the author isn't wrong. I think the answer aligns with B.\n"
