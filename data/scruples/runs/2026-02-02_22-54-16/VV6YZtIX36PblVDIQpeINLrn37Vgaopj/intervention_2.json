I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a child with his girlfriend, didn't want kids, offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted to keep the baby. They stayed together briefly, broke up, and he's been paying child support but has no contact with the child. Now, the ex wants him to meet their daughter, but he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal obligations. The author is paying child support, which is a legal requirement once established in court. But in terms of custody or visitation rights, unless there's a court order for him to have contact, he might not be obligated to see the child. However, in many places, even if there's no custody, the parent still has rights to some involvement, especially as the child grows older. But the author has chosen not to have any contact, only sending a birthday gift through the mother.\n\nNext, the ethical aspect. The author never wanted children, so he's not a negligent parent in terms of financial responsibility. However, some might argue that a parent has a duty to be involved in their child's life, regardless of initial desires. There's a difference between financial support and emotional presence. The author's stance could be seen as selfish because the child might benefit from knowing their father, even if he's not the traditional involved parent.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the mother's role. She wanted the child and presumably has been raising her. The author might feel that he's fulfilling his role by covering expenses. However, if the child is now old enough to express interest in knowing their father, the author's refusal could be seen as harmful. The ex's request might be in the child's best interest, especially if the child is curious about the father.\n\nLegally, depending on jurisdiction, the father might have the right to refuse contact if there's no court order for visitation. But there's also the possibility of the mother seeking a court order to require visitation, especially if the child's well-being is at stake. The author's refusal could be challenged in court if the mother believes it's in the child's best interest.\n\nEthically, the author's position could be seen as valid if he's not in a position to provide care or if there's a history of conflict. However, completely cutting off contact might be seen as inconsiderate of the child's needs. The fact that the author sends a gift might indicate some minimal connection, but it's not a substitute for a relationship.\n\nIn some cultures or legal systems, a parent's right to disengage is limited once a child is born. The author's stance might be legally defensible but ethically questionable. The key points are whether there's a legal obligation to have contact and whether the author's actions are considered in the child's best interest.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer could vary. Legally, maybe not in the wrong, but ethically, it's a gray area. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, so depending on the jurisdiction and specific laws, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) if there's no legal requirement for contact. But if the law requires some level of involvement, then A. But given the information, since he's only been paying support and there's no mention of court-ordered visitation, B might be the answer. However, I should check if in most cases, even without custody, a parent can't be forced to have contact unless the court orders it. So the author isn't in the wrong legally, but ethically, it's debatable. Since the user is asking about being in the wrong, and the question is more about moral responsibility rather than legal, but the options are A or B, the answer would be B if the user's jurisdiction allows it, but in many places, the parent isn't in the wrong for not wanting contact unless ordered. However, some ethical viewpoints might say he is in the wrong. But the user thinks he's not, so maybe the answer is B.\n"
