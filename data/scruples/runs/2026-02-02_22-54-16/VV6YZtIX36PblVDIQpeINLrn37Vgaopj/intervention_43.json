I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Alright, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to be involved in their child's life. The situation involves the author impregnating his girlfriend, not wanting children, offering to pay for an abortion which she refused, then breaking up. He has been paying child support but has no contact, only sending a birthday gift via the mother. Now the ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, he's been paying child support, so he's fulfilling his legal obligations. The court settled the child support, so he's not missing payments. However, in many jurisdictions, parental rights aren't just about financial support but also about custody and visitation. But since he's not the custodial parent, maybe his rights are more limited here. But the question is about moral or ethical wrongdoing, not just legal.\n\nEthically, the author has chosen not to have any relationship with his child. This raises questions about parental responsibility. While he's providing financially, emotional and personal involvement is a different aspect. Some might argue that a parent has a duty to be involved in their child's life, not just financially. Others might say that if the father never wanted children and the mother chose to keep the child, then his lack of involvement isn't his fault, especially if the mother is the primary caregiver.\n\nThe author's actions include sending a birthday gift, which is a minimal gesture. However, he's not engaging in any meaningful way. The mother is reaching out to connect the child with the father, which the author refuses. This could be seen as the author avoiding responsibility beyond financial obligations.\n\nAnother angle is the child's right to know their father. Depending on cultural or personal beliefs, some might say the author is denying the child a relationship. However, if the author was never present during the child's upbringing and has no desire to be involved, it's a complex situation. The mother's role here is also important; she might be the one pushing for the relationship now.\n\nConsidering societal views, there's a spectrum. Some people believe that fathers should be involved regardless of circumstances, while others might respect a person's choice not to have children if they never wanted them. The key points here are consent (the author didn't want the child) and the mother's decision to keep the child despite his wishes.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author is facing a conflict between his personal desires and societal expectations. He's not being negligent financially but is disengaged emotionally. The question then is whether fulfilling financial duties absolves him of other responsibilities.\n\nI think the answer depends on the perspective. Legally, he's compliant, but ethically, there's room for debate. Some might argue he's in the wrong for not being involved, others might see his stance as respecting his own desires and the mother's decision. However, considering the child's well-being, the author's disengagement could be seen as a moral failing. On the other hand, if he's not being a harmful presence, just absent, it's a different story. The mother is the one raising the child, so maybe the author's role is more passive. But the child's right to a relationship is a factor here. Overall, the answer isn't black and white, but in many ethical frameworks, parental involvement is considered important, so the author might be in the wrong.\n"
