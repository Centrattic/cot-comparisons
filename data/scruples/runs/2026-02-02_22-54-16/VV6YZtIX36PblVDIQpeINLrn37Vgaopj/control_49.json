I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who never wanted children, impregnated his girlfriend, offered an abortion but she wanted the child. They broke up after four months, he pays child support but has no contact with his daughter. He sends a birthday gift through the mother and refuses to meet when the mother suggests it now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, child support is a legal obligation, and the father has legal rights and responsibilities. Even if he doesn't want contact, the law might require some form of involvement. Also, depending on the country or state, the mother might have the authority to arrange contact, and the father's refusal could be challenged in court. If the mother wants to facilitate contact and he's blocking it, that could be an issue.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The child has a right to know their father, even if he doesn't want to be involved. The father is providing financially but not emotionally or relationally. Some people might argue that he's fulfilling part of his duty but not all. The mother might be trying to connect the child with the father, and the father's refusal could be seen as neglecting the child's emotional needs.\n\nThe father's position is that he never wanted children. But once a child is born, he has responsibilities. Even if he doesn't want a relationship, maybe he should at least be open to some involvement for the child's sake. The fact that he sends a gift anonymously might not be sufficient. The child might not understand the situation, and the mother's attempt to arrange a meeting could be in the child's best interest.\n\nHowever, the father's lack of interest could be seen as a personal choice. If he's not endangering the child or being abusive, some might say it's his right to not be involved. But others might say that as a parent, you have an obligation beyond just money. The line between legal obligations and moral responsibilities can be blurry here.\n\nI should also consider cultural perspectives. In some cultures, parental involvement is expected regardless of initial intentions. In others, financial support might be considered enough. The answer might depend on societal norms and legal standards in the specific jurisdiction.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the father is fulfilling the financial part but not the relational. Legally, he might not be in the wrong if the courts only required child support. Ethically, there's a strong case that he's neglecting his parental duties beyond finances. The mother's attempt to connect them could be for the child's benefit, and the father's refusal might be impacting the child negatively. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) ethically, even if legally he's not.\n"
