      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author impregnated his girlfriend, didn't want kids, and offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to keep the baby, and they stayed together for four months before breaking up. He set up child support through the courts and never missed a payment. He hasn't had contact with his daughter, only sending a birthday gift via the mother. Now, the ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he refuses and asks her not to contact him again.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about legal obligations versus personal involvement. Legally, he's fulfilling his duty by paying child support. The question is whether that's enough. Some might argue that a child has a right to know their father, but others might say it's his right to not be involved. The author seems to have made his choice when he didn't want children and followed through with financial responsibility. The fact that he's not seeking contact but is providing support could be seen as meeting his legal obligations without overstepping his personal boundaries.\n\nBut wait, is there a moral obligation beyond what's legally required? The ex is trying to arrange a meeting, and the author is dismissing that. Some people might feel that even if he doesn't want a relationship, he should allow the child to know about him if the mother is facilitating it. However, the author isn't blocking the child from meeting him; he's just not interested. There's a difference between being a hands-on parent and being completely absent except for financial support. The author might be in the wrong if the court initially mandated some level of involvement, but based on the info, he didn't miss payments and the arrangement was settled through the courts. Since the courts didn't require contact, maybe he's not in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the fact that he sent a birthday gift shows some minimal acknowledgment. But the ex is now trying to push for a meeting. The author's stance is clear: he doesn't want any part in his child's life. Legally, he's compliant. Morally, it's more nuanced. However, the user is asking if he's in the wrong, and based on the information given, there's no indication he violated any laws or court orders. So, the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
