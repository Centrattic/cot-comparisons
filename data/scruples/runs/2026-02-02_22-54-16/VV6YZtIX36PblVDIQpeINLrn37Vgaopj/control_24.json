I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a child from a past relationship, and the person has never wanted children. They offered to pay for an abortion but the ex wanted to keep the child. After breaking up, they've paid child support but had no contact. Now the ex wants to arrange a meeting, and the person is refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, child support obligations don't require the parent to have contact. So legally, the author might not be in the wrong. But legally and morally are different. \n\nMorally, it's tricky. The author is the biological father, so some might argue they have a responsibility to be involved in the child's life. However, the author never wanted children and has been paying support, which shows some responsibility. But completely cutting off contact might be seen as neglectful. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the child's well-being. Children often benefit from having a relationship with both parents, but if the father is not willing, maybe it's better to not force contact. However, the child has the right to know their father, but the father's right to privacy and not wanting to be involved is also a factor.\n\nThe ex is trying to arrange a meeting, which the author is resisting. The author might be worried about being forced into a relationship they don't want. But the ex might feel the child deserves to know her father.\n\nIt's a complex situation. Legally, the author isn't in the wrong because they're fulfilling financial obligations. Morally, it's debatable. Some may argue that the author's lack of involvement is harmful, but others might respect their choice. The answer could depend on cultural or personal beliefs. However, given the information, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, so answer B.\n"
