I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago. He doesn't want kids and offered to pay for an abortion, but she decided to have the child. They stayed together for four months after the pregnancy was known and then broke up. He agreed to pay child support through the courts and hasn't missed a payment. He's had no contact with his daughter since, only sending birthday gifts via the mother with instructions to say it's from her. Recently, the ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he refuses and asks her not to contact him again. He's unsure if the child asked about him or the ex is pushing for it.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. The question is whether he is in the wrong, answer A or B.\n\nFirst, legal perspective: child support is a legal obligation. He's been fulfilling that, so he's not violating any laws. But what about parental rights? In many places, once a child is born, the parent has certain rights and responsibilities. Even if they don't want to be involved, they might still have a legal duty to participate in the child's life to some extent, depending on the jurisdiction. But since he agreed to pay child support through the courts, maybe that's all he's required to do? I'm not sure. In some cases, if a parent is uninvolved, the courts might enforce a relationship if the child is old enough, but the child is only 7. Maybe the mother has sole custody, and the author isn't involved. Legally, he's not missing out on custody, just financial support. But maybe there's a legal expectation for contact?\n\nEthically, even if legally okay, is it wrong to not want any part in the child's life? The author isn't providing emotional support, time, or involvement. The child has a right to know their father, even if the father isn't interested. The mother might feel it's in the child's best interest to have a relationship with the father, especially if the child is curious. The author's actions could be seen as emotionally neglectful. But he's not forcing the mother to do anything; he's just choosing not to participate beyond financial support. However, if the child wants to know him, is the father's refusal harmful? The author mentions he doesn't know if the child or the ex initiated the contact. That's a key point. If the child is reaching out, the father's refusal might be seen as dismissive or not honoring the child's wishes. But if the ex is pushing, maybe the child hasn't actually expressed interest yet.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he never wanted children. He did offer to terminate the pregnancy, which the mother declined. After the breakup, he's made it clear he doesn't want to be involved. But does the father's right to refuse contact extend to the child's potential interest? Some argue that a child's right to a relationship with both parents is important, even if one parent is uninterested. However, if the mother is the one pushing for contact without the child's input, maybe the author is justified in not wanting to be involved. But the scenario is that the ex is arranging the meeting, and if the child is asking questions, the father's absence might affect the child's understanding of their own family.\n\nAnother angle: the author's actions. He sends a gift but with instructions to say it's from the mother. That seems like he's trying to distance himself, which might not be healthy for the child. Even if he's not interested in a relationship, perhaps the child deserves to know about their father's existence and have the option to connect, especially as they grow older. The author's refusal to meet the child could be seen as selfish, but he might not feel a responsibility beyond financial support. \n\nIn some cultures or legal systems, a parent can disengage if there's a cut-off that's been accepted by the court or if the parent is found to be an unfit parent, but the author doesn't mention any legal action or court order regarding contact. So legally, he might be meeting his obligations by paying support, but ethically, there's a gray area. The child's well-being is a factor. If the child is curious and expressing interest, the father's refusal could be harmful. However, if the child is not interested, maybe it's not the father's problem. \n\nThe author's initial offer to pay for an abortion suggests he didn't want the child, and the mother chose to have it. So the child's existence is a result of the mother's decision. The father might feel he has no responsibility beyond financial support. But the child has a right to know their biological father. The author is denying that right. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the law requires financial support but doesn't mandate contact, he might not be legally wrong. But socially and morally, many might say he has a responsibility to be involved. However, if the mother is the one seeking contact and the father is not, and the child is being raised well by the mother, maybe the father's stance is less wrong. But if the child is reaching out, the father's refusal could be considered neglectful. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the child is expressing interest. The author isn't sure, so it's ambiguous. But in general, parental relationships are important for a child's development. Even if the father isn't interested, the child might need that connection. Therefore, the author's refusal to meet the child could be seen as ethically wrong, even if legally acceptable. However, if the ex is the one pushing and the child is not interested, maybe the author is justified. But given the child is 7, they might be aware of their father's existence and curious. The author's lack of any contact beyond a gift could be harmful. \n\nI'm leaning towards the answer being A (the author is in the wrong) because while he's fulfilling financial obligations, he's avoiding any emotional or personal involvement, which is a significant part of parenthood. However, if the mother is the primary parent and the child is being raised well, his role might be considered minimal. It's a tough call. But given that the child is now 7 and the ex is trying to arrange a meeting, the author's refusal is likely seen as morally wrong by many, even if legally he's not. So, answer A.\n"
