I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be part of their child's life. The situation is that the author impregnated their ex-girlfriend seven years ago, didn't want kids, offered an abortion but the ex wanted to keep the baby. They broke up after four months but the author pays child support and has no contact otherwise. Now the ex wants them to meet their daughter, but the author refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In most places, parents do have legal rights and responsibilities. The author pays child support, which is a legal obligation, but does that mean they have a right to be involved? Maybe not necessarily. If the author is not the legal custodial parent, the court might not require them to have contact. However, depending on the jurisdiction, there might be provisions about visitation or parental rights. But the author hasn't been involved, which could be a problem if the child's well-being is at stake.\n\nEthically, this is more complex. Even if legally not obligated, most people would argue that a parent has a moral duty to their child. The author is providing financially but not emotionally or relationally. The child might suffer from having an absent parent. The ex is trying to arrange a meeting, possibly because the child is curious about the father. The author's refusal could be seen as selfish or neglectful, especially since the child has a right to know their parent.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they never wanted children. While that's personal, once a child exists, the parent can't just opt out entirely. The author is fulfilling the financial part but ignoring the emotional and social aspects of parenthood. This could be harmful to the child's development and well-being.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of the child's wishes. If the daughter is old enough to ask about her father, the author's absence might affect her. The author's refusal to meet might be impacting the child's ability to have a relationship with them. Even if the author isn't interested, maybe a minimal level of involvement is necessary for the child's benefit.\n\nHowever, the author might have valid reasons. Maybe they are not emotionally ready to be a parent, or the circumstances of the pregnancy were not ideal. But regardless of the reasons, the child still has a right to a relationship with both parents if possible. The author's stance could be considered negligent in terms of parental responsibility beyond just financial support.\n\nIn many cultures and legal systems, the parent's role isn't just about money; it's about being present in the child's life. So, even if the author isn't legally compelled to meet, ethically, they might be in the wrong for not wanting to be part of their child's life at all. The answer could lean towards A (in the wrong) because of the ethical duty to the child.\n"
