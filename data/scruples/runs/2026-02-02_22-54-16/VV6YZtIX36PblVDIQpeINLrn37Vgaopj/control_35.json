I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a father who didn't want children, impregnated his girlfriend, offered to pay for an abortion but she went ahead with the pregnancy. They broke up after four months, and since then he's paid child support but had no contact with the child. Now the ex wants to arrange a meeting, and he's refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, a parent has the responsibility to provide financially for their child, even if they don't want to be involved. The father has been consistent with child support, so he's meeting that legal obligation. However, parental rights often include the right to be involved in the child's life, but some states might have laws about visitation rights even if the parents aren't married.\n\nEthically, this is trickier. The father didn't want the child and has never been involved beyond financial support. The child has a right to know their father, especially as they grow older. The father is denying that relationship entirely, which could be seen as neglecting his parental responsibilities beyond financial ones. But some might argue that since he didn't want the child and isn't forcing contact, he's not in the wrong. However, others would say that being a parent is more than just money, and he's depriving the child of a relationship.\n\nAlso, the ex-wife is trying to facilitate contact, perhaps on the child's initiative. The father might be infringing on the child's right to know their father. But if the father has no interest in being a part of the child's life, can he be considered wrong? It depends on societal views. Some might say yes, he's avoiding responsibility, others might say it's his choice as a parent.\n\nI should check if there's any legal obligation for contact. In some jurisdictions, there's no legal requirement for a parent to have contact, only financial support. So legally, he's not in the wrong. But ethically, there's a debate. The question is whether the user is in the wrong, which is more about moral judgment. So if the community judges him as an \"asshole,\" AITA style, it's likely A (yes, in the wrong) because he's denying the child a relationship. But if people think it's his choice, then B (not in the wrong). Need to weigh these factors.\n"
