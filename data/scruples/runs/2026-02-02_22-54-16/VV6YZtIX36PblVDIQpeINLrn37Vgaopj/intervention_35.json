I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who didn't want to have a child and has been distant since the birth, only providing financial support. Now his ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he refuses contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, parents have legal obligations to provide child support, which he's done. But do they have a legal obligation to be involved in the child's life? I think legally, child support is the main requirement unless there's a court order for custody or visitation. Since he didn't get involved after the breakup, unless there's a court-ordered visitation, he might not be legally wrong.\n\nEthically, it's more complex. The child has a right to know their father, but the father never wanted to be a parent and has remained distant. The mother might be trying to connect the child with the father, which is a common desire for many single parents. However, the father's stance is that he never wanted children and doesn't want to be part of her life. There's a debate here between the father's right to make that choice and the child's right to a relationship with both parents.\n\nSome might argue that the father is in the wrong because he's avoiding a parental role, which could affect the child. Others might say he's not in the wrong because he was clear about his intentions and has fulfilled his financial responsibilities. The key points are his consistent non-involvement and the child's potential lack of a father figure.\n\nI need to check if there are any legal requirements for visitation. If the father hasn't been involved and the mother is seeking to change that, maybe the court could require contact, but the father's refusal might be a legal issue then. However, without a court order, he might not be in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical angles, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong legally, but there's ethical debate. The user's own opinion is that the author isn't wrong, and the question is whether the answer is A or B. Given that the father hasn't missed support and there's no legal requirement for contact unless ordered, the answer is likely B.\n"
