      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the user impregnated their girlfriend seven years ago. They didn't want kids, so they offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted to keep the child. They stayed together for four months after the pregnancy was confirmed and then broke up. After the breakup, the user has been paying child support as ordered by the courts without missing a payment. However, they have no contact with their daughter and only send a birthday gift anonymously. Recently, the ex wants the user to meet their daughter, but the user refuses and asks not to be contacted about it again.\n\nThe user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting any part in their child's life. They mentioned they've never wanted children and have fulfilled their financial obligations. The key points here are legal responsibilities, parental rights, and ethical considerations.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many jurisdictions, parents have a legal duty to provide financial support for their children, which the user has done. However, parental rights can also include visitation or contact with the child, but these can be complicated, especially when the parents are no longer together. If the user hasn't been involved, the court might require them to have some contact if it's in the child's best interest, but the user hasn't faced any such court orders yet. They've just been avoiding contact on their own.\n\nEthically, this is more subjective. Some people might argue that a parent has a moral obligation to be present in a child's life, regardless of their initial wishes. Others might say that if the parent is fulfilling financial responsibilities and the other parent is managing the child's upbringing, it's not entirely wrong for the parent to choose not to be involved emotionally. The child's right to know about their father could be a factor here, but the user's personal feelings about not wanting children are also a factor.\n\nThe user's ex is trying to facilitate a meeting, but the user is resistant. If the child is interested in meeting the father, there could be an argument that the father's refusal is denying the child a relationship. However, the user claims they've never shown interest and have made that clear. The user might not feel they can suddenly be a good parent now, especially if they never wanted children to begin with.\n\nAnother angle is the well-being of the child. If the child is happy and well-cared for by the mother, maybe the lack of a father figure isn't causing harm. But if the child is curious or seeks a relationship, the father's refusal could be seen as neglecting part of the child's needs.\n\nIn terms of legal consequences, if there's no court order mandating contact, the user isn't breaking the law. But if the ex takes the matter to court, the court might decide that the child's best interest requires some form of contact, which could force the user to comply. However, the user hasn't faced that yet.\n\nSo, putting this together: Legally, the user hasn't done anything wrong by paying child support. Ethically, it's more complex. The user's stance is based on personal choice and circumstances, but the child's interests are a counterpoint. The answer hinges on whether fulfilling financial obligations is sufficient or if there's an expectation of emotional involvement. The community might be divided, but the user isn't necessarily in the wrong legally, though some might criticize their ethical stance.\n"
