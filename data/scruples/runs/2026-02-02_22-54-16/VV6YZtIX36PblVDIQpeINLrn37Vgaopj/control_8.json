      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nSo the author impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago. He didn't want kids and offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted to have the child. They stayed together four months, then broke up. He pays child support through the courts, never missed a payment. He's had no contact with his daughter, only sends a birthday gift anonymously. Now his ex wants him to meet the daughter, he refuses.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the author's lack of involvement beyond financial support. Legally, he's meeting obligations with child support. But emotionally and in terms of the child's well-being, is he in the wrong?\n\nIn many places, legal obligation for child support doesn't require parental involvement. But there's a moral aspect. Children often benefit from having a relationship with both parents. The author is completely disengaged, not even being a part of the child's life. The ex is trying to arrange a meeting, but the author is resistant.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he never wanted children. But once a child is born, there's a responsibility beyond just financial. The child has a right to know their father, even if he didn't want the child. Some might argue the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be involved at all. Others might say it's his right to choose not to be involved, especially if he's fulfilling legal obligations.\n\nBut there's also the impact on the child. The author's stance could affect the daughter's emotional development. However, the ex is the one arranging things, and the author might not be the one initiating contact. Still, not wanting any part in the child's life could be seen as neglecting parental responsibilities beyond just money.\n\nI think the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong). Because while he's meeting legal requirements, he's ignoring the emotional and parental duties. The child deserves a relationship with both parents if possible. The author's refusal to engage, even when approached, suggests a lack of consideration for the child's needs.\n"
