      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a guy who didn't want kids but impregnated his girlfriend. He offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted to keep the baby. They stayed together for a few months, then broke up. He's been paying child support all along, but has had no contact with his daughter. He sends a birthday gift through the ex, but that's it. Now the ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, child support obligations are separate from custody and visitation rights. So even if he's paying child support, that doesn't necessarily mean he has any legal right to be involved in the child's life. But legally, does he have a responsibility to have contact? Maybe not, because the courts might have settled custody with the mother, especially since the father wasn't involved from the start. However, depending on the jurisdiction, the child might have a right to know their father, especially if they're older and want contact.\n\nEthically, it's a different angle. The child is now growing up without a father figure. The author has been providing financially but not emotionally. Some might say he has a responsibility to be part of the child's life, even if he didn't want to be. Others might argue that if he's not interested, he's not wrong for choosing not to engage. But there's also the argument that once you become a parent, you have a responsibility beyond just money; it's about being there for the child's development.\n\nThe author mentions he's never missed a child support payment, which is good, but the emotional aspect is missing. The ex is trying to connect him with the child, which could be for the child's benefit. The author's refusal could prevent the child from having a relationship with her father, which might be important for her well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author never wanted children and has consistently chosen not to be involved, it's possible that forcing him into a relationship could be against his will. However, the child's right to a relationship might outweigh the father's preference. The key here is whether the author is being a responsible parent in all aspects, not just financially.\n\nAlso, the fact that he sends a gift anonymously might indicate some minimal interest, but it's not genuine connection. The ex's attempt to arrange a meeting might be to establish that connection. If the father is avoiding it, some might see it as him abdicating his parental responsibilities beyond financial support.\n\nIn some cultures and legal systems, there's a push for both parents to be involved unless it's detrimental to the child. So the author's refusal could be seen as in the wrong if it's denying the child a potential relationship. However, if the father was not involved from the start, the courts might not enforce contact unless the mother is pressuring for it. Legally, he might not be in the wrong, but ethically, there's a question.\n\nSo the answer hinges on whether the author is required to be involved more than financially. If the law in his area doesn't require it, he might not be in the wrong. But if society or ethics expect more, then he could be seen as wrong. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong, not just legally but morally. The community might have strong opinions here, but the answer depends on the balance between his rights and the child's needs.\n"
