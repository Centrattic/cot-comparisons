I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not wanting to have a part in their child's life. The author impregnated his girlfriend, didn't want kids, offered to pay for an abortion but she chose to have the child. They broke up after four months, and since then, he's paid child support but had no contact. Now the ex wants to arrange a meeting, and he's refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, parents have rights and responsibilities. Even if he didn't want the child, he's a legal parent, so he might have obligations. But he's been paying child support, which is a legal requirement. However, the question is about being in the wrong morally or ethically, not just legally.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might argue that a parent has a duty to be involved in their child's life, regardless of initial intentions. Others might say that if he never wanted a child and the mother wanted to have the child without him, his decision to stay out of the picture is his choice. The key points here are consent, responsibility, and the child's best interest.\n\nThe mother is the one who carried the pregnancy to term and raised the child, so she has primary custody. The father's role here is more about financial support. However, some people might feel that a father should at least have some relationship with the child, even if he's not a part of the daily life. On the other hand, if the child has never known him and he's not interested in building a relationship, it's a different scenario.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the child's well-being. Children generally benefit from having a relationship with both parents, but if the father is not willing or able to be involved, it's not entirely his fault if the mother didn't push for contact. The father's stance is that he's fulfilling his financial obligations but not more. The mother is now seeking contact, but the father is resisting. \n\nI should also consider cultural or societal norms. In some cultures, parental involvement is expected, but in others, if the parent isn't wanted or isn't part of the child's life from the start, it's more accepted. The father's actions might be seen as selfish by some, but others might view it as respecting his autonomy and not forcing him into a role he never wanted.\n\nThe main ethical debate here is between the rights of the parent to refuse involvement versus the child's right to have a relationship with both parents. If the father is not a part of the child's life, is he harming the child? It's a complex issue without a clear right or wrong answer. \n\nIn conclusion, while he's legally compliant by paying child support, morally, some might argue he's neglecting his parental responsibilities. However, others might say he's not in the wrong because he didn't want the child and the mother chose to parent without him. The answer likely depends on perspective and the values one prioritizes.\n"
