      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to be involved in their child's life. Let me break down the details first.\n\nSeven years ago, the author impregnated his girlfriend. He didn't want kids and offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted the child. They stayed together four months post-pregnancy and then broke up. He's been paying child support through the courts and hasn't missed a payment. He's had no contact with his daughter except sending a birthday gift through the ex. Recently, the ex wants to arrange a meeting, but the author refuses and asks not to be contacted again. He's unsure if the daughter or the ex initiated the contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and ethical angles. Legally, in many jurisdictions, parents have both rights and responsibilities. The author is fulfilling the financial responsibility by paying child support, which is a legal obligation. However, there's also the aspect of parental rights, which might include the right to be a parent, but also the right of the child to have a relationship with both parents, unless there are valid reasons to restrict contact (like abuse or danger).\n\nEthically, the author has chosen not to be involved beyond financial support. This might be seen as neglecting the child's need for a relationship with their father. The child has a right to know their father, assuming there's no harm involved. The author is not providing that, which could be considered morally wrong. However, the author might argue that they didn't want to have children and that their ex made the decision to proceed with the pregnancy. But once the child is born, the parent has a responsibility to the child beyond just money.\n\nThe key points here are: the author has no contact, only financial support. The ex is trying to involve the author, but he refuses. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, maybe not, if he's fulfilling all obligations. But ethically, some might say he's wrong to deny the child a relationship. However, if he's not a danger to the child, the law might not force him to be involved. But morally, society often expects parents to be involved in their child's life.\n\nAnother angle: The author's reasons. He never wanted children, so he might feel conflicted. But the child's well-being is a factor. The author's lack of interest could affect the child's emotional development. On the other hand, if he's not a bad person and is providing financially, maybe he's not in the wrong legally. But ethically, some might argue he's wrong to not participate more. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the answer could depend on cultural or personal beliefs about parental responsibility.\n\nIn some places, non-custodial parents are expected to have some level of involvement. If the author is refusing any contact, that could be seen as neglectful. But if the ex is the one pushing for contact, and he's not a danger, then maybe he's not in the wrong. It's a tricky balance between parental rights and child's best interests.\n\nSo, considering all this, legally he's probably not in the wrong since he's meeting financial obligations. Ethically, it's debatable. But the question is from the AITA (Am I the Asshole) perspective, which often leans towards social moral judgment. In such contexts, people might argue that he is neglecting his parental duties beyond finances, which could make him the asshole. However, others might understand his lack of desire for children. The answer hinges on societal expectations versus personal choice.\n"
