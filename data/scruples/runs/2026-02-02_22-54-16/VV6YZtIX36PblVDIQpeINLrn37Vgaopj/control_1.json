I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author impregnated his ex-girlfriend, didn't want kids, offered an abortion but she wanted to keep the child. They broke up, and he's been paying child support but has no contact with his daughter. Now the ex wants to arrange a meeting, and he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, parents have rights regarding their child. Even if the father didn't want the child, once born, he has legal responsibilities, which he's fulfilling with child support. However, visitation rights might be a different matter. Depending on the jurisdiction, parents might have a right to maintain a relationship with their child unless there's a court order preventing it. The father's refusal to have any contact might be affecting the child's well-being, which courts usually prioritize.\n\nEthically, it's a bit more complex. The father didn't want the child and has never engaged with her beyond financial support. While he's legally compliant with payments, emotionally and socially, the child is missing out on a parental relationship. The father's stance is that he never wanted children, but once a child is born, the father has a responsibility beyond just money. The mother might be trying to facilitate a relationship, but the father's refusal could be seen as neglecting his parental role.\n\nBut there's also the argument that the father wasn't prepared for parenthood. However, legal systems often require both parents to be involved unless there's a valid reason (like abuse or endangerment). The father's lack of contact might be legally permissible, but ethically questionable. The question is whether the father is in the wrong for refusing to be part of his daughter's life when he has the means and ability to do so.\n\nAnother angle is the child's best interest. Courts typically decide based on what's best for the child. If the father is capable and the child could benefit from a relationship, the father's refusal might be seen as against the child's best interest. However, if there's a history of conflict or the father isn't fit, that's different. The story doesn't mention any issues like that, just the father's lack of desire.\n\nSo, legally he's not necessarily in the wrong if there's no court order for visitation. But ethically, he might be. The question is whether the user considers legal vs. moral wrong. Since the prompt asks if the author is in the wrong, the answer depends on the perspective. In many cases, people might say the father is in the wrong for not wanting to be involved despite the child's needs. So answer A (yes) might be more likely.\n"
