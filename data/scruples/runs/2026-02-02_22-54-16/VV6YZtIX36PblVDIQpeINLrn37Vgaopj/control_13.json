I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a child, the author's ex-girlfriend, and their daughter. The author didn't want kids, offered to pay for an abortion but she wanted to keep the child. They broke up after four months, and since then, the author has been paying child support but not involved in the child's life. Recently, the ex wants the author to meet the daughter, but he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, child support is mandatory, and the father has legal rights to see the child unless there's a restriction. However, the author has been paying support but not seeking visitation. So legally, maybe the ex has the right to facilitate contact, especially if the child is asking about the father. But the author is refusing.\n\nEthically, this is tricky. The father didn't want children, but once the child was born, he's financially responsible. Some might argue that the child has a right to know their father, especially if they're old enough to be curious. The author's lack of involvement could be seen as neglecting a parental responsibility beyond just financial. On the other hand, if the father has no interest and the mother is respecting that by not forcing contact, maybe it's his right to not want to be involved. However, if the child is interested in meeting him, the father's refusal might prevent the child from having a relationship they desire.\n\nAlso, the author mentions sending birthday gifts, which shows some level of acknowledgment. But cutting off all contact might be seen as avoiding a relationship. The key points here are the child's welfare, the father's rights and responsibilities, and the mother's role in facilitating contact. The answer might depend on cultural and legal norms, but generally, there's a social expectation for parents to have some relationship with their child, even if not involved in daily care. So the author might be in the wrong for refusing contact if the child is interested. But if the author has legitimate reasons (like not wanting to be involved) and the mother is okay with that, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, he might not be, but ethically, there's a strong case against him.\n"
