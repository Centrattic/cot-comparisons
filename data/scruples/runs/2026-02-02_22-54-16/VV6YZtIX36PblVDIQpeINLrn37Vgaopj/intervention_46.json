I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe user is a man who got his girlfriend pregnant seven years ago. He didn't want kids and offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted to have the child. They stayed together for four months, then broke up. He agreed to pay child support through the courts and has never missed a payment. He hasn't had contact with his daughter, only sending a birthday gift through the ex. Now the ex wants him to meet his daughter, but he's not interested and asked her not to contact him again. He's unsure if the ex or the daughter initiated the request.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, legal obligations. He's fulfilling his financial responsibilities, so legally he's probably okay. But what about parental rights and responsibilities? In many places, parents have a legal obligation not just financially but to maintain contact if possible, unless there's a court order restricting it. However, since he hasn't been involved, maybe the ex has custody and is managing the child's life.\n\nEmotionally, the child might benefit from having a relationship with both parents, but the father has made it clear he doesn't want any part in the child's life. The mother is trying to connect him, but he's refusing. This could be seen as neglecting his parental duties beyond financial support. However, if there was a court agreement or if the mother has sole custody, he might have limited rights. But if he hasn't had contact since the child was born, maybe there's a case for him to have been neglectful.\n\nAnother angle: the father didn't want children and the child isn't his biologically? No, he impregnated his girlfriend, so the child is his. So he has a parental responsibility. But he's only providing financial support, not emotional or physical involvement. In many jurisdictions, parents are expected to maintain some level of contact unless there's a valid reason (like abuse, etc.). If he's avoiding contact, that could be considered neglecting his parental responsibilities.\n\nBut maybe the mother has sole custody, so the father's rights are limited. However, typically, even with sole custody, the parent is supposed to have visitation rights unless there's a court order preventing it. If he hasn't been involved, the court might consider his lack of contact as having voluntarily given up his rights, but that's a legal matter.\n\nMorally, it's a different story. The father is providing money but not being present. The child might want to know him, and the mother is trying to facilitate that. From a moral standpoint, refusing contact could be seen as selfish or neglectful. However, the father himself didn't want to be a parent. There's a conflict between his personal desires and the child's needs.\n\nIs there a reason he can't meet the child? The story doesn't mention any issues like abuse, coercion, or other problems. He just doesn't want to be involved. That could be seen as not taking his parental responsibilities seriously.\n\nBut maybe he's not in the wrong because he was honest from the start. He didn't want kids, tried to avoid it, and is fulfilling the legal obligations he has. However, once a child is born, parental responsibilities extend beyond money. So legally and morally, there might be an obligation to be involved.\n\nBut in some places, if a parent hasn't been involved and the child is now older, the court might not force contact if it's against the parent's wishes. However, the mother is trying to arrange it, so maybe the father's refusal is against the child's best interests.\n\nIn summary, legally, he's meeting the financial part. Morally, he's avoiding emotional and physical involvement. Depending on local laws, he might have a case where he's not in the wrong if his rights were already determined. But generally, parents are expected to maintain contact. So maybe he is in the wrong for not taking on the full parental responsibilities beyond just money.\n"
