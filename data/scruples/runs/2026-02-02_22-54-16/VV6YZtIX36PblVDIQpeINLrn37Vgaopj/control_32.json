I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author had a child with his girlfriend 7 years ago. He didn't want kids and offered her an abortion, but she wanted the baby. They stayed together for a few months and then broke up. Since then, he's been paying child support but has no contact with his daughter. He sends a birthday gift through the ex with instructions not to reveal it's from him. Now, the ex wants to arrange a meeting between the author and the daughter, but the author refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, parents have legal rights and responsibilities toward their children, including the right to maintain a relationship unless there's a court order preventing contact. The author is paying child support, which is a legal obligation, but not having contact might be different. If there's no court order that restricts his contact, maybe he can choose not to be involved. However, if the ex is seeking to establish or increase contact, the author's refusal might require a legal justification. \n\nThen there's the ethical angle. Even if he's legally allowed to refuse contact, is it morally right? Some people believe that children have a right to know both parents, especially if both are fit and willing. The author isn't showing any interest in his daughter's life beyond financial support. The ex might be trying to honor the daughter's wishes or her own feelings. The author's stance could be seen as selfish or neglectful, harming the child's emotional well-being. \n\nBut the author argues he never wanted kids and isn't interested. Some might say he should have thought about consequences before having a child. On the other hand, if the ex is the one pushing for contact without the daughter's input, maybe the author's refusal is justified if he doesn't want to be involved. However, the daughter's age is a factor. If she's old enough to express a desire to meet her father, the author's refusal could be more problematic.\n\nAlso, the way he sends gifts anonymously might be confusing for the child. The author's actions could lead the daughter to feel confused or deprived of a relationship. Legally, in some jurisdictions, a non-custodial parent can refuse contact if there's a legitimate reason, but without a court order, it's a gray area. \n\nIn summary, while the author is fulfilling his financial obligations, the ethical and emotional impact on the daughter is significant. The author's lack of interest in a relationship might be seen as neglecting his parental responsibilities beyond just money. So, depending on cultural or legal standards, he might be in the wrong. But if there's no legal requirement for contact, maybe not. However, morally, many would argue that a parent has a duty to engage with their child. So the answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong) due to ethical considerations, even if legally he's not bound.\n"
