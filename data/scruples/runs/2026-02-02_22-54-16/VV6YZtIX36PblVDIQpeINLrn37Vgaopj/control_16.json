      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting any part in their child's life.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The person impregnated their girlfriend seven years ago. They didn't want kids and offered an abortion, but she went ahead with the pregnancy. They were together four months after and then broke up. They settled child support through the courts and he's paid every time. No contact with the daughter, only a birthday gift sent via the mother. Now the ex wants them to meet the daughter, but the person is refusing.\n\nSo, the key points here are: legal responsibility (child support) vs. parental rights and responsibilities. Legally, he's paying support, which is required by law. But what about the actual parental relationship? The child has a right to know their father, but the person doesn't want to be involved. \n\nIs it wrong to not want to be a parent? Well, in terms of legal responsibilities, he's fulfilling the financial part. But emotionally and morally, there's a debate here. Some might argue that a parent has a duty beyond just money; they should be present in the child's life. Others might say that if he didn't want children, he's not in the wrong for upholding his decision, especially since the other parent (his ex) is the primary caregiver.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's sending a birthday gift shows some level of acknowledgment, even if minimal. But refusing to meet the child might be problematic. The child's well-being is important, and having a relationship with both parents can be beneficial. However, if the parent is not interested, forcing them to be involved could be against their autonomy.\n\nLegally, he's meeting his obligations. Ethically, it's a bit more complex. The question is whether not being involved is wrong. Some might say it is because a parent's role isn't just about money but also about being present. Others might argue that it's not his fault if he didn't want to be a parent in the first place, especially after the other parent chose to continue the pregnancy.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, there might be laws requiring parental contact, but in many places, if the parent is paying support and the other parent is willing to let them off the hook, maybe there's no legal issue. But morally, it's a gray area. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer isn't straightforward. The person isn't legally in the wrong, but there's an ethical argument either way. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If we go by legal standards, no. If social norms, maybe yes. The answer likely leans towards A (they are in the wrong) because of the child's right to a relationship, but others might say B (not wrong) based on personal choice. But I need to pick one. Given that the author has no contact and refuses to meet, which could harm the child, the answer might be A. But I should check if the law requires contact. If not, then it's B. However, many people would say it's wrong regardless of the law. So, I'm a bit torn but leaning towards A because the parent is not fulfilling any emotional part, just the financial. So, AITA is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the answer is A.\n"
