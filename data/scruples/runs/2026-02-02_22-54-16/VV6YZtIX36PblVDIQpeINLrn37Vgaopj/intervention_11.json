I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a father who didn't want to have a child, and after the breakup, has been providing child support but has no contact with his daughter. Now the ex wants him to meet the child, but he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, fathers have legal obligations to provide child support even if they choose not to be involved. So legally, he's fulfilling his duties. But there's the ethical side. Does a parent have a moral obligation to be involved in their child's life? Some would argue yes, that children benefit from having a relationship with both parents. Others might say that if the parent never wanted children, forcing them to be involved could be against their autonomy.\n\nThe author mentions sending a birthday gift through the ex. That's a minimal level of contact. He's not engaging further. The ex is trying to set up a meeting, but he's not interested. He's clear about his stance. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to be part of his daughter's life.\n\nLegally, he's not in the wrong. Child support is his responsibility, and he's meeting it. Ethically, it's more complex. Some might say he's being selfish by not giving his child a relationship with her father. Others might argue that he has the right to make that choice, especially since he didn't want children in the first place. However, the child has the right to know both parents, but the father's right to autonomy is also a factor.\n\nThe user is leaning towards the author not being in the wrong, and I can see that perspective. But there's a societal expectation that parents should be involved. However, if the father is fulfilling his financial obligations and isn't causing harm, maybe he's not the asshole. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. In this case, the author isn't violating the law, so the answer is more likely B.\n"
