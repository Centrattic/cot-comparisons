I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a man who didn't want children but got his girlfriend pregnant. He offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted the child. They broke up after four months, and he's been paying child support without any contact. Now the ex wants him to meet their daughter, and he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. He's been paying child support, which is a legal obligation. He hasn't missed payments, so he's fulfilling that duty. However, child support and visitation rights are separate. Legally, in many jurisdictions, the non-custodial parent does have the right to visitation unless a court orders otherwise. But in this case, he's never taken part in the child's life beyond financial support. So maybe legally, he could be obligated to have some contact, but the court might not have mandated it unless the ex requested it.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author doesn't want any part in the child's life. Some people argue that having biological children comes with a responsibility to be involved. Others might say that if both parties agreed to not have a relationship, then it's different. However, the ex might feel that the child deserves to know the father, even if he doesn't want it. The author is sending birthday gifts anonymously, which could be seen as a minimal effort, but not a real relationship.\n\nThe key points here are consent and responsibility. The author didn't want the child but allowed the pregnancy. Now he's avoiding any contact. Legally, he's meeting his financial obligations, but ethically, some might say he has a duty to be a parent. Others might argue that since he didn't want the child and the ex wanted to proceed, his rights are limited. However, the child has a right to know both parents if possible.\n\nThe author's stance is that he never wanted the child, so he's not in the wrong. But many people might feel that once a child is born, the parent has responsibilities beyond just money. So, depending on societal norms and personal ethics, opinions could vary. Some might side with him because he's fulfilling his legal obligations, while others might think he's neglecting his parental duties. The answer depends on whether one prioritizes legal compliance over ethical parental involvement.\n"
