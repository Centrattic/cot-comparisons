I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who never wanted children, impregnated his girlfriend, offered an abortion which she declined, then broke up. He's been paying child support but has no contact with his daughter. Now his ex wants to arrange a meeting, and he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, parents have legal rights and responsibilities towards their children. Even if you don't want to be involved, you can't necessarily block all contact if the child's well-being is a consideration. The father is paying child support, which covers basic needs, but emotional and parental involvement is another aspect. \n\nThen, there's the ethical angle. While legal obligations might be met, ethical standards often emphasize a child's right to know both parents, unless there's harm involved. The father is cutting out all contact, which might affect the child's development. However, the father's personal stance is that he never wanted children, so his feelings are genuine. \n\nBut the ex is trying to arrange a meeting. The father's refusal could be seen as selfish if the child wants to know him. Also, the mother might have a role here in facilitating contact, but the father's stance is to avoid it entirely. \n\nPossible counterarguments: The father is fulfilling financial duties, so maybe he's not legally in the wrong. But ethically, he might be neglecting his parental responsibilities beyond money. Also, the child's age is a factor. If the daughter is old enough to want to meet, denying that could be harmful. \n\nThe father's actions could be considered wrong because he's avoiding all parental involvement beyond financial. Even if he's not the primary caregiver, a complete lack of contact might not be in the child's best interest. However, if there's a valid reason, like abuse or instability, that's different. The scenario doesn't mention any such issues. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because while he's met legal obligations, he's neglected his parental role, which impacts the child's emotional well-being. But if the law allows him to disengage, maybe not. But ethically, it's still a problem. The answer likely leans towards A.\n"
