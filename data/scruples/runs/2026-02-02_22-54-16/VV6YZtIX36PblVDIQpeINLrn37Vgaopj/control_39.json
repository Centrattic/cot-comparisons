I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is they impregnated their girlfriend seven years ago, didn't want kids, offered an abortion but she wanted the child. They stayed together four months, then broke up. The author has been paying child support but has had no contact with their daughter, only sending a birthday gift through the mother. Now the ex wants them to meet the daughter, but the author refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, parents have legal rights and responsibilities regarding their children. Even if the author didn't want the child, once the child is born, they have a legal duty to provide support, which they're doing. But what about visitation rights? Depending on the jurisdiction, if the parent hasn't been involved, courts might still consider the child's best interest in having a relationship with both parents. So legally, maybe the author could be required to have contact if the court deems it necessary.\n\nEthically, this is more complex. The author is fulfilling their financial obligation but not engaging in any emotional or parental role. Some might argue that the child has a right to know their parent, while others might say the author was never interested and shouldn't be forced. However, completely cutting off contact might be seen as neglecting the child's emotional needs.\n\nThe author's refusal to meet the child could be causing harm. Children often benefit from having both parents in their lives, even if the parents aren't in a relationship. The author's stance might be selfish, avoiding responsibility without considering the child's welfare. However, some might argue that if the parent is not capable of being involved, it's better for the child to have a stable life with the mother rather than an inconsistent or forced relationship.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's initial decision. They didn't want children and offered an abortion, which shows they didn't take responsibility for the pregnancy. Now, after seven years, avoiding any contact could be seen as avoiding parental duties beyond just financial ones. Courts might prioritize the child's interest in having a relationship with both parents, so the author's refusal could be legally problematic.\n\nIn summary, while the author isn't neglecting financially, they're neglecting the parental relationship, which is a significant part of being a parent. The legal system typically supports the child's right to a relationship with both parents unless it's harmful. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong both morally and legally.\n"
