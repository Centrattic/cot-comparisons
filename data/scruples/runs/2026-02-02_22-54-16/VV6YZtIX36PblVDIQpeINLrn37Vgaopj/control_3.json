I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be part of their child's life. The situation is that the author impregnated his girlfriend, didn't want kids, offered an abortion, but she went ahead with the pregnancy. They split up after four months. He's paid child support every time but has had no contact, only sending a birthday gift through the mother. Now the ex wants him to meet the daughter, and he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, parents have legal rights and responsibilities regarding their children. Even if the father didn't want the child, once the child is born, he's a legal parent. So cutting off contact completely might be legally questionable. Some jurisdictions require reasonable contact unless it's in the child's best interest to limit it. But the father here is only sending a gift, which is minimal contact.\n\nEthically, it's more complicated. The father didn't want the child but accepted responsibility by paying child support. However, not having any relationship beyond financial support might be seen as neglecting the child's emotional needs. The mother might have the right to enforce some contact if it's in the child's best interest. On the other hand, the father might argue that he wasn't prepared for parenthood and that his non-involvement was a conscious choice.\n\nThe mother's request for a meeting might be for the child's sake. As the child grows, she might want to know her father. The father's refusal could be seen as prioritizing his own feelings over the child's right to a relationship with both parents. However, if the father has valid reasons like not being a suitable parent, then maybe there's a case for his stance. But the question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether there are mitigating factors.\n\nIn many family law systems, the child's best interest is paramount. If the father is unwilling to participate in any meaningful way, the court might consider whether it's in the child's interest to have that relationship. But if the father is refusing contact despite being a legal parent, that could be seen as denying the child's rights.\n\nSo, legally, he might be in the wrong because he's refusing contact without a valid reason. Ethically, it's a gray area, but the lack of any contact beyond financial support might be considered insufficient. Therefore, the answer might lean towards Yes (A) because he's not fulfilling parental responsibilities beyond financial support, which is generally expected.\n"
