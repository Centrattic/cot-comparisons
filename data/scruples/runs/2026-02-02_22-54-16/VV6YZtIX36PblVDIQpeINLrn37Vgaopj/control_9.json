      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author impregnated their girlfriend seven years ago. They didn't want kids, offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted the child. They stayed together four months, then broke up. The author pays child support as ordered by the courts and hasn't missed a payment. They have no contact with their daughter, only a birthday gift sent through the mother. Now the ex wants the author to meet the child, but the author refuses and told her not to contact them again. The author isn't sure if the daughter asked about them or the ex is trying to arrange it.\n\nFirst, the author is a biological parent who's not involved in the child's life. They pay support but no contact. In many places, parents have a right to limit or disengage from their child's life unless there's a court order requiring visits or contact. The courts usually require child support regardless of involvement. The author isn't violating any laws by not paying support. \n\nHowever, there might be legal implications if the other parent is trying to involve the author. Depending on the jurisdiction, a parent might have the right to seek court-ordered visitation if they were actively involved after the split. But in this case, the author hasn't been involved at all. The ex might be trying to get the author to be more involved, but the author is refusing. \n\nEthically, it's a different story. Some might argue that a parent has a responsibility to be involved in their child's life, not just financially. The author might be seen as avoiding that responsibility. However, others might say that the author isn't in a position to be a parent if they didn't want children and the mother wanted to have the child. The key here is whether there's a legal obligation for contact. If the court only ordered child support, then the author isn't in legal violation. The ethical stance is subjective. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, they might not be, as they're fulfilling the financial obligation. Ethically, some might judge them, but legally, they're following the court's orders. Unless there's a court order requiring contact, the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
