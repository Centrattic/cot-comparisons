I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author impregnated his ex-girlfriend, didn't want kids, offered an abortion but she went through with the pregnancy. They broke up after four months, he's paid child support consistently but had no contact. Now his ex wants him to meet their daughter, but he's refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, he's doing his part with child support, which is important for the child's well-being. But does he have any legal obligation to be involved? In many places, child support and visitation are separate. He might not be legally required to have contact, but there's an ethical angle here. The child has a right to know her father, especially if it's in her best interest. However, the author has never wanted children, so maybe his lack of interest is genuine. But by not being involved, he's denying the child a relationship with a parent. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but others might argue that even if he didn't want kids, once a child exists, he has a responsibility beyond just financial support. The ex is trying to arrange contact, but maybe the author is avoiding it. Some might say that the child deserves to have both parents in her life if possible, unless there's a valid reason to avoid it (like abuse or neglect), which isn't mentioned here. The author's only interaction is sending a gift anonymously, which is minimal. \n\nSo, the key points are: legal obligations met, but ethical responsibility to the child might require more involvement. The author's refusal to engage could be seen as selfish, but his lack of desire for children is a personal choice. However, the child's right to a relationship with both parents is a strong argument. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A), but I need to check if there's a cultural or legal context I'm missing. In many jurisdictions, fathers do have responsibilities beyond money, but enforcement varies. Since the author isn't facing legal consequences yet, but ethically, he's avoiding a parental role beyond financial support. Hence, the answer is likely A.\n"
