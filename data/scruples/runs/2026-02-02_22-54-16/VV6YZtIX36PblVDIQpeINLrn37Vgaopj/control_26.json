I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago, didn't want kids, offered to pay for an abortion, but she decided to keep the child. They stayed together for four months, then broke up. He's been paying child support consistently but has had no contact with his daughter, only sending a birthday gift through the ex. Now the ex wants him to meet the daughter, which he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal obligations. In many places, child support is a legal requirement, and the father has obligations regardless of the relationship. But does he have a legal right to be involved in the child's life? Or is it up to the mother? Some jurisdictions might require both parents to have a relationship with the child if it's in the child's best interest. So if he's been absent, maybe there's a legal aspect where he should be involved.\n\nEthically, it's more complex. The father didn't want children and wasn't involved after the breakup. He pays support but no contact. The ex is now trying to reconnect him. The question is whether it's morally wrong to refuse contact when the child is growing up. The father might argue that he's fulfilling his financial duties, but the child deserves to know her father. On the other hand, the father might feel that his personal choice not to have kids should be respected.\n\nAnother angle: the child's well-being. Many people would say that a child benefits from a relationship with both parents, even if the parents are no longer together. The father's refusal might be seen as selfish because the child could miss out on a parental relationship. However, if the father isn't emotionally prepared or doesn't want to be involved, is that his right? Or does becoming a parent impose a responsibility regardless of initial desires?\n\nAlso, the fact that he only sends a gift once a year might not be enough for the child's emotional needs. The ex's initiative to connect could be in the child's best interest. The father's refusal might be perceived as avoiding responsibility, even if he's paying financially.\n\nBut then, the father's stance is that he didn't want children and has honored the child support. The law might require him to pay, but not to be involved. However, in some places, parental rights might require some level of involvement. If the ex is seeking court-mandated contact, the father's refusal could lead to legal issues.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, there's often pressure on parents to be involved in their children's lives, even if they're not in a relationship. The father's absence could be seen as neglectful, especially if the child is now old enough to ask about him.\n\nIn conclusion, while he's fulfilling the financial part, the emotional and parental involvement is another matter. Depending on the legal framework and societal norms, the father could be considered wrong for refusing contact with his child, even if he didn't want children initially. So the answer might lean towards A (yes, he's in the wrong) because the child has a right to a relationship with both parents, and his refusal could harm the child's well-being.\n"
