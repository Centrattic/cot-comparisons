I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a person who had a child with their ex, but never wanted kids. They didn't want to get an abortion, so the ex had the child. They broke up after 4 months, and the author has been paying child support but has had no contact otherwise. Now the ex wants the author to meet their daughter, but the author isn't interested and asked to stop contacting them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical angles. Legally, in many places, parents have a duty to be involved in their child's life, even if they're not in a relationship. However, if there's a court order that allows the mother to have primary custody and the father isn't required to have contact, maybe the author isn't breaking the law. But it's more about ethical responsibility here.\n\nThe author is paying child support, so they're fulfilling the financial part. But emotionally and psychologically, the child might benefit from a relationship with both parents, assuming it's safe. The author doesn't want any part in the child's life, which could be seen as selfish. The child has a right to know their father, even if the father never wanted kids. But if the author is happy with their choice and isn't harming the child, maybe it's their right to make that decision.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the mother arranging the meeting. If the author is not interested, pushing for contact could be stressful for the mother and the child. However, the author's refusal to engage might be considered neglectful. It's a balance between personal choice and parental responsibility.\n\nIn some cultures, the father's role is expected, but in others, it's more flexible. The key points are: the author didn't want children, took financial responsibility, but no contact. The ex is trying to include the father, but the author is steadfast. The question is whether the author's stance is wrong.\n\nI think there's a difference between right and wrong here. Legally, maybe there's a case if the court requires contact, but if not, the author's decision might be legal. Ethically, it's more complex. The author is avoiding all contact, which could be harmful in the long run for the child. But the author is not forcing contact, just not engaging. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. Maybe they're not in the wrong legally, but ethically, there's an argument that they're not fulfilling their parental role. However, the decision to not have children was made before the child was born, so maybe they're not at fault. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but I'm not entirely sure. Some might say they have a responsibility, but others might say it's their right to choose.\n"
