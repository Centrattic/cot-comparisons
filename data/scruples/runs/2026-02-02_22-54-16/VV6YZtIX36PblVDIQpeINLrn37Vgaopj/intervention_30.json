I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author impregnating his girlfriend seven years ago, not wanting children, and paying child support without seeking contact. Now, the ex wants to arrange a meeting, and the author refuses.\n\nFirst, the key points: He didn't want kids, offered to pay for an abortion, she wanted to have the child. They broke up after four months. He pays court-ordered child support without fail, no contact, only sends gifts anonymously. The ex contacts him about meeting the daughter, he refuses.\n\nLegal responsibility is clear\u2014he's meeting child support obligations, so legally, he's doing what's required. But the question is about moral or ethical wrongdoing. The author hasn't wanted any contact, which might be seen as neglectful by some. However, others might argue that he's not the custodial parent and has no legal obligation to be involved beyond support. \n\nThe mother has custody, so she's the one making decisions about the child's upbringing and relationships. If she's trying to set up a meeting, maybe she's acting in the child's best interest. But the author's stance is that he doesn't want to be involved. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, some might say he has a responsibility to be part of his child's life, especially as a father. Others might say that if he never wanted children and the mother chose to have the child, it's her decision to raise the child without him, and he's fulfilling his financial duty. \n\nBut there's a potential harm in the child growing up without a father figure. However, the author hasn't actively harmed the child; he's just not involved. The mother could be the one influencing the child's desire to meet him. The author's refusal to engage could be seen as dismissive, but without being a parent, it's hard to judge. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, being a father is often expected to be involved. But this is a personal choice, and if the mother is adequately providing, maybe it's her responsibility. The author's actions don't seem malicious; he's just choosing not to participate. However, the fact that he sends a gift anonymously might be a way to have some connection, but he still refuses any direct contact. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's meeting his legal obligations and the mother has custody. But there's a moral argument that he should try to be involved. However, since he's not the custodial parent and the mother is handling the child's upbringing, his refusal might not make him the asshole. The mother's actions might be the issue if she's pushing for contact against his wishes, but the author is within his rights to refuse.\n"
