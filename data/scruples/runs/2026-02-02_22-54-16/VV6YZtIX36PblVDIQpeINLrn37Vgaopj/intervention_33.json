I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The author impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago, didn't want kids, offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted the child. They stayed together four months after the pregnancy confirmation, then broke up. He's been paying child support through the courts and never missed a payment. He hasn't had contact with the daughter, only sent gifts on her birthday via the mother. Then the ex wants him to meet the daughter, and he refuses, asking her not to contact him again.\n\nFirst, the author's stance is clear: he doesn't want any part in his child's life. He's fulfilling his financial responsibility but not emotional or parental. The question is whether this makes him in the wrong. \n\nLegally, he's doing what's required by paying child support. So he's not breaking any laws. But morally and ethically, it's a different story. The child has a right to know her father, even if the father doesn't want to be involved. The mother might be trying to give the child that connection. The author is cutting off all contact, which could be harmful to the child in the long run. \n\nThe author argues he never wanted children and isn't interested. But once a child is born, parental responsibility isn't just financial. It's about the child's well-being too. The author's refusal to engage could be seen as neglecting the child's emotional needs. Even if he's not the one initiating contact, the ex is trying to create a relationship, and he's blocking that. \n\nSo while he's not breaking any laws, morally, he's denying his child the chance to know her father. That's where the conflict lies. The community might argue that the child's best interest is to have a relationship with both parents, even if the father isn't eager. The author's stance could be seen as selfish, prioritizing his own desires over the child's potential needs. \n\nBut some might side with the author, saying he was never ready for parenthood and it's not fair to force him to be a parent against his will. However, once a child is born, the responsibility isn't optional. The father's role isn't just about wanting to be a parent but about meeting the child's needs. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in legal wrong, but ethically, he might be in the wrong by refusing any involvement beyond financial support, potentially harming the child's emotional development.\n"
