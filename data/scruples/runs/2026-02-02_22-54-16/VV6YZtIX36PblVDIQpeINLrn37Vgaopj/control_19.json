I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be involved in their child's life. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person got their girlfriend pregnant seven years ago. They didn't want kids, offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted to keep the child. They stayed together four months, then broke up. The author pays child support and has never had contact, only a birthday gift sent through the mother. Recently, the ex wants the author to meet the daughter, but the author refuses and asks not to be contacted again.\n\nSo the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, they've been paying child support, which is their responsibility. But morally? Well, kids have a right to know their parents, but the author hasn't been involved at all. However, they were clear from the start that they didn't want kids. The ex might be trying to get more contact, but the author's stance is to stay out of it.\n\nLegal obligations don't necessarily equate to moral ones. The author is fulfilling the financial part but not the emotional or personal involvement. Some people might say that a child has the right to a relationship with both parents, unless there's abuse or something. The author hasn't provided any such issues, just a lack of desire to be involved. \n\nBut others might argue that by fathering a child, there's a responsibility beyond just money. The author sent a gift once, which is a small gesture, but no real relationship. Maybe the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be part of the child's life at all. However, it's also important to consider their initial stance\u2014never wanting kids. They had the chance to prevent the pregnancy but didn't. Now they're facing the consequences.\n\nThere's a middle ground. The author isn't abusive or neglectful in terms of money, but emotionally, they're absent. Society often expects parents to be involved beyond just financial support. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not wanting any contact at all, even if they were against having kids initially. But it's a tricky situation. They might not be in the wrong legally, but ethically, it's debatable.\n"
