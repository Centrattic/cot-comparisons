I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who didn't want children, impregnated his girlfriend, offered an abortion which she declined, they broke up after four months. He's been paying child support but has no contact with his daughter. Now his ex wants him to meet the child, and he refuses.\n\nFirst, laws on child custody and parental rights vary by location. In many places, once a child is born, both parents have legal rights and responsibilities. Even if he didn't want the child, once he accepted paternity and agreed to child support, he might have legal obligations to be involved. Denying contact could lead to legal consequences. \n\nEmotionally, the child's well-being is a factor. Having both parents involved can be beneficial, unless there are valid reasons (like abuse or neglect) not to. The father here hasn't provided any such reasons. He's only mentioned a lack of interest. The child might have a right to know her father, even if he's not a primary caregiver. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might argue that a parent has a duty to be involved, regardless of their initial wishes. Others might say that if a person doesn't want children, they shouldn't put the other parent in a position where they have to seek contact. But once a child exists, the parent has a responsibility. \n\nThe father is paying support but avoiding contact. That's fulfilling a financial obligation but not an emotional one. The mother is trying to connect him, which might be in the child's best interest. Refusing contact could be seen as selfish or neglectful. \n\nHowever, if he's not in the child's life by choice, maybe he's not the wrongdoer, but he's certainly not fulfilling his role. The answer might depend on legal rights versus moral responsibilities. Legally, he might be in the wrong if he's denying contact without a valid reason. Morally, it's a gray area but leaning towards him being in the wrong for not engaging with his child. \n\nSo the answer is likely A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's not fulfilling his parental role despite having legal responsibilities. But I need to be sure about the legal aspects. In many jurisdictions, fathers can't just opt out of contact once paternity is established. If he's been blocking contact, he could face legal issues. So yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
