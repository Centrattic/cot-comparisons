I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that they got their girlfriend pregnant seven years ago, didn't want kids, offered an abortion, but she wanted to keep the baby. They stayed together a bit, then broke up. The guy pays child support but has no contact, only sending birthday gifts through the mother. Now the ex wants him to meet their daughter, but he refuses.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are the legal part of child support vs. parental rights. He's paying money, which is a legal obligation, but isn't involved in the child's life. Legally, in many places, a parent has the right to have contact with their child, but if there's a custody arrangement, maybe the mother is the primary caregiver. However, if the father is not involved, does he still have that right?\n\nAlso, the ethical aspect. The child might have a right to know their father, even if the father didn't want kids. But the father might feel that he doesn't want to be part of the child's life. Is it wrong to deny the child a relationship when he's financially supporting them? Or does the lack of involvement negate his responsibility beyond money?\n\nLaws vary by country. In some places, once you're a parent, you have responsibilities that include visitation, not just support. If the court ordered him to pay support, maybe they also set up some form of contact. If he's not complying with any court-ordered contact, then he might be in the wrong. But if there's no such order, maybe he's not. Also, if the mother is blocking contact, that's different from the father refusing.\n\nThe father is being asked by the mother to meet the child. He's declining. If the mother is trying to facilitate contact but he's blocking it, that might be problematic. The father's argument is that he doesn't want to be part of the child's life. But from an ethical standpoint, the child has a right to know their parent, especially if they're asking. The father's lack of involvement beyond financial support could be seen as neglecting his parental duties beyond support.\n\nBut in some jurisdictions, a parent can disengage by not seeking custody or visitation rights if the other parent is the primary caregiver. However, if the other parent wants the child to have a relationship with the other parent, the non-custodial parent might still have obligations. So if the mother is trying to arrange contact, the father's refusal might be legally and ethically questionable. If there's no court order for contact, maybe he's not in the wrong legally, but ethically, it's a gray area. However, the question is about being in the wrong in general, not just legally. So the answer might be A (yes he's in the wrong) if we consider ethical and parental responsibilities beyond just financial support.\n"
