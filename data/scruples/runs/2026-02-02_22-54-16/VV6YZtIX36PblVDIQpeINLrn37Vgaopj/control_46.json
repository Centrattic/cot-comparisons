I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe person (the author) impregnated their girlfriend seven years ago. They didn't want kids, offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted to have the child. They stayed together four months, then broke up. The author has been paying child support all along, never missed a payment. They've had no contact with their daughter, only sending a birthday gift through the mother. Now the ex wants the author to meet the daughter, but the author refuses and asks not to be contacted again. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, child support is a legal obligation, and the author is fulfilling that. However, parental rights might include visitation rights. If the author has never had contact, maybe there's a legal process to establish or deny visitation. But the author hasn't pursued that, just refused when approached.\n\nEthically, this is more complex. The author initially didn't want the child and is now choosing not to have any relationship. The child has a right to know their father, but the author's stance is that they never wanted children. The mother's role is to facilitate contact, but the author is blocking that. However, the author has been financially responsible.\n\nPossible arguments against the author: They have a legal obligation to support the child but may have a legal right to refuse contact. However, some jurisdictions might require reasonable contact unless a court decides otherwise. Also, the child's interest in having a relationship with the father could be a factor.\n\nArguments for the author: They never wanted to be a parent, have been responsible with support, and the mother initiated the contact after the breakup. The author might feel that being forced into a relationship is unfair, especially if they didn't consent to the pregnancy beyond financial support.\n\nPotential consequences: If the ex takes legal action, the court might order visitation, considering the child's best interests. But the author's consistent refusal could lead to legal repercussions if they don't comply.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether fulfilling financial obligations alone is sufficient. Legally, maybe not, as parental rights might include visitation. Ethically, it's a tough call. The author's stance is against their wishes, but the child's right to know their parent is also important.\n\nConsidering all angles, the author might be in the wrong legally if visitation is required, but the answer depends on local laws. Since the question is about being in the wrong, and the user is asking for a yes/no answer, the answer might lean towards Yes (A) because the author is refusing contact despite the child's right to a relationship. However, some might argue No (B) because they're fulfilling their support duties. The final answer would depend on balancing these factors.\n"
