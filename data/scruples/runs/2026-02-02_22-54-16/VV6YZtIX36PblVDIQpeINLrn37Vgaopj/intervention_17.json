      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago. He didn't want kids and offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted to have the child. They stayed together for four months, then broke up. He pays child support through the courts and never missed a payment. He's had no contact with the daughter, only sending birthday gifts through the mother. Recently, the ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he's not interested and asked not to be contacted about it again. He's not sure if the daughter is asking or the ex is trying to set it up.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know my opinion. The answer should be A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nSo, breaking it down. The main points are: he didn't want kids, she did. They broke up, he pays support but no contact. Now the ex wants to arrange a meeting, but he refuses. \n\nFirst, legal aspect: He's paying child support, which is a legal obligation. So he's fulfilling that. But in many jurisdictions, fathers have the right to be involved, unless there's a court order restricting that. But here, there's no mention of any court order preventing contact. So maybe the mother could be blocking him from having contact, but he's not doing that\u2014he's just not initiating contact. However, if the mother wants to arrange a meeting, and he refuses, does he have a responsibility to at least consider it?\n\nMoral aspect: He's the father. Even if he doesn't want to be a parent, the child might have a right to know him. But he's paying support, which is a duty. Some people might argue that being a parent isn't just about financial support but also emotional involvement. However, if the father is not the one blocking contact and is not involved by choice, maybe it's his right to not be involved. \n\nBut there's a difference between not being involved and actively refusing to engage. If the mother is trying to facilitate contact, and he's refusing, is that wrong? Especially if the child is old enough to be curious about him. The author says he's not interested in a relationship, but maybe the child deserves the choice. However, the author is not the one preventing contact; the mother is trying to arrange it, and he's declining.\n\nIn some cases, if a parent refuses contact and the other parent is trying to facilitate it, there might be legal implications. But if it's not in the court order, he might not be in the wrong. The key is whether he's violating any court orders. Since he's never had contact and the mother hasn't gone to court to force it, maybe he's within his rights. \n\nBut ethically, some might say that as a parent, he has a responsibility beyond just financial support. However, if he never wanted children and has been consistent in not being involved, perhaps that's his choice. The question is whether choosing not to have a relationship with your child, even when the other parent wants to facilitate it, is morally wrong. \n\nI think the answer depends on legal and ethical perspectives. Legally, if there's no court order requiring contact, he's not in the wrong. Ethically, some might disagree, but legally he's compliant. The user's question is whether he's in the wrong, which is a moral question. The user's opinion is that he's not wrong, but maybe some would argue he is. However, since he's not violating any legal obligations, and the mother is the one initiating contact, his refusal might not make him wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
