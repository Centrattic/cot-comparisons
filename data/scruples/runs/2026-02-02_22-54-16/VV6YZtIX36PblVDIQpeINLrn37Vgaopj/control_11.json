I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not wanting any part in their child's life. The situation is that the person impregnated their girlfriend, didn't want kids, offered an abortion which she refused, then they broke up. He's been paying child support but has no contact. Now the ex wants to arrange a meeting, and he's refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal obligations. Child support is a legal responsibility, so he's fulfilling that. But in many places, parents have legal rights and responsibilities towards their children, including visitation unless there's a court order restricting it. If he hasn't been involved, the ex might have the right to enforce contact if she wants it for the child's benefit.\n\nEthically, it's complicated. He created a child and then walked away, but he's providing financially. However, children have a right to know their parents. The mother might be acting in the child's interest to have a relationship with the father. The father's refusal could be seen as neglecting his parental duties beyond just money.\n\nBut there are arguments for both sides. The father might have a right to privacy if he never wanted the child. However, the child's well-being is often prioritized. Legally, he might be in the wrong if he's blocking the mother's attempts to facilitate contact, unless he has a court order saying otherwise. If there's no court order, he could be violating his parental rights and duties by refusing contact, especially if the ex is trying to arrange it for the child's benefit.\n\nSo, depending on the jurisdiction, he might be in the wrong. But since the question is about being in the wrong, not strictly legal, it's also a moral question. Many would say that a parent has a responsibility beyond financial to be involved. However, if he's been consistent in his decision and the mother is trying to push for contact, it's a bit of a gray area. But overall, the consensus might lean towards him being in the wrong because he's denying the child a relationship with a parent. So answer A.\n"
