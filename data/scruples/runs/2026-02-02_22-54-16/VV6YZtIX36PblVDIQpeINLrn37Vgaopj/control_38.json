I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author impregnated his girlfriend, didn't want kids, offered to pay for an abortion, but she went ahead with the pregnancy. They broke up after four months, and he's been paying child support without any contact. Now, his ex wants him to meet their daughter, but he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, he's been fulfilling his child support obligations, so he's doing that right. But the question is about being in the wrong morally or ethically. \n\nThe author never wanted children and made that clear, which is understandable. However, once a child is born, the parent has a responsibility beyond financial support. There's a debate here: some might argue that a parent should be involved in their child's life, while others might respect the author's personal choice not to have kids. \n\nThe key points are: He's been paying support, he's had no contact, and he's now refusing to meet the child. The ex is trying to facilitate contact, which the author is blocking. From a moral standpoint, some people might think that even if he doesn't want to be involved, the child has a right to know their father. Others might argue that the father's autonomy should be respected, especially if he never wanted to be a parent. \n\nBut in many places, parental rights aren't just about financial support. There might be legal avenues for the mother to seek some form of visitation if she wants the child to have a relationship with the father. However, the author is refusing contact, which could be seen as abdicating his parental role. \n\nIn AITA threads, the community often considers the balance between personal freedom and responsibility. If the author is actively blocking the mother's efforts to include the child in his life, that could be seen as wrong because it's denying the child the opportunity to have a relationship with the father, even if the father isn't interested. \n\nSo, while the author isn't legally in the wrong (since he's paying support), ethically, some might say he's in the wrong for not at least allowing the child to know him. The answer might be A, but I need to make sure. However, there's also the argument that the father's lack of interest from the start should be respected. It's a tough call, but in many AITA discussions, people tend to side with the idea that children deserve parental involvement, even if the parent didn't choose to have kids. So the answer is likely A.\n"
