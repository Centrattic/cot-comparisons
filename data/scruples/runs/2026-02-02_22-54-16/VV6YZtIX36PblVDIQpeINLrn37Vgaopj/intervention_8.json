      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting to have a part in their child's life. Let me start by breaking down the details provided.\n\nSo, seven years ago, the author impregnated his girlfriend. He didn't want children and offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted to keep the child. They stayed together for about four months after the pregnancy was confirmed and then broke up. He agreed to pay child support through the courts and has never missed a payment. Since then, he's had no contact with his daughter except for sending a birthday gift through the mother with instructions to say it's from him. Recently, his ex wanted him to meet the daughter, but he refused and asked not to be contacted again about it. He's unsure if the daughter initiated the request or if the ex did.\n\nThe user says they think the author isn't in the wrong but are curious for my opinion. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. Child support is a legal obligation, and he's fulfilling that. However, parental rights and responsibilities aren't just financial. In many jurisdictions, once a parent has legal custody (which the mother has here, since he's not seeking custody), the non-custodial parent's visitation rights can be established. But if the non-custodial parent hasn't had contact and the custodial parent isn't pushing for it, maybe there's less legal pressure. However, laws vary by country, so without knowing the location, it's a bit tricky. But generally, child support is separate from visitation rights. So legally, he might not be in violation of any laws by not being involved beyond financial support.\n\nEthically or morally is a different angle. The author chose not to be a parent when the situation arose. He took responsibility by paying child support, which is commendable. However, some might argue that a child has a right to know their biological father, even if the father didn't want children initially. On the other hand, if the father felt coerced or never wanted to be a parent, forcing him to engage might be seen as unfair. There's also the aspect of the child's well-being; having a relationship with both parents (if possible) is generally considered beneficial, but that's not always feasible.\n\nThe author is clear that he never wanted children and has accepted the responsibility by paying support but hasn't sought to build a relationship. The mother has custody, and she's the one reaching out now. Maybe the child is asking about the father, which complicates things. If the child is interested in knowing the father, the author's refusal could be seen as denying the child a potential relationship. But if the mother initiated it without the child's input, the father's reluctance might be justified if he's not ready or doesn't want to be involved.\n\nAnother angle is consent and autonomy. The author made a choice not to be a parent but took on financial responsibility. He might feel that his autonomy is being infringed upon by being pressured to have contact. However, the child's right to have a relationship with both parents could be seen as a competing interest.\n\nIt's also possible that the author's stance is based on personal choice and values. He didn't want children and has honored the child's existence through financial support. But some might argue that being a parent isn't just about money; it's also about emotional and psychological investment. The author is avoiding that, which could be viewed as not fulfilling all aspects of parenthood.\n\nThere's also the question of the mother's role. If she's the one pushing for contact, maybe she's not respecting the father's wishes, but as the custodial parent, she might have a duty to consider the child's needs. However, if the father has legal visitation rights, he could also have a right to be part of the child's life, even if he's not the one seeking it.\n\nIn summary, legally, the author is not in the wrong because he's meeting his financial obligations. Morally, it's more ambiguous. Some people might believe that a parent has a duty to be involved in their child's life beyond just money, while others might respect the father's decision to not be a parent beyond financial responsibility. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal values.\n"
