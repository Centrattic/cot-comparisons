I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a father who never wanted kids, impregnated his girlfriend, offered an abortion but she went through with the pregnancy. They split up, he pays child support but has no contact with his daughter. Now the ex wants to meet the daughter with the father, but he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, parents have the right to have a relationship with their child unless there's a court order preventing it. The father is paying child support, which covers financial responsibility, but emotional and parental involvement is a different matter. However, if the mother is seeking visitation, the father's refusal might lead to legal issues if the court decides the child's best interest is to have contact with both parents.\n\nEthically, this is tricky. The father didn't want the child but accepted the responsibility financially. Not having any contact might be seen as neglecting a parental duty beyond finances. Some might argue that a child deserves to know their parent, even if the parent isn't a traditional one. On the other hand, the father might genuinely not want to be involved, and forcing contact could be a violation of his personal boundaries. However, the child's well-being is usually a priority in such cases.\n\nI should also consider cultural and societal norms. In many cultures, there's an expectation that parents stay involved in their children's lives. The father's complete disinterest might be viewed as selfish or harmful to the child's development. The mother's initiative to arrange a meeting could be for the child's benefit, which the father is dismissing.\n\nThe key points are: legal rights and responsibilities, the child's best interest, the father's right to personal choice, and ethical obligations beyond legal ones. The answer would hinge on whether the father's refusal to engage is harmful and if the law would enforce some form of contact. If the court has no restrictions, then legally he might not be in the wrong, but ethically, there's a strong case that he is neglecting his role as a parent. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which can be both legal and moral. The answer might be A (Yes) from an ethical standpoint, but B (No) if strictly legal. But typically, such questions consider both. The user probably wants to know if society would see him as wrong, which is more ethical. So, likely A.\n"
