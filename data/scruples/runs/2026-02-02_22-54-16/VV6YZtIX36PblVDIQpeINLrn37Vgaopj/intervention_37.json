I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting any part in their child's life. The situation is that the author impregnated a girlfriend who wanted to have the child, but the author didn't want kids. They split up after four months, settled on child support, and the author has maintained payments but no contact. Now the ex wants the author to meet their daughter, but the author refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In most places, parents have a legal duty to provide financial support, which the author is fulfilling. There's also the aspect of custody and visitation. If the court didn't grant the author visitation rights, then he might not be obligated to have contact. But if there's a court order for visitation, not complying could be an issue. However, the author hasn't been contacted about this until now, so maybe there's no existing order.\n\nNext, the ethical and emotional side. The author never wanted kids, so feeling uninterested isn't unusual. However, children have a right to know their parents, especially if it's in their best interest. The author is providing financially but not emotionally. There's a debate here about parental responsibility beyond just money. Some might argue that the child has a right to a relationship with both parents, while others might say the author isn't at fault for not wanting to be a parent.\n\nThe author's actions so far\u2014paying support, not seeking contact\u2014might be legally okay but could be ethically questionable. The key points are the author's lack of interest despite the financial responsibility. The ex is now trying to get them to meet, which the author refuses. The question is whether this refusal is wrong.\n\nI should also consider cultural and societal norms. In some cultures, parental involvement is expected, while others might be more lenient if the parent isn't wanted or wanted by the other parent. The author's stance is clear: they don't want any part, which could be seen as neglecting a parental duty beyond financial. But legally, unless there's a court order, they might not be in the wrong. However, morally, some might see it as abandoning the child.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether financial support alone is sufficient as parental responsibility. If the law requires visitation or contact, then the author is in the wrong. If not, then maybe not. But if the child's well-being is considered, the author's refusal could harm the child's relationship with the father. However, the author's personal feelings are valid, and they didn't seek parenthood. It's a tricky balance between legal obligations and ethical considerations.\n\nIn conclusion, legally, the author might be fine if they're meeting financial obligations. Ethically, there's a gray area. The answer depends on the jurisdiction and specific legal requirements, but based on the given info, the author might not be in the wrong legally, but some might argue ethically they are neglecting their role. Since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which can be both legal and ethical, but the user is asking for a yes or no based on the scenario.\n"
