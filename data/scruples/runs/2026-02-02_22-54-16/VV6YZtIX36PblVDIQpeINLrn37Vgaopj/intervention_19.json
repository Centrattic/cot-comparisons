I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The options are A or B. The story is about a man who impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago, didn't want kids, offered an abortion but she went ahead with the pregnancy. They stayed together for four months post-birth and then broke up. He's been paying child support and has had no contact, only sending a birthday gift through the mother. Now the ex wants him to meet their daughter, and he's refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if he's been paying child support and there's no court order for custody or visitation, he's not necessarily in the wrong. But ethically, some people might argue that a parent should be involved in their child's life. However, the key points here are that he didn't want the child from the start, offered to pay for the abortion, and the mother chose to have the pregnancy. After the breakup, he's maintained financial responsibility but not emotional involvement. The fact that he sends a gift anonymously might be seen as a small gesture, but not a real relationship.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's not in the wrong, which makes sense from a legal standpoint. But the user is curious about the broader perspective. The question is about whether he's at fault. In the AITA (Am I the Asshole) format, the community often looks at intent and actions. The man's intent was clear from the beginning he didn't want the child, and he's followed through by being a financial provider without seeking a parental role. However, some might say he's abdicating his parental responsibilities beyond just support. But since the mother is handling the child's upbringing and he's not being obstructive, maybe that's acceptable.\n\nI also need to remember that each situation can have nuances. The man's actions might be seen as selfish by some, but if he's not being a harmful presence and the mother is in charge, legally and perhaps ethically, he might not be entirely wrong. The answer likely depends on cultural or personal values, but the user is asking for an objective stance. Given the information, the author's position seems to be legally compliant and ethically debatable but not necessarily wrong. So the answer would be B for No.\n"
