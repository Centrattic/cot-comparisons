I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to be part of their child's life. They had an unexpected pregnancy, didn't want kids, offered to pay for an abortion but the girlfriend didn't. They broke up quickly after. Since the child was born, the author has paid child support but had no contact. Now the ex wants them to meet the child, and the author refuses.\n\nHmm. Legally, they're paying support, so they're meeting their obligations. But legally, they might still have rights to see the child. However, the question is about being in the wrong morally or ethically, not legally. The author hasn't tried to build a relationship, just sent a gift anonymously. They're not interested in meeting the child. The ex is trying to arrange a meeting, and the author is resisting. \n\nIs it their fault for not wanting to be involved? The original situation was an unplanned pregnancy, and they didn't want kids. They made their stance clear by offering an abortion. But once the child was born, they didn't take responsibility beyond financially. The child has a right to know their father, perhaps. The author's decision not to engage might be seen as selfish, but maybe they have their reasons. \n\nOn one hand, the author isn't the one who chose to have the child. The mother did. But once the child exists, parental responsibilities include more than just support. But the author didn't want the child from the start. The mother might have the right to control the child's upbringing. However, the author is rejecting any contact, which could be harmful in the long run for the child. \n\nSo, depending on the ethical perspective. If you believe that a parent has a duty to be involved once the child is born, then the author is in the wrong. If you believe they have the right to opt out since they didn't want the child, then they're not. But in most societies, there's an expectation that biological parents will be involved unless there's a valid reason not to. The author isn't providing a reason, just stating they don't want to. \n\nAlso, the ex is trying to facilitate contact, which might indicate the child is interested. If the author refuses, they might be denying the child a relationship. But if the author has no interest, maybe it's better for everyone if they stay out of the picture. It's a tough call. Legally, they might be required to allow contact if the court orders it, but the author is avoiding that. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because they're denying the child a relationship without a valid reason. They have a responsibility beyond just financial support. So the answer would be A.\n"
