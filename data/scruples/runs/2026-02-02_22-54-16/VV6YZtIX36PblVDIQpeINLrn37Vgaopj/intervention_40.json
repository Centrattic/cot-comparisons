I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author got his girlfriend pregnant when he didn't want kids, offered an abortion, but she wanted to keep the child. They broke up after four months, he paid child support through the courts, and hasn't had contact with his daughter. Now his ex wants him to meet the kid, but he's not interested.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, child support is a legal obligation even if the parent doesn't have custody or contact. The author has been paying support, so legally he's meeting his responsibility. But sometimes, courts may require some level of contact for the child's best interest. However, the author hasn't been in contact, only sending a gift once. That might be a gray area. If the ex is trying to arrange a meeting, maybe there's a legal expectation for the father to be involved, especially if the child is old enough to want to know more about him.\n\nEthically, the author didn't want children and didn't push for an abortion, which the ex wanted. He's providing financially but not emotionally. Some might argue that a child has a right to know both parents, even if the parent isn't interested. But others might say that the father's right to choose not to be involved is valid, especially if he's already fulfilling the legal duty.\n\nThe ex's perspective is also important. If the child is reaching out, the father might be seen as a neglectful parent. However, if the ex is the one pushing without the child's input, then maybe the author's refusal is justified. The key points are the author's consistent child support and no contact beyond a gift. The answer depends on balancing legal obligations with ethical considerations. The author isn't in the wrong legally, but ethically, it's more complex. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and given that he's met the legal requirements, the answer might be B.\n"
