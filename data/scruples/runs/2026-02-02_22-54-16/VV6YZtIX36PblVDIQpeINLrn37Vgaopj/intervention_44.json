I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who accidentally impregnated his girlfriend, didn't want children, offered to pay for an abortion but she went ahead with the pregnancy. They broke up after four months. He's been paying child support and sending a birthday gift through the mother. Now the ex wants him to meet their daughter and he refuses. The user thinks the author is not wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, he's fulfilling his obligations with child support, so he's not in legal trouble. But ethically? Well, the kid is his child. He didn't want to be a parent, but once the child is born, does he have a responsibility to provide some level of relationship or contact?\n\nSome might argue that a child has the right to know their biological father, especially as they grow older. The father's complete disinterest might be seen as neglectful or harmful to the child's well-being. On the other hand, the father clearly communicated his stance from the beginning, so he might not be in the wrong if he's been consistent and met his financial responsibilities.\n\nBut then there's the emotional aspect. The child's mother is reaching out, perhaps because the child is curious about the father. The father's refusal to engage at all could be seen as selfish or irresponsible. However, if the father truly has no desire to be involved, maybe it's his right to choose that path, as long as he meets legal obligations.\n\nI need to check if there are any laws about parental contact. In many places, a non-custodial parent can choose to limit contact unless there's a court order. So legally, he's allowed to refuse. Ethically, it's a gray area. Some might say it's his right to disengage if he's unprepared, while others might argue that being a parent comes with inherent responsibilities beyond just financial support.\n\nThe user's stance is that the author isn't wrong, but the answer might depend on societal expectations versus individual rights. If the father is happy with his decision and fulfilling his obligations, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the potential impact on the child's life is a factor. But since the question is about the author's wrongdoing, and he's not breaking any laws or violating the court's terms, the answer could be B (not in the wrong). But I should consider if there's any moral obligation beyond the legal one here.\n"
