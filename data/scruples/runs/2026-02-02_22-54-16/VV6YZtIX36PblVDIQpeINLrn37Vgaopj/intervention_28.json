I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author impregnated his girlfriend, didn't want children, offered to pay for an abortion, but she went ahead with the pregnancy. They stayed together for four months and then broke up. The author has been paying child support but has had no contact with the child, only sending a birthday gift through the mother.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider the moral and legal aspects here. Legally, the author is fulfilling their obligation by paying child support, so they are meeting the court's requirements. That part is clear. Morally, it's more complex. The author was against having the child from the start, which is a significant factor. They didn't push for the pregnancy to continue and provided financial support. However, the child has a right to know their father, even if the author doesn't want to be involved. \n\nThe key points are: the author's initial opposition to the child, providing financial support, no contact, and now the mother wants to arrange a meeting. The author refuses any contact. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. In many jurisdictions, a parent's right to refuse contact can be a legal issue, especially if it's deemed harmful to the child's well-being. But the user is asking from a moral standpoint, not legal. \n\nMoral responsibility might include considering the child's best interests. The author's complete disinterest in any relationship, despite being a parent, could be seen as selfish. However, if the author truly never wanted a child and the mother made the choice to have the baby, the author might feel they are being forced into a role they didn't choose. But the child is a human being with needs, and the father's absence could affect her development. \n\nThe author's actions are technically following the law but may be morally questionable. The mother's desire to introduce the child to the father could be seen as trying to provide a complete family picture, but if the father is unwilling, the mother might need to respect that. However, the father's lack of involvement might be harming the child's ability to have a relationship with her biological parent. \n\nIn AITA contexts, the community often evaluates intentions and actions beyond just the legalities. The author didn't want the child and made that clear, which might be considered if the mother didn't inform him. But the author is paying support and hasn't been involved, which some might see as fulfilling obligations, while others might argue that being a parent involves more than just financial support. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because, while they are financially responsible, the emotional and parental responsibilities are also important. The child deserves to know her father if he's willing and the mother is trying to facilitate that. The author's refusal to even consider a meeting could be seen as neglecting that part of the child's life. So, maybe answer A.\n"
