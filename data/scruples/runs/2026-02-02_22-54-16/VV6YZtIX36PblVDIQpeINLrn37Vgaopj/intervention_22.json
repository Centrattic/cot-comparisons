I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the question is in the wrong for not wanting to be involved with their child. The situation is that the author didn't want kids and offered to pay for an abortion when they got their girlfriend pregnant. The girlfriend wanted to keep the child, they stayed together briefly, then broke up. The author has been paying child support but hasn't had any contact with the daughter, only sending a birthday gift through the mother. Recently, the ex wants the author to meet the daughter, but the author refuses contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author is paying child support, which is a legal requirement. However, legal responsibility doesn't always equate to moral or ethical responsibility. In many jurisdictions, parents have a legal duty to support their children financially, but visitation rights might depend on court orders or agreements. If the author hasn't been involved, the ex might have custody, and the author's lack of contact could be due to their own choice rather than legal restrictions.\n\nThen there's the moral question. The author didn't want a child and made that clear. But once a child is born, do they have a moral obligation to be part of the child's life? Some might argue that a child has the right to know both parents, especially if it's feasible and in their best interest. However, the author has been paying financially, which is a significant part of support. The emotional or personal involvement is another aspect. The author is not the one seeking contact; they're resisting when approached. The ex might be trying to facilitate the relationship, but the author is not interested.\n\nAnother angle is the initial decision to not have the child. The author offered to pay for an abortion, but the mother chose to carry the pregnancy. This could lead to some ethical debates about consent and shared responsibility. However, after the child is born, the author's rights and obligations are established, and their refusal to engage beyond financial support is their choice unless there's a court order requiring visitation.\n\nAlso, considering the child's well-being, it's possible that having a relationship with the father could be beneficial, but if the father is unwilling, it's not in the child's interest to force contact if it's not positive. The author hasn't shown any interest in being a parent, so pushing for a relationship might not be healthy for the child either. However, some might argue that the father's presence, even if distant, is better than none.\n\nThe author's actions might be seen as neglecting a parental role, but legally, they're fulfilling their obligation. The question is whether the author is morally wrong. If someone doesn't want children and made that clear but is still a parent, they might feel they're not at fault for not wanting to be involved. However, others might say that being a parent, even unwillingly, comes with responsibilities beyond financial support.\n\nIn summary, the answer could hinge on whether the author is legally required to have contact. If not, and they're fulfilling financial obligations, they might not be in the wrong. But if the court has set visitation rights, refusing could be problematic. Since the user mentions the author isn't interested in contact and hasn't had any, unless there's a court order, they might not be in the wrong. However, ethically, some might argue that the author should reconsider to meet the child's needs.\n"
