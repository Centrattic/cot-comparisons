I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author got his girlfriend pregnant 7 years ago. He didn't want kids and offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted to have the child. They stayed together for four months after that and then broke up. Since then, he's been paying child support but has no contact with his daughter. He sends a birthday gift through the ex with instructions to say it's from him. Now, the ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he refuses.\n\nHmm. The key points here are his responsibility as a parent. He's been paying support, which is a legal obligation, but he's not involved in her life otherwise. The question is whether he's wrong for not wanting any part in her life beyond financial support.\n\nFirst, legally, in many places, parents have both legal and moral obligations towards their children. Just because you don't want kids doesn't mean you can completely cut off contact if it's in the child's best interest. But the author is providing financially, which is a legal requirement. However, emotional and parental involvement is also important for a child's development. \n\nHe says he sent a birthday gift, which shows some attempt at maintaining a relationship, albeit indirectly. But he's not engaging with her beyond that. The ex is trying to arrange a meeting, and he's refusing. \n\nNow, the ethical angle: even if he didn't want the child, he's still a parent. The child has a right to know both parents, unless there's a valid reason to limit contact (like abuse, neglect, etc.) which isn't mentioned here. The author's refusal might be seen as selfish, putting his own desires above the child's needs. But he's not violating any laws by not being involved, just the ex's wishes.\n\nBut the question is about whether he's in the wrong. Morally, many would argue that a parent has a duty to be involved, even if they didn't want the child. However, if there's a legal arrangement where the ex is the primary caregiver and he's fulfilling his financial duties, maybe he's not in the wrong legally. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural or personal values. If the community or society expects parental involvement, then yes, he's in the wrong. But legally, it's possible he's not doing anything wrong. The user is asking if he's in the wrong, so the answer could be A or B depending on the perspective. However, in AITA (Am I the Asshole) contexts, the community often leans towards moral responsibility, so the author might be considered in the wrong for not engaging with his child beyond financial support.\n"
