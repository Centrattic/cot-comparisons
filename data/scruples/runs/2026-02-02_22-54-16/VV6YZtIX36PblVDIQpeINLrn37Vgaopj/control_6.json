I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago, didn't want children, offered to pay for an abortion but she went ahead with the pregnancy. They broke up after four months, he's been paying child support and has had no contact with the child. Recently, the ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, he's fulfilling his obligation by paying child support, so he's not violating any laws. But ethically, there's a question about his responsibility towards the child. Even if he didn't want kids, once the child is born, he has a parental responsibility. However, the mother is the primary caregiver, and in many cases, courts might not force a parent to have contact if it's against their will, unless it's in the child's best interest. But the mother is the one trying to arrange the meeting, so maybe she's the one asserting the child's right to know the father. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is being non-responsive and is avoiding any contact. Even though he's providing financially, emotional absence can affect the child. But if he's not the one initiating contact and the mother is the one trying to connect them, is he in the wrong for not wanting to be involved? Some people might argue that the child has a right to know their parent, but if the father is against it, does he have a right to refuse? \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs. Legally, he's not in the wrong, but morally, some might say he has a duty to at least consider the child's welfare. However, if he's been consistent in his disinterest and has no intention of changing that, the courts might not force him. But if the mother is trying to include the father, and he's actively refusing, then maybe he's in the wrong from a moral standpoint. But the question is whether he is in the wrong, not just legally. \n\nIn some cultures, paternal involvement is expected, so not being involved could be seen as wrong. Others might respect his decision if it's his personal choice. The key points are his consistent non-contact and refusal to engage despite the mother's efforts. The answer could be A (in the wrong) because he's avoiding all contact and not considering the child's potential need for a relationship with him, even if it's the mother's initiative. Alternatively, B if it's his right to not want to be involved. The line here is thin, but I think the consensus might lean towards A because parental responsibility includes some form of involvement beyond financial support. So the author is in the wrong."
