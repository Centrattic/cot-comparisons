I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a man who didn't want children, impregnated his girlfriend, offered an abortion which she refused, then they broke up. He's been paying child support but has no contact with his daughter. Now his ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he refuses and asks her not to contact him again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal obligations. He's been paying child support as ordered by the court, so legally, he's fulfilling his duty. But legally, does he have a responsibility to have contact with the child? In many jurisdictions, child support is about financial responsibility, not necessarily custody or visitation. Unless there's a court order for visitation, he might not be legally obligated to have contact. However, if the ex is trying to arrange meetings, maybe there's a legal aspect if she's supposed to facilitate contact as part of custody arrangements. But the user didn't mention that, so maybe it's not applicable here.\n\nEthically, this is more complex. The man doesn't want any part in his daughter's life, which some might see as neglectful. The child has a right to know her father, especially if he's been distant. But the man's stance is that he never wanted children. There's a debate here between the parent's rights and the child's needs. Some people argue that once you become a parent, you have responsibilities beyond just financial support. Others might respect his decision if it's genuine and he's not using the child for emotional reasons.\n\nHe sends a birthday gift, which is a small gesture, but he doesn't want contact. The ex contacting him about meeting the daughter might be an attempt to involve him, which he's blocking. Depending on the custody arrangement, if the ex has sole custody, she might have the right to decide who the child interacts with. However, if the father has any visitation rights, refusing to participate could be an issue. But again, the user hasn't mentioned any such rights, so maybe it's a matter of his personal choice.\n\nPublic opinion might split here. Some would say he's being selfish and avoiding his parental duties beyond money. Others might say he's being honest about his feelings and not forcing a relationship that's not wanted. The key factors here are the legal framework, the child's best interest, and the father's personal beliefs.\n\nIn terms of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) framework, if the father is not violating any court orders and is fulfilling his financial obligations, he might not be in the wrong. However, ethically, some might say he's neglecting his parental responsibilities. The answer could depend on cultural or societal norms as well. In some places, active disengagement from a child's life might be seen as neglectful, but if it's legally permissible, the court might not hold him accountable.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) if there's no legal obligation for contact. However, ethically, it's a gray area. The user's situation doesn't mention any legal orders for visitation, so legally, he's okay. Ethically, it's a personal choice versus societal expectations. The final answer would be B, but with a note that while he's not legally in the wrong, there's ethical debate.\n"
