      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not wanting to be part of their child's life. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nSo, the person impregnated their girlfriend seven years ago. They didn't want kids and offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted to keep the child. They stayed together for four months after the pregnancy and then broke up. He's been paying child support consistently through the courts and hasn't missed a payment. He's had no contact with his daughter, only sending a birthday gift through the ex with instructions it's from him. Recently, the ex wants to arrange a meeting, but he declined.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, he's fulfilling his financial responsibilities, so he's probably not in legal trouble. But the ethical or moral part is trickier. Legally, he might have no obligation beyond child support unless there's a court order for custody or visitation. But in many places, parental rights and responsibilities extend beyond just financial support. However, if the mother has sole custody and there's no court-ordered visitation, he might not be legally obligated to be involved beyond support.\n\nMoral or ethical considerations are where this gets complicated. Some people might argue that a parent has a responsibility to be involved in a child's life, regardless of their initial feelings. Others might say that if he never wanted children and the mother is capable of raising the child, his decision isn't necessarily wrong. However, the child might have a right to know their father, especially as they grow older. The fact that he's been entirely absent except for financial support could be seen as neglecting a parent's role beyond just money.\n\nAlso, the ex's recent attempt to arrange a meeting might indicate that the child is curious about her father. The father's refusal could be seen as avoiding responsibility, which might harm the child's understanding of their family. On the other hand, if he genuinely feels he's not a good fit for the role of a father, maybe he's acting in the child's best interest by not being a bad influence. But that's a big assumption to make.\n\nIt's also possible that the mother is pushing for contact, which could complicate things. If the mother is trying to facilitate this arrangement, maybe there's an existing custody or visitation agreement he's not considering. If there's no such agreement, he might have the right to refuse, but it's still a sensitive issue.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's often an expectation that biological parents should have some level of involvement unless there's a valid reason (like abuse or neglect). The father's complete disinterest might be seen as selfish, even if he's providing financially. However, others might respect his decision to be honest about his feelings and not pretend to be a parent he's not.\n\nThe key factors here are the legal obligations, the child's best interests, and the father's capacity to be involved. Since he's paying child support and hasn't been involved otherwise, it's a gray area. Legally, he might not be in the wrong, but morally or ethically, there could be arguments for both sides. However, without a legal requirement for visitation, his stance might be defensible. But the ethical side is more subjective. The answer might depend on the specific laws of the jurisdiction, but since the user is asking about being \"in the wrong,\" which includes moral judgment, there's a case to be made that he is neglecting a parental duty beyond financial support, making him at least partially in the wrong.\n"
