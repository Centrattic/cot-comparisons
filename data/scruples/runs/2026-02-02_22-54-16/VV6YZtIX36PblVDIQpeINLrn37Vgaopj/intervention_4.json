I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author got his girlfriend pregnant, didn't want kids, offered to pay for an abortion, she decided to keep the child, they broke up, he pays child support but hasn't had contact with the child. Now the ex wants to arrange a meeting, but he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, fathers have legal obligations to provide financial support, but do they have the right to be involved with the child? If the child was born after a breakup and there's no joint custody or visitation rights established by the court, the father might not have a legal right to be involved. So legally, he might not be in the wrong for not wanting contact if there's no court order requiring it.\n\nEthically, it's more complex. Some people might argue that a biological father has a moral responsibility to be part of the child's life, especially if he's paying support. Others might say that if the father never wanted children and there's no existing relationship, he's not obligated to create one. The key points here are consent, the child's best interests, and the father's initial decision not to parent.\n\nThe father did take responsibility by paying child support, which is a significant part of being a parent. However, some might say that support alone isn't enough and that emotional involvement is important for the child. On the other hand, if the father isn't wanted by the mother or the child, forcing contact could be harmful.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. So, considering the information, the answer would depend on societal norms and personal ethics. Legally, he's probably not in the wrong. Ethically, it's debatable. But since the question is about being in the wrong in general, not just legally, the answer might lean towards B (No) because he's fulfilling his financial obligation, and there's no legal mandate for contact. However, some might still think he has a moral duty.\n"
