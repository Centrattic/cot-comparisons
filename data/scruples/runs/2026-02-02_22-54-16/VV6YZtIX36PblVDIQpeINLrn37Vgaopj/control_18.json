I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author impregnated his ex-girlfriend, didn't want kids, offered to pay for an abortion but she wanted to keep the child. They broke up after four months. He pays child support but has no contact, just sends a birthday gift through the mother. Now the ex wants him to meet their daughter, but he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, child support obligations are legal, so he's meeting that by not missing payments. But parental rights... even if he didn't want kids, once a child is born, he is a legal parent. Depending on the country, parents might have a right to have a relationship with their child unless there's a court restriction. But he's been avoiding contact. If he's blocking contact, maybe that's an issue. However, in some jurisdictions, if a parent has been absent for a long time, the court might consider that as relinquishing rights, but I'm not sure about the specifics here.\n\nEthically, it's more complex. The child has a right to know both parents, but if the father never wanted a child and has been absent, does he have a responsibility to be involved? On one hand, he's providing financially, which is important. On the other hand, emotional and personal involvement is also important for the child's well-being. However, the father might feel that he didn't choose to be a parent and that his rights shouldn't be forced upon him. But there's also an argument that once a child exists, the parent has responsibilities beyond just financial support.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, he might not be in the wrong if he's fulfilling his child support and has no court-ordered contact. But ethically, there's a gray area. Some might say that he is responsible for more than just money, while others might respect his choice not to be involved if he wasn't interested from the start. However, the ex is reaching out now, possibly at the child's request, which could be a new situation. If the child wants to know the father, the father's refusal could be seen as withholding a relationship from the child.\n\nBut maybe the father is being realistic about his own desires and isn't willing to pretend to be a parent. It's a tough call. In some cultures or legal systems, parental rights are absolute unless taken away by the court. In others, absence might lead to termination of rights. Without knowing the exact jurisdiction, it's hard to say. But generally, if he hasn't been in contact, but is paying support, he's not necessarily in the wrong legally, but ethically, there's a debate. The answer might depend on whether the father is legally required to have contact. Since the ex is trying to arrange a meeting, and he's refusing, if there's no court order requiring contact, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But if there's a duty to allow relationship-building, then he is.\n\nIn the US, for example, the courts might prioritize the child's interest in having a relationship with both parents, unless there's harm involved. Since he hasn't been involved, the ex might need to go to court to establish visitation, and if he refuses, he could be in trouble. But if there's no court order, he can choose not to. However, the question is about being in the wrong, which is more of a moral judgment. From a moral standpoint, even if he's not legally wrong, some would say he's in the wrong because the child has a right to both parents. Others might say he's not wrong because he never wanted to be a parent. It's a tough one.\n"
