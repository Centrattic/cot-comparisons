I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who didn't want kids, impregnated his girlfriend, offered to pay for an abortion but she wanted to keep the child. They broke up after four months. He's been paying child support and has no contact with his daughter. Now the ex wants him to meet the kid, and he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, child support is a legal requirement, but visitation rights might be another matter. Since he never fought for custody or visitation, maybe he's not legally obligated to be involved. However, some jurisdictions might require reasonable visitation unless there's a reason to restrict it, like abuse or neglect. But the user says he's never missed a payment, so he's fulfilling his financial responsibility.\n\nEthically, this is trickier. The child has a right to know her father, even if the father doesn't want a relationship. But the father's right to make that choice is also a factor. He wasn't a willing parent, so imposing a relationship on him might be against his autonomy. However, the child's well-being is a consideration too. Some people might argue that the father is in the wrong because children deserve both parents, but others might respect his right to choose not to be involved.\n\nThere's also the issue of the mother's role. She wanted the child and presumably takes care of her. The father's minimal contact (birthday gifts) might be seen as a way to satisfy the child's curiosity without commitment. However, some might see this as insufficient and that the father is avoiding responsibility.\n\nThe user says they're not in the wrong, but I need to weigh both sides. Legally, maybe he's not in the wrong if he's following court orders. Ethically, it's more subjective. If the father is mentally and emotionally not prepared to be a parent, forcing him into a relationship could be harmful to both parties. But the child might benefit from knowing her father, even if it's a limited relationship.\n\nIn some cases, people might criticize the father for not engaging more, but others might understand his stance. The key points are his consistent child support, lack of contact, and refusal when asked. The answer depends on societal expectations and legal standards. Since the question is about being in the wrong, if he's not violating any laws or court orders, he might not be in the wrong. But if there's a legal requirement for visitation that he's avoiding, then he might be. Without more legal details, it's hard to say, but since he's not missing payments and the court didn't specify visitation, the answer might lean towards B.\n"
