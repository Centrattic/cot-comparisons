I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author impregnating a girlfriend, not wanting children, offering to pay for an abortion but she wanted to keep the baby. They broke up after four months. The author has paid child support consistently but has zero contact with the child. Now the ex wants the author to meet the daughter, but he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, child support obligations are legal, so the author is fulfilling that part. But legal obligations don't always cover parental responsibilities beyond financial support. Legally, the father might have rights and responsibilities, but if he's not been involved, there could be complexities. Some jurisdictions require reasonable contact, but this varies. The user didn't specify the country, but in the US, for example, a parent can be ordered to have visitation if the child's best interest is considered. However, since he's been absent, the court might have made arrangements. But the author hasn't been contacted by the court, so maybe the ex hasn't pursued it.\n\nEthically, this is more subjective. The child has a right to know their father, but the father has the right to choose not to be involved. However, the father's right might be balanced against the child's welfare. If the mother is pushing for contact, maybe the father's refusal could be seen as neglecting the child's emotional needs. But the father might argue that his absence is due to personal choice and that he's fulfilling his financial duties. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as neglecting his parental role beyond financial support. Even though he's paying child support, being a parent involves more than money. On the other hand, he's not forcing contact; he's just choosing not to engage. The mother might have responsibilities to protect the child's interests, perhaps by seeking legal intervention if necessary. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, if there's no court-ordered contact, he's not violating any laws. Ethically, it's debatable. Some might say he's avoiding responsibility, others might respect his choice. However, in terms of the child's best interest, being denied a relationship with a parent could be harmful. But since he never wanted children, maybe it's a matter of personal rights versus the child's rights. \n\nI think the answer hinges on legal obligations versus ethical responsibilities. If the law requires parental involvement beyond financial support, he's in the wrong. If not, then ethically it's a grey area. Since the user is asking for a yes or no, but without specific legal context, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong ethically, but legally not necessarily. However, the question might be from an ethical standpoint. If the community (AITA) considers emotional neglect as wrong, then A (yes). If they see it as his right to choose, then B (no). \n\nIn the Reddit AITA context, typically, the community might view the father's refusal to have any contact as neglectful, especially if the mother is trying to facilitate a relationship. They might emphasize the child's right to a relationship with both parents. So the answer might be A.\n"
