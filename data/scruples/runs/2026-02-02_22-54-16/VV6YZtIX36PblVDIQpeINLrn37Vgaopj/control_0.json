I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who impregnated his girlfriend, didn't want children, offered to pay for an abortion but she went ahead with the pregnancy. They broke up after four months, he's been paying child support but has no contact with the child. Now the ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he's refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, child support is a legal obligation, and the father has certain rights and responsibilities. Even if he didn't want to be involved, the law might require him to have some contact or custody. However, the question isn't just about legal rights but moral or ethical responsibility.\n\nEthically, the man chose to be a parent by not getting an abortion. Even if it was against his wishes, once the child was born, he has a responsibility towards her. Paying child support is part of that, but emotional and personal involvement is another aspect. The father is sending a birthday gift, which shows some level of care, but he's avoiding any direct contact. The daughter might be curious about her biological father, and he's denying her that relationship. \n\nThe mother is trying to facilitate a meeting, which the father is blocking. From a child's perspective, having both parents involved is generally considered beneficial, unless there are valid reasons (like abuse or neglect). There's no mention of such issues here, so maybe the father is being selfish or neglecting his parental duties beyond financial support.\n\nBut then again, the father wasn't the one who wanted the child. He was against it from the start. However, once a child is born, parental rights and responsibilities come into play regardless of the initial intentions. So, while he's fulfilling the financial part, he's not providing any emotional support or presence, which could be harmful to the child in the long run.\n\nLegally, depending on the country, the father might be required to have some contact. If the court ordered child support but didn't mandate involvement, maybe he's not legally wrong. But ethically, he's avoiding a relationship with his child, which could be seen as abandonment. \n\nThe user's answer options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). Considering the ethical responsibility of a parent beyond just financial support, and the potential impact on the child, the answer is likely A. The father is neglecting his parental duties by not engaging with his child, even if he didn't want to be a parent initially.\n"
