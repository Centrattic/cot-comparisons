I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting any part in their child's life. Let me read through the details again.\n\nSo, seven years ago, the author impregnated his girlfriend. He didn't want kids, offered her an abortion, but she chose to keep the child. They stayed together for four months and then broke up. He's been paying child support consistently, never missing a payment. He hasn't had contact with his daughter, only sending a birthday gift through her mother. Now, the ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he refuses and asks her not to contact him again. He's unsure if the ex or the child initiated it.\n\nHmm. Legally, he's been paying support, so he's meeting his financial obligations. But what about parental rights and responsibilities? In many places, parents have a legal duty to have some relationship with their child, not just financially. But the author is cutting off contact, which might be a problem. \n\nThe key points here are the child's best interests. Even if the father didn't want kids, once the child is born, he has legal and ethical responsibilities beyond just money. The child might have a right to know her father, especially as she grows up. The father's refusal to engage could be seen as neglecting his parental duties, even if he's meeting the financial ones.\n\nAlso, depending on the jurisdiction, the mother might have the right to facilitate contact, and the father's refusal could lead to legal action. But the question is about moral responsibility, not just legal. Ethically, many would argue that a parent should be involved in their child's life beyond money. The author's actions might be harming the child's emotional and psychological well-being by denying her a relationship with her father.\n\nSo, even though the father isn't in contact, he's been paying support. However, the lack of any relationship could be considered wrong. The answer might be A (in the wrong) because he's not fulfilling his parental role beyond financial support. But some might argue that he's not in the wrong if he never wanted children and the mother didn't push for contact. However, the general consensus is that children need both parents' involvement. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
