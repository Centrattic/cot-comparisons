I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who doesn't want any part in his child's life. He impregnated his girlfriend when he didn't want kids and offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted to keep the child. They stayed together a short time, then broke up. He pays child support but has no contact. Now his ex wants him to meet their daughter, but he refuses.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. I need to consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, parents have rights and responsibilities. Even if he's not the one seeking contact, he can't unilaterally deny the child the chance to know their father unless there's a legal reason. But he hasn't missed any court-ordered payments, so that's covered.\n\nEthically, it's more complex. The father has been completely absent, only sending a birthday gift through the mother. The mother might be trying to facilitate contact, but maybe the child is curious about the father. Legally, the father might have the right to refuse contact if there's no court order for visitation. However, some jurisdictions require fathers to maintain contact with their children for the child's best interest. If the court ordered visitation, he could be in the wrong. But the story doesn't mention any such order. The initial settlement was about child support.\n\nBut even without court-ordered contact, there's the ethical duty as a parent. The child has a right to know their father unless there's a valid reason (like abuse). Since the father isn't providing any reason here, just disinterest, ethically he might be neglecting his parental responsibility. So, even if he's not legally compelled to have contact, he's morally in the wrong for denying the child a relationship. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
