I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who impregnated his girlfriend, didn't want children, offered an abortion, but she decided to have the child. They broke up after a few months, and he's been paying child support but has no contact with his daughter. Now the ex wants him to meet the daughter, and he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, he's fulfilling his obligation by paying child support, which is often required by court orders. So he's probably not in legal trouble there. But ethically, it's more complex. The author has chosen not to have any relationship with his child beyond financial support. Some might argue that a child has a right to know their father, especially if the father is financially involved. Others might say that if he never wanted children and isn't a present parent, he's not in the wrong because he's respecting the mother's decision.\n\nHowever, there's a debate about parental rights and responsibilities. Even if he didn't want the child, once the child is born, there's a responsibility beyond just financial support. The author is avoiding any contact, which could be seen as neglecting his parental duties. On the other hand, he's not trying to interfere; he's just not engaging. The mother is trying to arrange a meeting now, but he's refusing. \n\nI should also consider cultural and personal values. In some societies, a father's presence is considered crucial, while in others, the mother's primary role is accepted. The key here is that he's not hindering the mother's ability to raise the child but is choosing not to be involved. The question is whether that choice makes him in the wrong.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the child's best interest. If the child is growing up without a father but with sufficient support, maybe it's not his fault. But if possible, some contact might be beneficial. However, the author has no interest, so forcing him to engage might not be fair. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a gray area. Legally, he's okay. Ethically, opinions might differ. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) if we consider his right to not be involved, but others might argue A (in the wrong) because of the child's potential need for a father. However, since he's not obstructing the mother and is financially responsible, the more balanced view might be that he's not in the wrong.\n"
