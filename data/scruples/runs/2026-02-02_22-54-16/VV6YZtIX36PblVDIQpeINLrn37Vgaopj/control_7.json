I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be involved in their child's life. The situation is that the author impregnated his girlfriend, didn't want children, offered to pay for an abortion, but the girlfriend went ahead with the pregnancy. They broke up after four months, and the author has been paying child support but has had no contact with the child. Now the ex wants the author to meet the daughter, but he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal obligations. In many places, parents have legal responsibilities towards their children, including providing financial support, which the author is doing. However, there's also the aspect of parental rights and responsibilities beyond just financial support. Even if the author didn't want to be a parent, once a child is born, there are legal and ethical considerations about being involved in their life.\n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The author didn't want the child, and the mother chose to continue the pregnancy against his wishes. But once the child is born, the child has a right to have a relationship with both parents unless there's some legal reason preventing that. The author might argue that he never wanted to be a parent, but the child's best interests are usually the primary concern in such matters.\n\nThere's also the question of consent. The child is now 7 years old, so they might have their own feelings about wanting to know their father. The fact that the ex is trying to arrange a meeting could indicate that the child is interested. The author's refusal might be seen as denying the child a relationship with their father, which some might view as inconsiderate or selfish, even if the author wasn't part of the decision to have the child.\n\nHowever, the author has been paying child support consistently, which is a significant responsibility. They haven't ignored the child entirely, as they send birthday gifts. But the lack of contact beyond that might be seen as neglecting the emotional and personal aspects of parenthood. Legally, the author might be fulfilling their obligations, but emotionally and morally, there's a case to be made that the child deserves to know their father if that's what they want.\n\nAnother angle is the initial situation: the author wanted an abortion, but the mother decided against it. That creates a complex scenario where the author didn't want the child from the start. However, once the child is born, the author's responsibility isn't just financial\u2014it's also about being a parent. The lack of involvement could be seen as a failure to take that responsibility seriously.\n\nIn some cultures or legal systems, the father's rights can be challenged if they weren't present. If the author has never sought custody or visitation, the court might consider them an absentee parent. Now, if the mother is trying to involve the father, the author's refusal could be viewed as resisting a potential positive relationship the child might want.\n\nBut the author is clear that they have no interest in being involved. This could be a personal choice, but it's also possible that their stance is causing emotional harm to the child. The child might feel confused or rejected if the father is unwilling to meet them. On the other hand, if the author is mentally unprepared to be a father, forcing them into a relationship might not be healthy for either party.\n\nIn summary, while the author is meeting some legal duties, the moral and emotional aspects of being a parent are where the conflict lies. The decision hinges on whether the author's lack of interest in the child's life is considered a failure to fulfill parental responsibilities, even if they didn't want to be a parent in the first place.\n"
