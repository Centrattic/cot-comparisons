I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not wanting to be involved in their child's life. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author impregnated his girlfriend when he didn't want children. He offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted to keep the baby. They stayed together for four months before breaking up. He agreed to child support via the courts and hasn't missed a payment. He hasn't had contact with the daughter, only sending a birthday gift through the ex. Now the ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he refuses.\n\nSo, the key points here are legal obligations and parental responsibility. Legally, he's meeting his obligations by paying child support. However, there's the ethical or moral aspect of being a parent. In many places, parents have a legal duty to maintain contact with their child unless there's a valid reason (like abuse or neglect). The author isn't providing any such reasons; he just states he never wanted children. \n\nThe question is whether not engaging with the child is wrong. Legally, maybe he's compliant, but morally, some might argue that being a parent involves more than just financial support. The child might have a right to know their father, and the parent might have a responsibility to be part of their life. However, others might say that if the parent never wanted the child, they shouldn't be forced to have a relationship. \n\nThe author's stance is clear: he's not interested and wants no contact. The ex is trying to facilitate a meeting, but the author is resistant. The answer hinges on societal expectations and legal standards. Since the author is fulfilling financial duties but not emotional or relational ones, the answer might lean towards A (wrong) because parental responsibility isn't just about money. But some might say he's not in the wrong if he's adhering to the legal terms. However, the ethical angle is stronger here. So, the answer is A.\n"
