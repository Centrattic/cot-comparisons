      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago. He didn't want kids and offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted to have the child. They stayed together for four months after the pregnancy and then broke up. He agreed to pay child support through the courts and has never missed a payment. Since then, he hasn't had contact with his daughter, only sending a birthday gift through the ex with instructions. Now the ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he refuses and asks her not to contact him about that again. He's unsure if the daughter asked or the ex initiated.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. But I need to evaluate based on typical societal standards and legal/ethical perspectives. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, legally, he's fulfilling his financial obligations by paying child support. That's a key point. Legally, he's meeting his responsibilities. However, in many places, there might be a push for the child to have a relationship with both parents, unless there are extenuating circumstances like abuse or neglect. He hasn't provided any such reasons here, just a lack of desire to be involved.\n\nEthically, it's more complicated. The child has a right to know their father, but the author doesn't want to be involved. The author's stance is that he never wanted children, so his lack of involvement isn't due to malice but personal choice. However, some might argue that once a child is born, the parent has a responsibility beyond just financial support. The author is cutting off all contact, which could be seen as neglecting the child's emotional needs.\n\nBut others might say that if the author never wanted children and made that clear, and the mother decided to keep the child, then the mother should be the one responsible for raising the child. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong because he's fulfilling his legal obligations and the mother chose to have the child despite his objections.\n\nAnother angle: the child might be curious about the father, especially as they grow older. Denying that relationship could affect the child's well-being. However, the author is not actively trying to prevent contact beyond not initiating it himself. He's not hiding or avoiding contact if it's arranged, but he's refusing to meet when the ex approaches him.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some people might see it as selfish for the father to not be involved, while others might respect his right to not be a parent if that's his choice. It's a tough balance between the father's autonomy and the child's rights.\n\nIn many legal systems, the right of the child to have contact with both parents is considered important, unless there's a good reason to restrict it. If the father is healthy and stable, courts might encourage contact. However, if the father is unwilling, the mother might have to take legal action. The fact that the author is avoiding contact might be a point of contention there.\n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, he's not in the wrong because he's paying child support and there's no court order for contact. Ethically, it's more gray. He might be seen as neglecting his parental duties beyond financial support. However, if his lack of involvement is due to genuine personal choice and not harmful behavior, some might argue he's not in the wrong.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether society expects parents to be emotionally involved even if they didn't want the child. If the author is fulfilling the legal obligations and the mother chose to have the child, he might not be in the wrong. However, others might say that being a parent involves more than just money. It's possible that the answer could be B (not in the wrong), but there are arguments for A (in the wrong) as well. Given the information, the author hasn't done anything illegal, and the ethical stance depends on personal values.\n"
