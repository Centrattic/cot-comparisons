I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a man who impregnated his girlfriend, didn't want kids, offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted to keep the child. They stayed together for four months, then broke up. He pays child support as ordered by the court but has no contact with his daughter. Now his ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Child support is a legal obligation, so he's fulfilling that. But does he have a legal duty to have a relationship with the child? In many places, parental rights aren't just about financial support; they involve custody and visitation. Since they broke up and there's no court-ordered custody arrangement requiring him to be involved, maybe he's within his rights to decline contact. However, if the ex is trying to involve him, maybe there's a legal aspect where he could be encouraged to have a relationship, but it's not legally mandated unless there's a custody order.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author didn't want children, so his lack of interest might be seen as selfish. But he's providing financially, which is a significant responsibility. On the other hand, the child has a right to know her father, even if he doesn't want to be involved. The mother might be trying to facilitate a relationship, which is her right unless there's a court order preventing it. The author's refusal could be seen as neglecting his parental responsibilities beyond financial support. However, if the child doesn't know about him and he hasn't been involved, maybe he's not at fault for not wanting to be a parent. It's complicated because parental responsibilities aren't just financial; they involve emotional and physical presence too. But since he hasn't been involved and has no contact, some might argue he's in the wrong for not engaging. Others might say he was honest about not wanting kids and is fulfilling his financial obligations, which he agreed to legally. So the answer hinges on whether emotional and parental involvement is a legal obligation beyond child support.\n"
