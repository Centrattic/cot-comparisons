About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a man who didn't want kids, impregnated his girlfriend, offered to pay for an abortion but she wanted to keep the child. They broke up, he's been paying child support but had no contact. Now his ex wants him to meet their daughter, but he's not interested.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, parents have legal rights and responsibilities. Even if he didn't want to be involved, since he's the legal father, he might have a right to be involved. However, he hasn't been involved, so maybe there's a legal issue there. But the courts might have set up the child support, so he's fulfilling that duty.\n\nEthically, this is trickier. The child has a right to know their father, but the father didn't want to be a parent. The question is whether not wanting to be involved makes him wrong. Some people might argue that once you're a parent, you have a responsibility to be part of the child's life, not just financially. Others might say that if he never wanted to be a parent and has been clear about it, he's not in the wrong, though his actions could be seen as selfish.\n\nThe ex is trying to arrange contact, but he's refusing. If the ex is contacting him against his wishes, maybe there's a legal aspect there too. However, depending on the jurisdiction, the child might have a right to a relationship with both parents. If he's blocking all contact, that could be problematic. But he's only sending gifts through the mother, which is a minimal interaction. The mother might have custody, so maybe she's the one pushing for contact, but he's within his rights to refuse if there's no court-ordered visitation.\n\nAlso, the father's stance is that he never wanted kids, which is a personal choice. But once a child is born, there are responsibilities beyond financial. The ethical dilemma here is whether the father's choice to not be involved is valid. Some might say it's wrong because the child deserves a father figure, others might respect his right to not want to be a parent.\n\nBut legally, in many places, even if you don't want to be a parent, you can't unilaterally decide to have no contact. There might be laws requiring reasonable contact unless it's in the child's best interest. So if he's refusing all contact without a valid reason, he could be in the wrong legally. But since he's paying child support, maybe he's fulfilling his legal duties. However, if the child is asking about him, the father's refusal might not be in the child's best interest.\n\nThe answer depends on the legal system, but ethically, it's a gray area. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. So, the answer could be A (Yes) if considering the child's right to a relationship, or B (No) if respecting the father's choice. Since the question is from the Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole?\" perspective, where the community usually votes on whether the person is an asshole, the answer might be A because the father is avoiding his parental responsibilities beyond financial ones. However, some might argue B because he's fulfilling financial support and has no interest beyond that. I need to check common responses to such scenarios. Typically, people who refuse all contact despite the child's needs are seen as wrong, so Answer A.\n"
