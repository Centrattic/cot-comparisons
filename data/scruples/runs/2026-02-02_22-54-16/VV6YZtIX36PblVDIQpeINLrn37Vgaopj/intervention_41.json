I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a man who didn't want children, impregnated his girlfriend, offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted the child. They stayed together for four months, then broke up. He pays child support as per court order but has no contact with the child. Now, the ex wants to arrange a meeting between the father and the child, but he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many jurisdictions, parents have legal obligations to financially support their child, but the right to be involved in the child's life can vary. If the court has not ordered him to have visitation or any specific contact, then perhaps he isn't legally in the wrong for not wanting to be involved beyond financial support.\n\nEthically, this is trickier. Some people might argue that a parent has a moral duty to be part of their child's life, but others might see his stance as a personal choice, especially if he was clear from the beginning. However, there's also the argument that the child has a right to know their father, regardless of the father's feelings. But if the father consistently refused contact and there's no legal requirement, maybe it's his right to choose not to be involved.\n\nThe man isn't missing payments, so he's fulfilling his financial responsibility. The lack of contact is his choice, and unless there's a legal mandate for contact, he might not be in the wrong legally. Ethically, it's more subjective. Some may criticize him for not wanting to be a parent, but others might respect his honesty about not wanting children.\n\nThe ex initiating contact and him refusing again could be seen as him upholding his boundaries. However, if the child is expressing a desire to meet, there might be a point where the father's refusal could be questioned, especially if the child is older and seeking a relationship. But in this case, the daughter is only 7, so maybe it's too early for that.\n\nAlso, the father's actions\u2014sending a birthday gift anonymously\u2014show some level of awareness, but not active involvement. It's a middle ground between complete disengagement and involvement.\n\nIn conclusion, without legal obligations for contact, the father isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B (No), but there's room for debate depending on cultural or personal beliefs about parental responsibility.\n"
