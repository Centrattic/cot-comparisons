I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a child with their ex, didn't want children, offered to pay for an abortion but she refused. They stayed together four months after the pregnancy was discovered, then broke up. The author has been paying child support but has no contact with the child, only sending a birthday gift through the ex. Now the ex wants them to meet the child, and the author refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, fathers have legal rights and responsibilities regardless of their initial desires. Even if the author didn't want the child, once the child is born, they might have a legal obligation to be involved, depending on local laws. The fact that they've been paying child support shows they fulfill financial responsibilities, but emotional or parental involvement is another matter.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. Parenting isn't just about money; it's about being a role model and providing emotional support. The author hasn't had any contact, which might be harmful to the child's development. Denying the child a relationship with their father could affect their sense of identity and well-being.\n\nThe ex's actions here might be trying to facilitate a relationship between the child and the father. If the child is asking about the father, that's a sign the child might want to know them. The author's refusal could be seen as avoiding responsibility. Even if the author isn't interested, the child's right to know their father is a factor. \n\nHowever, the author might feel they were coerced into parenthood. They didn't want the child, but now are stuck with legal obligations. The question is whether it's ethical to not engage at all. Some might argue that once a child is born, the parent has a duty to be involved, even if they didn't plan for it. Others might understand the author's stance if there's no desire to be a parent, but that doesn't make it right.\n\nChild welfare is key here. Studies show that children benefit from having both parents involved, if possible. The author's complete absence could have negative effects. But the author is paying support, which is a legal minimum. The moral question is higher\u2014should they do more than the minimum?\n\nThe answer likely depends on cultural and personal values. Legally, they might not be in the wrong if they're meeting financial obligations. But ethically, they're neglecting their parental responsibilities beyond money. So the answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong) because they're avoiding parental duties that go beyond financial support, potentially harming the child's well-being.\n"
