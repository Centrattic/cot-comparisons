I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be part of their child's life. The situation is that the author impregnated their ex-girlfriend, didn't want kids, offered to pay for an abortion but she wanted to keep the child. They stayed together for four months after the pregnancy was discovered, then broke up. The author has since paid child support consistently but has had no contact with the child except sending a birthday gift through the mother. Now the ex wants the author to meet the daughter, but the author is refusing.\n\nHmm. Legally, in many places, parents have rights and responsibilities. Even if the father didn't want the child initially, once the child is born, he has a legal obligation to support them. But in terms of parental rights, if he didn't pursue custody or visitation, maybe he's allowed to opt out. But does that make it morally wrong? \n\nThe author hasn't shown any interest in the child's life beyond financial support. The ex is trying to facilitate a meeting, but the author is refusing. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, he's fulfilling his duty by paying child support. But morally, is it wrong to not want any relationship with the child? Some people might argue that a child has a right to know their parent. Others might say that if the parent didn't want the child, they shouldn't be forced to have a relationship. But the author did father a child, so there's an argument that he has a responsibility beyond just money. \n\nThe ex might be trying to give the child a relationship with her father. The author's refusal could be seen as denying the child that. But the author might feel that he never wanted children and doesn't want to be involved. \n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. Legally, he's not in the wrong. Morally, it's debatable. However, in terms of societal expectations, many would say that a parent has a duty to be involved in their child's life beyond just financial support. So maybe the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong. But I'm not sure. Some might say it's his right to not want to be involved. \n\nBut the key here is that the author is denying the child a potential relationship with their father. Even if the author didn't want the child, once the child exists, the parent has a responsibility towards them. So in that sense, the author is in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
