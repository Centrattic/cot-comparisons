I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who didn't want kids, impregnated his girlfriend, offered an abortion but she wanted the child. They broke up after four months, and he's been paying child support but has no contact. Now the ex wants him to meet their daughter, and he refuses.\n\nHmm. First, the law part. In many places, parents have legal obligations to provide financial support regardless of their involvement. So he's not wrong legally for not being present if he's paying. But morally? It's more complicated. The child has a right to know both parents, but the father isn't interested. \n\nThe father's stance is that he never wanted kids, so he's not interested in a relationship. That's his personal choice, but some might argue that once a child is born, the parent has a responsibility beyond just money. However, he hasn't forced his presence, which could be seen as the mother's role to facilitate contact if she wants. \n\nThe ex wants to meet, and he's refusing. If the mother is trying to push for contact, maybe the father's right to refuse. But if the child is asking about him, there might be a different dynamic. The father's argument is he's not involved, but he's providing financially. \n\nSo, in terms of legal and moral obligations, he might not be in the wrong. The answer could be B. But I need to check if there's any legal requirement for contact beyond support. In some jurisdictions, there might be, but generally, it's just financial. So the answer is probably B.\n"
