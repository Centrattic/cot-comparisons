I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The user is asking if the author, who hasn't wanted any part in their child's life, is at fault.\n\nFirst, the situation: He impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago, didn't want kids, offered an abortion which she declined. They broke up after four months. He's been paying child support without fail but has had no contact. Now his ex wants him to meet their daughter, and he's refusing.\n\nSo, the main question is about parental responsibility. Even if he didn't want children, once a child is born, does he have a duty to be involved? Legally, he's meeting his obligation by paying child support, which he's done consistently. But emotionally or morally, maybe there's more expected. \n\nIn many places, fathers do have rights and responsibilities, so maybe there's an expectation to have some relationship with the child, even if he didn't plan for it. But he's been clear from the start that he doesn't want any part in the child's life beyond financial support. The ex is now trying to arrange a meeting, which he's resisting. \n\nThe answer depends on cultural or societal norms. Some might say he's wrong for not wanting to be involved, as the child has a right to know their parent. Others might argue that he made his stance clear and is fulfilling his legal duties, so he's not in the wrong. Also, the fact that he sent a birthday gift anonymously might be a tiny gesture, but not a relationship. \n\nBut the key points are: he's not engaging beyond payments, the ex is trying to connect him with the child, and he's refusing. Legally, he's compliant, but morally, there's a debate. However, depending on the jurisdiction, fathers might have some rights to refuse contact if they don't want it, especially if there's no court order for visitation. But if the ex is trying to push for contact, and he's blocking that, there might be legal implications if the court previously ordered some contact. \n\nSince the story says they got a court settlement for child support, but no mention of visitation rights, maybe he isn't legally obligated to have contact. So, legally he's not in the wrong. Morally, it's a gray area. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong) if we're focusing on legal and the facts presented. However, if the question is based on societal expectations, it's more complicated. But the user is asking if he's in the wrong based on the situation described. Given the information, he's met his legal responsibilities, so the answer might be B.\n"
