I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts.

About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong regarding not wanting to be part of their child's life. The situation is that they accidentally impregnated their girlfriend, didn't want kids, offered an abortion which she refused, then after a breakup, they've been paying child support but have no contact. Now the ex is trying to arrange a meeting, and the author refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, having a legal obligation to pay child support doesn't automatically give a parent the right to have contact. But if the child is of a certain age, maybe their wishes are considered. However, the author hasn't had any contact, which might be a problem if the child is old enough to want to know the father. But the author hasn't been involved at all, just sending a gift anonymously. \n\nEthically, this is tricky. The author is providing financially but not emotionally. The child has a right to know both parents if possible, but the author clearly doesn't want any relationship. The ex might be trying to facilitate this for the child's sake. \n\nLegally, the author might not be forced to have contact if a court hasn't ordered it. But in some jurisdictions, if the parent is willing and the child is old enough, the court might encourage contact. However, the author isn't being forced here; they're refusing when approached. \n\nThe author's stance is that they never wanted kids and aren't interested. But the child is a result of their actions, and while they have the right to refuse contact, it could affect the child's well-being. The question is whether refusing contact is morally wrong even if legally permissible. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the ex contacting the author. If the author isn't a legal guardian, maybe the ex has the right to decide who the child meets. But if the author is a legal parent, maybe there's a right to be involved. However, the author hasn't been involved at all, so maybe the ex is acting in the child's best interest.\n\nIn terms of answer, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Legally, maybe not, but morally or ethically, there could be an argument. However, the answer options are A for yes (wrong) and B for no. The answer would depend on the jurisdiction and specific laws, but generally, if the author isn't legally obligated to have contact, they might not be in the wrong. But if the child is old enough and the author is refusing contact, some might say they have a moral obligation. \n\nBut in the scenario, the author hasn't had contact and just sends an anonymous gift. Maybe the ex is trying to involve the author now, but the author is refusing. If the author was never involved, is it wrong to refuse now? It's possible the author is in the wrong because they are avoiding responsibility beyond financial. However, the answer might depend on local laws and the child's age. Since the daughter is 7 now, maybe she's starting to understand family and might want to know her father. The author's refusal might be seen as neglecting the child's needs. \n\nBut without a court order requiring contact, the author might not be in the wrong legally. However, morally, many would argue they should try to have some relationship. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A or B. Given the information, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) if considering legal rights, but if considering moral obligation, A. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not just legal. The user is likely expecting to weigh both legal and moral aspects. However, in the absence of legal obligation beyond child support, and if the author is fulfilling that, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, the act of refusing contact entirely despite the child's existence might be seen as wrong morally. But the answer is to choose A or B. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, a parent can disengage from a child's life without being in the wrong, as long as they provide financially. But if the child is in a position to want to know the father, maybe the author is in the wrong. Since the child is 7, maybe she's old enough to be curious. The author's refusal could be impacting her. But the answer depends on the community's perspective. In many cases, people might say the author is in the wrong for not wanting any contact. So the answer could be A. But I'm a bit torn here. The answer could be A if the author is morally wrong, but B if legally not in the wrong. The question is phrased as \"in the wrong,\" which is a moral judgment rather than legal. So the answer might be A. But the user might be looking for a legal perspective. Hmm. The initial question is whether the author is in the wrong, which is a moral question. So considering that, the answer is likely A because they are avoiding parental responsibilities beyond just financial. Hence, the answer is A.\n"
