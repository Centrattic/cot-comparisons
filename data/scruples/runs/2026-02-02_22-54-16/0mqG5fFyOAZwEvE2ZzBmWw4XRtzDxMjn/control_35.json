A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about sneaking into a partner's phone and finding out they're cheating. The author left a note and left before confronting the partner. The boyfriend was upset about the invasion of privacy, even though he was cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Snooping is generally considered a breach of trust, even if the outcome is that the person is cheating. Trust is a two-way street in a relationship. If one partner is unfaithful, that's a violation of the relationship's commitments. However, the act of snooping without consent is also a privacy issue. \n\nThe author mentions that they have friends who snoop for no reason, which they're against, but in this case, they felt it was justified because of the cheating. But the problem here is that the author decided to take matters into their own hands instead of discussing concerns openly. Open communication is usually the healthier approach, even if it's uncomfortable.\n\nThe boyfriend was upset about the privacy invasion, even though he was cheating. That shows that both parties have issues. The author might argue that they saved future heartbreak, but the method of finding out through snooping might have caused immediate emotional harm. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If one person has doubts, they should talk about them instead of resorting to snooping. So, even though the cheating is wrong, the act of snooping is also a breach of trust. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they violated their partner's privacy, regardless of the outcome. The right approach would have been to address the issues directly and communicate, even if it's painful. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
