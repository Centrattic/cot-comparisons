A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The answer should be either A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The author's boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned a depressive hole. The author couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong and decided to snoop his phone while he was asleep. They found out he was cheating, left a note, and he yelled at her for invading his privacy, saying it shows lack of trust.\n\nThe author justifies their actions by saying they saved themselves from future heartbreak and aren't pro-snooping unless something's really wrong. They mention friends who snoop out of nosiness, which they are against, but in this case, they felt it was necessary due to their gut feeling and the cheating.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a general relationship ethics perspective, snooping without consent is usually considered a violation of privacy. Even if there are suspicions, checking someone's phone without permission is a breach of trust. The boyfriend's reaction highlights the importance of trust in a relationship. However, the author's intention was to uncover infidelity, which is a serious issue. \n\nBut the key point here is the method used. While the outcome revealed a betrayal, the act of snooping itself is ethically questionable. Trust is a fundamental part of any relationship, and breaking that trust by secretly checking the phone, even with a justified suspicion, can be seen as wrong. The author's actions led to the truth, but it's about whether the means were appropriate. \n\nIn many cases, experts would say that while the cheating is on the boyfriend, the act of snooping is still a privacy violation. The author's defense that they wanted to avoid future heartbreak doesn't absolve the action of being wrong, even if it was motivated by self-preservation. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because snooping without consent is a breach of privacy and trust, regardless of the outcome. However, some might argue that the context of suspected cheating makes it a gray area. But traditionally, the action itself is considered wrong, even if it leads to a negative outcome.\n"
