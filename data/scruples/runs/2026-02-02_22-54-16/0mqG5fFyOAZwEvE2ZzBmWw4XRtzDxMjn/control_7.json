A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The options are A for yes and B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author's boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned he was in a depressive hole. The author's gut feeling led them to snoop, finding evidence of an affair. They left a note and left, then the boyfriend yelled at them for invading his privacy and lack of trust.\n\nThe author justifies their actions by distinguishing between snooping out of concern versus nosiness. They argue that they saved themselves future heartbreak. The key points here are privacy, trust, and the justification for the action.\n\nIn terms of ethics, privacy is a significant factor. Even if there are suspicions, going through someone's phone without consent is generally considered a violation of trust. However, the author had a valid reason based on their partner's behavior. The boyfriend's reaction about distrust might be valid, but the author felt they had no other way to uncover the truth.\n\nLegally, there might not be a clear right or wrong here, but socially, snooping is often frowned upon unless there's a compelling reason. The author believes their actions were justified because they ended up finding infidelity. However, the method of discovery (snooping) could have damaged the relationship's trust even before the infidelity was known.\n\nThe debate hinges on whether the ends justify the means. The author saved themselves from continued heartbreak, but at the cost of violating privacy. Different perspectives would weigh these factors differently. Some might argue that trust should be given even when there's suspicion, while others might agree that knowing the truth is better than staying in a deceitful relationship.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the action was invasive and could have been avoided with communication. On the other, it led to an honest outcome and prevented future pain. The author's stance is that it was necessary, but others might see it as a breach of trust regardless of the outcome. \n\nSo, based on the arguments presented, the answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs. However, since the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong, the common societal view often sides with AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenarios where such actions are seen as the person's fault. The boyfriend felt betrayed by the snooping, which could indicate the author was at fault, even if the outcome was negative for the partner.\n"
