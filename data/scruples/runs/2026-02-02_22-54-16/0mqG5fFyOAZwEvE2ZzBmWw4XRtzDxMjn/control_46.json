A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that they snooped through their boyfriend's phone and found out he was cheating. They left a note and left, and he got angry, saying they didn't trust him. The author defends their actions by saying they had a gut feeling something was wrong and that they saved themselves heartbreak.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethics of snooping. Privacy is important in relationships, even if one partner suspects something. Trust is a big part of any relationship, so violating that trust by checking someone's phone without permission could be seen as wrong, regardless of the outcome. But on the other hand, the author mentions they had a legitimate reason\u2014feeling something was off and the boyfriend was being distant. They also differentiate between snooping out of no reason and doing it when there's a real concern.\n\nHowever, the act of sneaking into someone's phone is a breach of privacy. Even if the intention was to uncover the truth, the method might be considered unethical. The boyfriend felt betrayed because of the lack of trust, which is a valid feeling. The author might argue that the consequences (finding out about the cheating) justify the means, but some might still say that the wrong action was taken regardless of the outcome.\n\nAnother point is whether the author handled the situation appropriately. Instead of confronting the boyfriend directly, they left a note. Maybe a direct confrontation could have been better, but the author might have been too upset. Also, the boyfriend's reaction was harsh, calling them a piece of shit, which isn't acceptable. But the author's action still involved invasion of privacy.\n\nI need to weigh the ethical aspects here. Privacy violations are generally frowned upon, even if the intent is to uncover infidelity. Trust is supposed to be the foundation, and without it, the relationship is already in trouble. The author might have acted out of self-preservation, but the method could be debated. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards yes because invading privacy is a breach, even with good intentions. However, others might see it as justified given the outcome. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about privacy versus self-protection.\n"
