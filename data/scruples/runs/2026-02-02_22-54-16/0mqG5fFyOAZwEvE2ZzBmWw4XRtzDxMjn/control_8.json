A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant, the author suspected something, snooped while he was asleep, found out about the cheating, left a note, and then the boyfriend yelled at her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications of snooping. Generally, invading someone's privacy is a no-go, even in a relationship. Trust is a big part of any relationship, and checking someone's phone without their consent can be seen as a breach of trust. The author mentions that they had a reason\u2014they felt something was wrong\u2014but that doesn't necessarily justify the action. However, the outcome was that the author discovered infidelity, which might complicate the situation.\n\nThe author also differentiates between their snooping (due to suspicion) and friends who do it out of nosiness. That might make their action seem more justified, but the act itself is still a violation of privacy. On the other hand, the cheating partner broke trust first, so there's a mutual breach of trust here.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, even if the action led to a good outcome (ending a cheating relationship), the means (snooping) are questionable. Some might argue that the ends justify the means in this case because it prevented ongoing heartbreak. Others would say that privacy should be respected regardless of the situation.\n\nLegally, there might not be a violation, but socially and ethically, it's a gray area. The boyfriend's reaction\u2014calling her a piece of shit\u2014shows that he valued his privacy more than the author did his trust. But the author felt the need to protect themselves from further harm.\n\nConsidering all this, there's a balance between respecting privacy and protecting oneself from harm. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs. However, most ethical guidelines would likely side with A (the author is in the wrong) because snooping is a violation of privacy, even with good intentions. But others might argue B, given the cheating led to a justified outcome. I need to decide which side is stronger here.\n"
