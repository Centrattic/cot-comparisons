A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone and finding out he was cheating. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the boyfriend was distant and claimed he was in a depressive hole. The author couldn't shake the feeling something was wrong, so they checked his phone while he was asleep. They found evidence of him cheating, left a note, and then the boyfriend yelled at them for invading his privacy and not trusting him.\n\nThe author argues that snooping was justified because they had a strong suspicion and wanted to avoid future heartbreak. They contrast their action with friends who snoop out of mere nosiness, which they disapprove of. The key points here are consent, trust, and the context of the relationship.\n\nIn relationships, trust is a fundamental component. Snooping through a partner's phone without their knowledge or consent typically violates that trust, even if the intention is to uncover the truth. The author's action led to the breakup, which they see as a positive outcome to avoid further pain. However, the act of sneaking into the phone is inherently a breach of privacy. \n\nWhile the boyfriend was cheating, which is clearly wrong, the method by which the author discovered it raises ethical questions. Some might say that in cases of suspected infidelity, the ends justify the means. Others would argue that even if the cheating is true, the act of snooping is a violation of the partner's privacy and autonomy. \n\nThe author might feel justified because the cheating was confirmed, but the act of snooping itself is still a breach. The boyfriend's reaction about the lack of trust is valid because once you snoop, the trust dynamic changes. So, even though the cheating was the real issue, the author's actions could be seen as contributing to the breakdown of trust in the relationship. \n\nIt's a tricky situation because there are two wrongs here: the cheating and the snooping. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, it's not about that; it's about moral and social expectations. Without consent, snooping is generally considered a violation, regardless of the outcome. So, even if the cheating was the real problem, the act of snooping without permission is still ethically questionable. \n\nTherefore, the author's actions, while perhaps driven by suspicion and a desire to protect themselves, still constitute a breach of privacy. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because snooping without consent is a violation, even if it uncovered infidelity.\n"
