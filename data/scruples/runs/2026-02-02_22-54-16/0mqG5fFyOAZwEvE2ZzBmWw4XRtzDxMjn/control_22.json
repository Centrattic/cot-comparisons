A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant, the author suspected something and found out he was cheating. They left a note and left, and he got angry about the privacy invasion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Snooping without permission is generally a violation of privacy. Even if the reason is suspicion of cheating, it's still a breach of trust. The partner might have had valid reasons for being distant that aren't cheating, so the author acted on their own assumptions. \n\nBut then, the author also points out that they're not doing it just out of nosiness, but because they felt something was really wrong. They argue that they saved themselves future heartbreak. There's a balance between respecting privacy and protecting oneself from potential harm.\n\nOn one hand, cheating is a serious issue, and the author might not have known unless they checked. On the other hand, trust is a fundamental part of a relationship. If the author didn't trust their partner enough to communicate openly, maybe the relationship had issues regardless.\n\nAlso, the author's friends snoop for no reason, but the author differentiates their own actions as necessary. However, the act itself is still snooping, which could be seen as wrong regardless of intent. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also a factor. He felt betrayed by the invasion of privacy, which is a valid feeling. Even if he was cheating, the method of discovering it mattered to both parties. The author might be in the wrong for not trusting their partner and confronting the issue through snooping instead of communication.\n\nIn many cases, relationships require trust. If the author couldn't trust their partner without checking, maybe the relationship wasn't healthy. But the act of snooping is ethically questionable. So, the answer might be A (author is at fault) because they violated privacy, even if the outcome was revealing cheating. The right approach might have been to communicate first or seek help before resorting to snooping.\n"
