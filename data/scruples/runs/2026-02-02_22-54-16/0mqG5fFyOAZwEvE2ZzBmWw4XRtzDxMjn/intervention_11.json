A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a person who snooped through their boyfriend's phone and found out he was cheating. The question is whether they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Snooping into someone's phone without their consent is generally considered a violation of privacy. That's a key point. Even if there were suspicions of cheating, going through the phone without asking might be seen as a breach of trust. The author mentions that they didn't trust their gut feeling and acted on it, but trust is a two-way street in a relationship. By snooping, they might have broken the trust that the relationship was built on.\n\nOn the other hand, the author argues that they were justified because they discovered the infidelity. They didn't confront the boyfriend immediately but left a note, which shows they tried to handle it respectfully. The boyfriend's reaction was to yell and blame them for the lack of trust. However, the boyfriend was already cheating, which is a betrayal in itself. \n\nI also need to think about societal norms and relationship expectations. Some people might say that if you're in a committed relationship, you should be open and honest, and if one partner isn't, the other has a right to know. But the method of finding out (snooping) is still a problem. Trust and communication are supposed to be the foundations of a relationship. If the boyfriend wasn't being honest, the author might feel betrayed even before the cheating was discovered.\n\nAnother angle is the consequences. The author left the relationship, possibly avoiding further heartbreak. The boyfriend's cheating was the main issue, not necessarily the snooping. But the act of snooping could have been avoided if the author had confronted the boyfriend about their concerns first. Maybe a conversation could have happened without invading privacy.\n\nThe author also differentiates between their situation and friends who snoop out of no reason, which shows they acknowledge that context matters. However, even with bad intentions, snooping is a common reaction for some people, but that doesn't justify it morally.\n\nSo, weighing these points: snooping is a privacy violation, but the cheating was the root problem. The author's actions led to them ending the relationship, which they might have needed to do. But the method of finding out involved breaking trust. It's a bit of a gray area. Some might say the ends justify the means, others might say the means were wrong regardless of the outcome.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether violating privacy to uncover cheating is justified. Since cheating is a betrayal, but so is snooping. It's a tough call. But in terms of right and wrong, the act of snooping without consent is generally considered wrong, even if it leads to a justified outcome. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the breach of privacy, despite the good intentions.\n"
