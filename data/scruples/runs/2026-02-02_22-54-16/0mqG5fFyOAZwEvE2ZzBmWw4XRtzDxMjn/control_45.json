A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about snooping through a partner's phone and finding out about an affair. The author defends their actions by saying they had a gut feeling something was wrong and that they wanted to avoid future heartbreak.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of snooping. Generally, privacy is a big deal. Trust in a relationship is fundamental. If you snoop without permission, even if you have suspicions, it's invading someone's privacy. The author mentions their boyfriend was acting distant, but he shared he was in a depressive hole. The author didn't approach him directly to discuss the concerns but instead snooped while he was asleep. That seems like a breach of trust.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was to yell and call the author a piece of shit. That's harsh, but maybe he felt betrayed because of the invasion of privacy. The author says they're against snooping for no reason but in this case, they did it for a reason. However, the method of confronting the issue was through snooping instead of honest communication.\n\nOn the other hand, the author found out the truth and ended the relationship quickly. They argue they saved themselves future heartbreak. But relationships should be built on trust, and if trust is broken by snooping, even if the suspicions were right, it's still a problem.\n\nSo, the key points are: invasion of privacy, breach of trust, and the method of resolving the issue. Even though the outcome was uncovering a cheating partner, the means used were unethical. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
