A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who snoop on their partner is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant, and the person checked his phone while he slept, found out he was cheating, left him, and he yelled at her for invading his privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects of snooping. Generally, privacy is important in relationships, and checking someone's phone without consent is usually seen as a breach of trust. However, the person here had a reason to suspect something was wrong, not just out of nosiness. They mention friends who snoop out of curiosity, but they did it because they felt something was off. \n\nBut even with a reason, invading someone's privacy can be problematic. The boyfriend was upset because it felt like a lack of trust. Trust is a cornerstone in relationships, and snooping can damage that. However, the person argues that they saved themselves future heartbreak by finding out the truth early. \n\nThere's a balance between trust and transparency. If the boyfriend was really unfaithful, maybe he should have been honest. But the act of snooping might have been a last resort after his behavior didn't improve. However, the ethical question is whether the means justify the end. Even if the result was good (finding out the cheating), the method of invading privacy might still be considered wrong. \n\nAlso, the person left a note and didn't confront him immediately, which shows some consideration, but the fact remains that they didn't respect his privacy. Different people have different views on privacy; some might see it as justified, others not. Legally, snooping isn't a crime, but ethically, it's debatable. \n\nIn conclusion, while the person had a reason, the act of snooping without consent is generally considered wrong because it breaches trust. So the answer would be A, but there's nuance here. However, the question asks if the author is in the wrong, and the options are A or B. Based on typical ethical standards, the answer is A.\n"
