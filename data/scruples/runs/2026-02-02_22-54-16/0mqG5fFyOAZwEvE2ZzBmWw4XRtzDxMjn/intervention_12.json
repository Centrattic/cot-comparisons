A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The dilemma here is about privacy versus trust in a relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's boyfriend was acting distant and admitted to being in a depressive hole. The author felt something was off and decided to check his phone, finding out he was cheating. They left a note and left without confronting him directly. The boyfriend then yelled at her for invading his privacy and said it shows she didn't trust him.\n\nThe author argues that they snoop because they had a strong feeling something was wrong, not just out of nosiness. They believe they saved themselves future heartbreak. On the other hand, snooping can be seen as a violation of privacy, which is a significant issue in relationships. Trust is a two-way street; even if one partner suspects something, checking without communication might erode trust further.\n\nBut the context matters. The author wasn't just randomly snooping for fun. They had a legitimate concern based on the boyfriend's behavior and his vague explanation. The boyfriend's cheating is the wrong here, but the method of discovery is under scrutiny. Some might say that trust should be maintained even in difficult times, and confronting the issue directly rather than snooping is better. Others might see the author's actions as justified given the infidelity.\n\nEthically, privacy is a personal right. However, relationships also involve mutual trust and transparency. If the boyfriend was cheating, it's a betrayal regardless. The question is about the author's wrongness. Since the primary issue is the boyfriend's infidelity, the author's snooping could be seen as a last resort to uncover the truth. But invading privacy is generally frowned upon, even with good intentions.\n\nThe author did leave a note and didn't confront him immediately, which might be more considerate. Still, the act of snooping itself is a breach. However, given the outcome, some might argue it was necessary to reveal the cheating. It's a gray area. The answer might depend on cultural or personal views on privacy versus relationship trust.\n"
