A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for snooping through their boyfriend's phone. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant, and the person, after some suspicion, checked his phone while he was asleep and found out he was cheating. They left a note and left, and the boyfriend was upset about the privacy invasion.\n\nThe person argues that they weren't just being nosy but had a reason\u2014there was a gut feeling that something was wrong. They also mention friends who snoop for no reason, distinguishing their action from that. They believe their snooping saved them from future heartbreak.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle here. Privacy is important in relationships. Even if there's suspicion, going through someone's phone without their consent is a breach of trust. But then again, the person felt they had a valid reason because they noticed the boyfriend was acting off and later found evidence of cheating.\n\nThe key points here are consent and trust. The boyfriend accused them of not trusting him, which is a common argument in situations like this. On one hand, snooping is a violation of privacy. On the other, if the other person is being unfaithful, the person might feel justified in their actions to uncover the truth.\n\nBut from a relationship standpoint, trust is foundational. If one partner feels the need to snoop, that could indicate underlying issues in the relationship. However, the author did act out of a sense of self-preservation and to avoid future pain. The question is whether the means (snooping) were justified by the ends (discovering infidelity).\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, the right to privacy is considered a fundamental right. Even if the intention was good, the method of intruding into someone's private space without consent is problematic. However, some might argue that in cases of suspected betrayal, the harm caused by ignorance could be worse than the harm of the snooping itself.\n\nIt's also important to consider the legal aspect, but since the user is asking about being \"in the wrong\" morally rather than legally, the focus is on ethics. Different people might have different views here. Some might say the person has a right to know and acted to protect themselves, while others might emphasize that the snooping was a violation and that open communication should be sought first.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they were saving themselves from future pain, which is a valid self-preservation instinct. However, the act of snooping could be seen as taking a shortcut to the truth without giving the other person a chance to explain their behavior. If the boyfriend was indeed cheating, then the author's action uncovered the truth, but it's possible that even with cheating, the way to handle it should be through confrontation rather than covert investigation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might be understandable, the act of snooping itself is ethically questionable. It's a complex situation where both perspectives have merit. However, since the user is asking for a yes or no answer (A or B), I need to decide based on the balance of these factors. The answer might depend on cultural norms, personal ethics, and the specific context. Given the information, the author acted out of concern but violated trust. So, in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's a gray area, but the consensus might lean towards A (yes, they're in the wrong) because of the privacy violation, but others might side with B (not in the wrong) due to the justified outcome. I need to consider which is more weighty.\n"
