A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The author argues that they had a legitimate reason because they sensed something was off and found out their partner was cheating. They also mention that they left a note and didn't confront him immediately, and that they're against casual snooping for no reason.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Snooping into someone's phone is generally considered a violation of privacy, regardless of the relationship. Trust is a big part of any relationship, and invading someone's privacy without permission can be seen as a breach of trust. But the author felt that their actions were justified because they discovered infidelity, which is a serious issue.\n\nHowever, the key point here is whether the means (snooping) were justified by the ends (finding out about the cheating). Even if the outcome was that the author discovered the cheating, the act of snooping itself can be problematic. Relationships should ideally be built on mutual trust and communication. If the partner was acting distant, maybe the right approach would have been to have an open conversation instead of invading privacy. \n\nAlso, the author's partner was upset about the privacy violation, which indicates that the act hurt the relationship. The author's justification is that they saved themselves future heartbreak, but breaking someone's privacy can lead to immediate relationship damage. It's a bit of a catch-22. \n\nBut then again, cheating is a significant betrayal. The author might have legitimate reasons to be upset and want to protect themselves. The question is whether the method used was wrong. Legally, it's not illegal to snoop through a partner's phone if they live together, but ethically, it's a gray area. \n\nI think there's a balance here. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because they acted out of concern for their own well-being and discovered a betrayal. But the method of using snooping is ethically questionable. It's possible to argue both sides. However, the general consensus might lean towards AITA (Am I the Asshole) categories where snooping is considered a mistake unless there's a clear and present danger. \n\nGiven that the author had a valid reason and the cheating was confirmed, maybe they're in the right. But if the cheating wasn't confirmed and it was just a suspicion, then snooping would be wrong. Here, the cheating was confirmed, so maybe it's understandable. But the fact remains that privacy was invaded. \n\nIn some relationships, partners might agree to check each other's phones, but in this case, it was unilateral. The partner's reaction also shows that the action crossed a line. So perhaps the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because snooping is a violation of trust and privacy, even if the outcome was the discovery of cheating. The means, regardless of the ends, might still be considered wrong in an ethical sense.\n"
