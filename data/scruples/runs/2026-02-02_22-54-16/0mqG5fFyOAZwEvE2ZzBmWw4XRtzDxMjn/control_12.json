A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant, and upon snooping, the author found out he was cheating. The author left a note and left, then the boyfriend was angry about the invasion of privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Snooping through someone's phone without their consent is generally considered a violation of privacy. Even if the intention was to uncover infidelity, the method used is questionable. Trust is a cornerstone in relationships, and breaking that trust by snooping can have serious consequences. \n\nThe author mentions they had a gut feeling something was wrong and it wasn't just out of nosiness. They also differentiate themselves from friends who snoop without reason. However, regardless of the reason, invading someone's privacy without consent is a breach. The boyfriend's reaction about feeling untrusted is valid because trust issues can lead to relationship problems. \n\nOn the other hand, the author argues that they saved themselves future heartbreak by discovering the cheating early. While that's a valid point, the method might have caused additional hurt. Instead of confronting the issue directly, which might have led to a conversation and potential resolution, the immediate decision to leave and not face the situation together could be seen as abrupt. \n\nBut the core issue here is the act of snooping itself. Even if the outcome was beneficial for the author, the action is ethically problematic. Privacy violations are generally not justified, even if the outcome is favorable. There might have been other ways to address the relationship issues, like open communication or seeking counseling. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the act of snooping is a breach of trust and privacy, which makes the author at fault. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
