A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about snooping through a partner's phone, finding out about infidelity, and then leaving a note before leaving the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key elements. The author's boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned being in a depressive hole. The author, based on a gut feeling, snooped his phone while he was asleep and found evidence of him cheating. The author then left a note and left, leading to the boyfriend's anger over the privacy invasion.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn relationships, trust is a big factor. Snooping without consent is generally considered a breach of trust. Even if the author had a suspicion, intruding on someone's privacy is a violation. The boyfriend's reaction was anger about the privacy invasion, not just the cheating. However, the cheating itself is a separate issue. \n\nThe author justifies their actions by saying they wanted to avoid future heartbreak and that they're against snooping without a reason. But the act of snooping itself is still a violation regardless of the outcome. Even though the author found the truth, the method used is problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, the cheating is a betrayal, so the author's decision to leave makes sense. But the question is about being in the wrong. The author's action (snooping) is ethically questionable because it involves privacy invasion. Even if the result was good, the means could be bad. \n\nIn many situations, people argue that invading privacy is wrong, even if the reason is suspicion of cheating. The boyfriend's anger is about the privacy breach, which the author admits to. The author might have been hurt, but the act of snooping could be seen as the wrong move. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author's intention to protect themselves from further harm is understandable. But the method is still a violation. So, the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong for snooping, but the context of the cheating complicates it. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not if the situation is justified. \n\nIn typical AITA scenarios, snooping is often considered wrong because it's a breach of trust. So the answer is likely A.\n"
