A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again. The author is a partner who suspected their boyfriend was acting distant. The boyfriend mentioned he was in a depressive hole, but the author couldn't shake the feeling something was wrong. They snooped through his phone while he was asleep and found out he was cheating. The author left a note and left, and then the boyfriend yelled at her, saying she invaded his privacy and that it proves she didn't trust him.\n\nThe author justifies their actions by saying they did it because they had a strong feeling something was really wrong, not just out of nosiness. They mention friends who snoop for no reason, but they're against that. The author feels they did the right thing because they avoided future heartbreak by finding out early.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer is either A or B. I need to determine that based on common perspectives on relationships and trust.\n\nIn many relationships, privacy is considered important. Snooping through someone's phone without permission is generally seen as a violation of trust. Even if the person had suspicions, breaking into the phone is a breach of privacy. The boyfriend's reaction about not being trusted makes sense from his perspective because the action itself (snooping) implies a lack of trust, regardless of the outcome.\n\nHowever, the author's intention was to uncover something serious (cheating) that was causing distance. The outcome was that they found out the truth and ended the relationship quickly. Some might argue that the ends justify the means here because it saved the author from ongoing pain. Others might say that trust is foundational in a relationship, and without mutual trust, the relationship is already in trouble. The act of snooping, even if it leads to the truth, can be seen as a breach that's hard to recover from.\n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. Instead of snooping, the author could have tried to address the distance more directly, perhaps involving a conversation about the concerns or seeking couples' counseling. That way, the trust issue might be addressed without violating privacy.\n\nBut then again, the boyfriend was already distant and potentially lying about his emotional state. If the author felt that the relationship was on the brink and there was no other way to get the truth, some might empathize with the decision. However, the ethical standpoint usually prioritizes respecting each other's privacy, regardless of the situation.\n\nIn many cultures and relationship advice, snooping is discouraged. It's seen as a way to avoid confronting issues or as a lack of trust. The author's friends snooping for no reason are different, but even in this case, the action is still considered by many as wrong, even if it led to a positive outcome for the author.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's action, while leading to a good outcome for them, involved a violation of privacy and trust. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong from the boyfriend's perspective and from a general ethical standpoint. However, some might argue that the context (potential cheating and distance) makes it understandable. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not just whether it's understandable.\n\nGiven that the boyfriend was cheating, the author's action was in response to that, but the act of snooping itself is still a breach. Therefore, the author is in the wrong in terms of violating trust and privacy, even if it led to the truth. So the answer would be A.\n"
