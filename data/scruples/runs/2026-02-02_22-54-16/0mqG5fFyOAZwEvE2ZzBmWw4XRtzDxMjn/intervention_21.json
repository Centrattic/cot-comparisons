A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. They provided the scenario where the boyfriend was acting distant, and after snooping, the author found out he was cheating. The boyfriend then yelled at her for invading his privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Snooping is generally considered a breach of privacy, even in a relationship. Trust is a fundamental part of any partnership, so invading someone's privacy, like checking their phone without consent, can be seen as a violation of that trust. The author's actions might be justified if there was a valid reason, like suspected cheating, but that doesn't necessarily make it right.\n\nThen there's the legal angle. In many places, looking through a partner's phone without their permission could be illegal, as it might involve accessing private information without consent. Even if it's a romantic partner, the law typically treats it as a privacy violation. But since the question is about being in the wrong, not necessarily breaking the law, maybe that's less relevant here.\n\nThe author mentions they did this because they had a gut feeling something was wrong, not out of mere nosiness. They also note that they found evidence of cheating, which could be a reason to end the relationship. However, the act of snooping itself is problematic. Relationships should be built on mutual trust and transparency. If there's a suspicion of infidelity, the right approach would be to have an open conversation rather than secretly checking the phone.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also important. He felt betrayed because of the privacy invasion, even though he was cheating. The author's reasoning is that they saved themselves future heartbreak, but the method used could have long-term repercussions on trust and respect. Some might argue that the ends justify the means, but others would say that using deceit undermines the relationship's integrity.\n\nI should also think about the cultural and personal values involved. Some people might believe that in cases of infidelity, the discovery justifies the snooping, while others might prioritize respecting privacy regardless of the outcome. The author's own stance is against casual snooping, which shows they understand the general wrongness but still felt it was necessary here.\n\nIn conclusion, while the outcome might have been a good one (ending a cheating relationship), the act of snooping is ethically and morally questionable. Privacy is a right, and even in close relationships, it's important to respect it. The correct answer here would likely be A, the author is in the wrong for violating their partner's privacy, even if the reason was to uncover infidelity.\n"
