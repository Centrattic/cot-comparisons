A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The scenario is that the boyfriend was acting distant and had a depressive episode, but the author suspected something was off. They snooped and found out he was cheating. Now, the boyfriend is upset about the privacy invasion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Snooping generally invades privacy, which is a big no-no in relationships. Trust is essential, and invading someone's privacy, even with suspicion, can be seen as a breach of that trust. The author might argue they were protecting themselves from future heartbreak, but the method is questionable.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't just being nosy. They had a valid reason\u2014suspecting infidelity. The boyfriend was already acting distant and dismissive, which might have justified their concern. The author also made an effort to confront the situation, albeit through snooping, and left a note instead of confronting him immediately, which could have been more confrontational.\n\nBut the key issue here is the violation of privacy. Even if the intent was good, the action itself is ethically dubious. The boyfriend's reaction highlights the damage done to trust. The author might have saved time by leaving early, but the betrayal of trust could have lasting effects. \n\nAlso, the argument that \"ignorance is bliss\" is flipped here. The author chose to face the truth, which is valid, but the means to get that truth are problematic. Relationships require mutual trust, and breaking that by snooping can be seen as a betrayal in itself. \n\nThere's a balance between self-preservation and respecting boundaries. While the outcome might have been positive for the author, the method used isn't without fault. So, even though the intent was to uncover the truth, the act of snooping is ethically questionable. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they violated their partner's privacy, regardless of the outcome.\n"
