A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by snooping through their partner's phone and leaving a note. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant, and the author found out he was cheating. The author justifies it by saying they weren't being nosy but acted on a real concern.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Trust is a big part of relationships. Snooping usually breaches privacy. But the author had a reason\u2014they felt something was wrong and it turned out to be true. However, invading someone's privacy, even if justified, might set a bad precedent. Cheating is a major betrayal, so the author found out a truth that was hidden. The boyfriend then accused the author of not trusting him, which is a valid point because trust is mutual.\n\nOn one hand, the author acted out of self-preservation, avoiding prolonged heartbreak. On the other, the method was invasive. Some might argue that trust should be given, and confronting the partner directly, even if uncomfortable, is better than snooping. But the author tried to talk about it first and was met with vague answers, which might have justified their actions.\n\nDifferent perspectives: some would say privacy is a right, and snooping is wrong regardless. Others might see it as a necessary action given the circumstances. The key is that the author had a genuine concern, not just curiosity, which differentiates their case from friends who snoop out of nosiness. Still, the act of snooping itself is ethically questionable, even if the outcome was positive. So, is the author at fault? It's a bit of a gray area. The answer depends on whether one prioritizes privacy over the right to self-protection. The question is whether the method (snooping) was wrong despite the outcome.\n"
