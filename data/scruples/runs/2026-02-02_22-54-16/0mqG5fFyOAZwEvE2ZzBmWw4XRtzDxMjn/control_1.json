A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone and finding out about an affair. The options are A for yes (they're wrong) or B for no (they're not).\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author's boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned feeling depressed. The author suspected something was wrong, so while he was asleep, they checked his phone and discovered he was cheating. The author left a note and left, leading to a confrontation where the boyfriend accused them of invading his privacy and not trusting him. The author justifies their actions by saying they did it to avoid future heartbreak and that they're not pro-snooping unless there's a strong reason.\n\nNow, considering the ethical and social implications. Snooping through a partner's phone is generally considered a violation of privacy. Trust is a cornerstone of any relationship, and without explicit consent, checking someone's phone can be seen as a breach of that trust. Even if there are suspicions, the method used here (snooping without discussing it first) might be seen as a problem. The boyfriend felt betrayed because of the privacy invasion, which the author acknowledges but still defends their actions because the cheating was confirmed.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's motivation was based on a genuine fear of being cheated on, and the action did uncover the infidelity. The author left the relationship, which is a reasonable response upon discovering betrayal. They also draw a distinction between their justified snoop and friends who snoop out of mere nosiness.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) the violation of privacy, 2) the reasonableness of the action given the circumstances, and 3) the outcome (ending the relationship vs. staying in a deceptive one). \n\nIn many societal and relational contexts, even if the outcome is justified (finding out about the cheating), the means (snooping) are often frowned upon because it undermines trust. Relationships require mutual respect for boundaries. While the cheating is the boyfriend's fault, the act of snooping without conversation or consent is typically seen as the wrong move. The author's defense might be that they were protecting themselves, but the method is still ethically questionable.\n\nSo, in the AITA framework, people often debate both sides. The community might consider the boyfriend's cheating as his wrongdoing, but the author's snoop as their fault. The answer would likely depend on whether the community prioritizes the violation of privacy over the outcome. In many cases, the person who snoops is considered the \"asshole\" because they broke trust, even if it led to a revelation. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
