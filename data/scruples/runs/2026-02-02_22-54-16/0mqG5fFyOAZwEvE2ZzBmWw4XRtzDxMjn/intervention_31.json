A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone and finding out about an affair. The writer justifies their actions by saying they had a gut feeling something was wrong and that they wanted to avoid future heartbreak. They also differentiate themselves from friends who snoop out of mere nosiness.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Snooping into someone's phone without their consent generally violates their privacy. Even in a relationship, trust is a cornerstone. The partner might argue that the snooping was a breach of trust, which could be valid. However, the writer also points out that the other person was already unfaithful, which complicates things.\n\nNext, the legal aspect: depending on the jurisdiction, secretly accessing someone's phone could be illegal, especially if it involves reading messages without permission. But the user might not be asking about legality, more about moral rightness.\n\nEmotionally, the writer was dealing with a cheating partner. The act of cheating is a significant betrayal. The writer's actions led to the discovery of the infidelity, which could be seen as a way to end the relationship prematurely and avoid further pain. However, the method of discovery involved invading privacy, which some might see as crossing a line.\n\nThe partner's reaction was anger, accusing the writer of not trusting them. Trust is essential in a relationship, and snooping can be seen as a lack of trust. But if the partner was already cheating, the trust was already broken. The writer might argue that their actions were justified because the trust was already compromised.\n\nThe writer also mentions they left a note and didn't confront the partner immediately, which might be considered a respectful approach after the discovery. However, the act of snooping itself is still ethically questionable.\n\nOn one hand, the writer prevented prolonged emotional suffering by ending the relationship early. On the other, they used a method that violated their partner's privacy. It's a tough balance between self-preservation and respecting boundaries.\n\nIn some perspectives, the ends justify the means. If the writer had stayed unaware, they might have continued in a harmful relationship. But others might say that trust should be given even in the face of suspicion, and that snooping undermines that trust.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer might depend on whether the focus is on the violation of privacy (which is a wrong) or the prevention of further harm (which could justify the action). Different people have different values here. Some might side with the writer, others with the boyfriend. The question is whether the writer is in the wrong. The answer could be either A or B based on these considerations, but I need to decide based on the arguments presented.\n"
