A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The author's boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned being in a depressive hole, but the author suspected something else. They snooped while he was asleep and found out he was cheating. Then they left a note and left, and the boyfriend yelled at them for invading his privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. Snooping through someone's phone without their consent is a violation of privacy. Even if the author had reasons, like suspicion of cheating, it's generally considered a breach of trust. Privacy is a fundamental aspect in relationships, and entering someone's phone without permission can be seen as a significant transgression.\n\nHowever, the author's reasoning is that they acted out of concern and to prevent future heartbreak. They mention that they're not pro-snooping unless there's a strong reason, distinguishing themselves from nosy friends. The key here is whether the ends justify the means. The author found out the truth and ended the relationship quickly, which might have saved them from more pain.\n\nOn one hand, cheating is definitely a betrayal, and the author has valid feelings. But the method of discovering the infidelity through snooping complicates things. Relationships require trust, and if trust is broken by snooping, even if justified by the outcome, it's a two-way street. The boyfriend's reaction is also important\u2014he called the author a piece of shit, which is harsh, but his point about privacy is valid.\n\nLaws and social norms vary, but generally, snooping is frowned upon. Even if the result was good, the action itself is ethically questionable. The author might not be \"in the wrong\" in terms of their intentions, but their action is a breach of privacy. The question is whether the action itself makes them in the wrong regardless of the outcome.\n\nAnother angle is the communication aspect. The author didn't confront the boyfriend directly, which might have been a better approach. Leaving a note instead of discussing it could be seen as cutting off communication, which isn't ideal. However, the boyfriend was already emotionally distant, which might have made it hard for the author to confront him.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author had a valid reason and the outcome was the truth being revealed, the act of snooping without consent is a breach of trust and privacy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong in terms of their actions, even if their intentions were to protect themselves from further harm.\n"
