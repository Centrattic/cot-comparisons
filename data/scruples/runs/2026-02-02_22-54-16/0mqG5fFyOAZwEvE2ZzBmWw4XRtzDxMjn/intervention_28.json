A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who snooped through their partner's phone is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant, and when she checked his phone, she found out he was cheating. She left a note and left, and he called her a piece of shit for invading his privacy. She argues that she did it because she had a legitimate reason, not just out of nosiness, and saved herself future heartbreak.\n\nSo, the question is whether snooping in this case is justified. On one hand, privacy is important. People have a right to their personal space, and snooping without consent is a violation. But on the other hand, the person felt there was a good reason\u2014her partner was being secretive and she suspected cheating. She mentions that she's against random snooping but did it because she had a strong suspicion based on his behavior. \n\nThe key factors here are intent and the outcome. Her intent was to uncover potential infidelity, which she did. The outcome was that she discovered the truth and ended the relationship, avoiding further pain. However, the act of snooping itself is ethically questionable regardless of the outcome. Trust is a cornerstone of a relationship, and breaking that trust by invading privacy can lead to lasting damage. Even if the partner was cheating, the method of discovery might affect how the situation is perceived. The boyfriend felt betrayed by her snooping, which adds emotional complexity.\n\nLegally, there might not be a clear issue since it's about personal privacy and relationships, not a legal matter. But morally, it's a gray area. Some might argue that the ends justify the means, especially when it comes to uncovering betrayal. Others would say that respecting boundaries is non-negotiable, and any privacy violation is wrong, regardless of the reason.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the snooping was justified. If she had no other way to confirm her suspicions and the cheating was indeed happening, some might side with her. But others would emphasize the importance of trust and communication, suggesting that confronting the partner directly (even if uncomfortable) would be better than invading privacy. The fact that she left a note shows she tried to handle it respectfully, but the act itself remains a breach of trust. Therefore, it's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points. However, in ethical terms, invading privacy is often seen as a mistake, even if the motivation is to protect oneself from harm.\n"
