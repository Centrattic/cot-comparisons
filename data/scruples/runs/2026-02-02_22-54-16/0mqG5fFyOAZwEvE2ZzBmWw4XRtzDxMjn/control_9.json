A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone and then breaking up with him after finding out about the cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Snooping into someone's phone is a clear invasion of privacy. Normally, that's a big no-no because everyone deserves a certain level of privacy in a relationship. Trust is a fundamental part of any healthy relationship, and violating that trust by snooping can be seen as a betrayal.\n\nHowever, the author mentions that their boyfriend was acting distant and had a depressive episode. They felt a gut feeling that something was wrong. In this context, the author's actions might be seen as motivated by concern rather than mere nosiness. The key difference here is that the author had a legitimate reason to suspect infidelity, unlike friends who snoop for no reason. \n\nThe author also points out that they didn't act on impulse but took the time to leave a note and then left. They didn't confront the boyfriend immediately with anger but chose to document their findings. This could be seen as a mature response compared to a more impulsive reaction. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend was upset about the privacy violation. He felt that the snooping proved a lack of trust. Even though the author's intention was to uncover the truth, the method used was invasive. The argument here is that trust should be based on open communication rather than surveillance. \n\nBut then again, the author's action did lead to the truth coming out, which saved them from further heartbreak. The cheating was real, so the outcome was that the author avoided a harmful situation. However, the means used to get there were still ethically questionable. \n\nIt's a bit of a dilemma. The action itself is wrong because it violates privacy, but the intention and the context (cheating was happening) might mitigate the blame. The question is whether the ends justify the means. In ethical terms, usually, the means matter. So even if the outcome was positive, the act of snooping is still a breach of trust.\n\nAnother angle: if the author had communicated their concerns first, maybe things could have been resolved differently. Instead, they chose to snoop, which could have been avoided if they had addressed the issue directly. But the boyfriend's cheating might have made that communication impossible, as he wasn't being honest. \n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions were to find the truth and protect themselves, the method used was an invasion of privacy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
