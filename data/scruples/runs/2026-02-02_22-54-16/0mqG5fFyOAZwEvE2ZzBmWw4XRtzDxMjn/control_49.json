A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone and found out about the cheating. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The main issue is privacy. The author admits to sneaking into their boyfriend's phone without his knowledge. Even though they had a reason\u2014they felt something was wrong and later found out he was cheating\u2014it's still a violation of trust and privacy.\n\nTrust and consent are crucial in relationships. The author didn't confront the boyfriend directly first but chose to invade his privacy. While the outcome was discovering infidelity, the means of discovery were questionable. The boyfriend's reaction was to yell and accuse the author of not trusting him, which highlights the breach of trust.\n\nHowever, the author's intention was to protect themselves from further heartbreak. They mention that they left a note and didn't confront him immediately, which might be seen as trying to handle the situation calmly. But the act of snooping itself is problematic regardless of the outcome. \n\nThere's also the argument about whether the ends justify the means. Even if the author was right about the cheating, the method used could have damaged the relationship's foundation. Relationships require mutual trust, and snooping undermines that. The author might have been justified in feeling hurt, but the action still crosses a line.\n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that the boyfriend's cheating was the real issue, and the author was just taking proactive steps to avoid more pain. But that doesn't make the snooping right. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not just about the boyfriend's actions. \n\nLooking at similar situations, most ethical guidelines would say that privacy should be respected unless there's explicit consent. The author's action, while perhaps understandable, is still a breach. Therefore, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the violation of privacy, even if the outcome was justified.\n"
