A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant, the author suspected something, and found out he was cheating. The author left a note and left, then the boyfriend yelled at them for invading privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of snooping. Generally, invading someone's privacy is seen as wrong because it breaches trust. Even if the intention was to uncover infidelity, the method of doing so without consent could be problematic. \n\nBut the author mentions they had a \"gut feeling\" something was wrong and that their friends snoop for no reason, which they disapprove of. They justify it by saying they saved themselves future heartbreak. However, the boyfriend felt betrayed because of the lack of trust. \n\nThere's a balance between self-preservation and respecting others' privacy. Cheating is a serious issue, and being in a situation where trust is broken can be traumatic. The author's actions might have been driven by a desire to protect themselves from ongoing emotional harm. \n\nBut legally and ethically, checking someone's phone without their knowledge is a violation of privacy. Even if the outcome was good (discovering the infidelity), the means might still be considered wrong. The boyfriend's reaction about the lack of trust is a valid point. Trust is fundamental in a relationship, and without it, the relationship can't thrive. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel they were justified because they were trying to uncover the truth to avoid prolonged suffering. However, the method of discovering the truth through snooping might not absolve them of the ethical implications. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong because they violated privacy, which is a breach of trust, even if their intention was to protect themselves. The key here is that the method (snooping) is ethically questionable regardless of the outcome. Therefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
