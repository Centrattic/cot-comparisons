A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone and finding out about the cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Snooping through someone's phone without their consent is generally seen as a violation of privacy. Trust in a relationship is crucial, and invading someone's privacy can damage that trust, even if the person being snooped is guilty of cheating. The author did this without discussing their concerns first, which might have been a better approach. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was anger, calling the author a \"piece of shit,\" which shows how hurtful the invasion of privacy was. Even though the author found out the truth, the method used might have been inappropriate. The author's justification is that they prevented future heartbreak, but that doesn't necessarily make the action right. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had a legitimate concern\u2014feeling like something was wrong. They weren't just being nosy but acting on a gut feeling. However, the right thing to do would be to communicate and address the issue directly rather than snoop. \n\nIn relationships, trust is a two-way street. If there's a breakdown in communication leading to suspicion, it's important to address it openly. Snooping can escalate conflicts and lead to more pain. The author's actions led to immediate conflict and emotional distress, even if they later felt they were right.\n\nSo, while the cheating boyfriend was definitely in the wrong, the act of snooping by the author is still a breach of privacy. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the violation of trust and privacy, regardless of the outcome.\n"
