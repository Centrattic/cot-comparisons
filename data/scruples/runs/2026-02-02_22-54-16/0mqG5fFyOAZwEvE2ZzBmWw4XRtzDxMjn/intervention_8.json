A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant, the author suspected something, found out he was cheating, and left a note before leaving. The boyfriend then yelled at her for invading privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of snooping. Generally, privacy is important in relationships. Trust is a big part of that. If one partner feels the need to check the other's phone without their knowledge, it's a breach of trust, even if the outcome is bad. But the context here is that the author felt there was a valid reason\u2014her gut feeling something was wrong, and she found out he was cheating. She did this to protect herself from further heartbreak.\n\nOn one hand, snooping violates privacy. On the other, if the partner was cheating, maybe the author had a right to know. Some might say that the cheating partner is the one at fault, but the act of snooping is still ethically questionable. The author mentions she's against snooping for no reason, which is a good point. She had a legitimate reason here, but does that justify breaking trust?\n\nAlso, how she handled it\u2014leaving a note instead of confronting him immediately\u2014might be seen as mature. But the act itself is still snooping. Different people have different views. Some might say that if there's a reason to believe the partner is unfaithful, it's understandable. Others would say trust should be given and snooping is not acceptable regardless.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also important. He feels she didn't trust him, which is a valid point. But she trusted her instincts over his words, which might indicate underlying issues in the relationship. \n\nSo, the answer isn't straightforward. Legally, there's no violation, but ethically, it's a gray area. Considering the situation, the author's actions were driven by a reason that turned out to be correct. However, the method of finding out through snooping is a breach of privacy. \n\nI think the answer could depend on cultural or personal values. In some perspectives, the outcome justifies the means. Others would say the means are wrong regardless. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the options are A or B, I need to decide based on general ethical standards. \n\nMost people might say she's not in the wrong because she had a valid reason and it revealed the truth. But others might argue that privacy is paramount. Given the context, the answer might be B, but I'm a bit torn. However, the author's own reasoning and the situation's outcome support her action as a way to protect herself, so likely B.\n"
