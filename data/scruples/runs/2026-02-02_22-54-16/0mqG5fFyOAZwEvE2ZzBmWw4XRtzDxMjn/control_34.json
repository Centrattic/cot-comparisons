A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about snooping through a partner's phone. Let me start by breaking down the details.\n\nThe boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned he was in a depressive hole. The author couldn't shake the feeling something was off, so they checked his phone while he was asleep. They found out he was cheating. The author left a note and left without confronting him directly. The boyfriend was upset, accused her of not trusting him and called her a piece of shit. The author justifies it by saying they wanted to avoid future heartbreak and that they're not nosy like some friends, but only acted when they felt something was really wrong.\n\nFirst, trust is a big part of relationships. Snooping can be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the partner was acting distant, invading their privacy without discussing it first might be problematic. The author mentions they asked what was up and got a vague answer, which probably made them more suspicious. However, checking someone's phone is a clear invasion of privacy. \n\nBut there's also the angle that the boyfriend was unfaithful. The author found out the truth and avoided further emotional pain. Cheating is a serious issue, so maybe the author was justified in seeking the truth. However, the method they used (snooping) might still be wrong regardless of the outcome. \n\nThe author argues that they're different from friends who snoop out of nosiness. They had a reason based on the partner's behavior. Still, the act of checking without consent is a violation. Even if the intention was to uncover infidelity, the method could be considered wrong because it's about respecting each other's boundaries.\n\nIn many relationships, privacy is important. If trust is broken, it's a two-way issue. The boyfriend cheated, which is a betrayal, but the author also broke trust by snooping. However, some might say that the cheating is the bigger betrayal. The question is whether the means (snooping) justify the ends (finding out about the affair).\n\nLegal perspectives might not matter here because it's about moral judgment. Morally, both actions are violations of trust. The author might feel justified because they ended up saving themselves from more hurt, but in terms of right and wrong actions, both parties acted unethically in terms of trust and privacy.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, snooping is a privacy violation. On the other hand, ending a relationship with a cheater is understandable. But the act of sneaking into his phone was a breach of trust. The boyfriend was upset because the author didn't trust him enough to discuss the issues instead of snooping. The author's actions could have led to confrontation, but they chose to leave, which might be their right if they felt betrayed.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's action was a privacy violation, which is generally considered wrong, even if it led to a painful but truthful outcome. So the answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong). But others might argue that the cheating made it excusable. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not whether their action was understandable. So, the act of snooping was wrong regardless of the justification.\n"
