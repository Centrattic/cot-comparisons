A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone and finding out he was cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that their boyfriend was acting distant and gave a vague reason about being in a depressive hole. They had a gut feeling something was wrong. They snooped while he was asleep and found evidence of cheating. The author left a note and left, then the boyfriend yelled at them for invading privacy and said it showed a lack of trust.\n\nThe author justifies their actions by saying they did it to avoid long-term heartbreak and that they're against snooping without a reason. They contrast themselves with friends who snoop out of nosiness.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, snooping into someone's phone without consent is generally considered a violation of privacy. Trust is a cornerstone of relationships, and without explicit permission, accessing a partner's phone can be seen as a breach of that trust. Even if the intent was to uncover infidelity, the method might be problematic because it undermines the foundation of trust. The boyfriend's reaction highlights this, as he felt betrayed by the invasion of privacy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had a legitimate suspicion based on the partner's behavior and the discovery of cheating. They argue that they saved themselves from further heartbreak. Some might argue that the ends justify the means in this case. However, the act of snooping still crosses a boundary, and the author's justification might not mitigate the ethical issue of violating privacy.\n\nBut is it right to judge based on the outcome? The author found out the truth, but the manner in which they did it could have been handled differently. Open communication is usually the preferred method, even if it's uncomfortable. However, if the partner was deceptive, the author might feel they had no choice. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, respecting privacy is important regardless of the situation. So even if the author's intentions were to protect themselves, the act of snooping is still a violation. The boyfriend's reaction is a direct consequence of that violation. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong because they violated their partner's privacy, even if it led to a true discovery. The ethical issue of privacy is separate from the outcome. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
