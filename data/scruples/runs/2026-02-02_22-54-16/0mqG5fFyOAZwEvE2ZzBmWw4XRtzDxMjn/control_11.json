A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author snooping through their partner's phone and finding out about an affair, leading to the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects of snooping. Generally, invading someone's privacy is considered a breach of trust, even in a relationship. Relationships are built on mutual trust and respect, and secretly checking a partner's phone without their consent can be seen as a violation of that trust. The author's actions might be justified in their eyes because they discovered infidelity, but the method they used is questionable.\n\nThe author argues that they had a \"gut feeling\" something was wrong and that they did it to save themselves future heartbreak. They also differentiate themselves from friends who snoop out of nosiness. However, the key issue here is consent. Regardless of the outcome, the act of snooping without permission is a privacy violation. Even if the result was beneficial, the action itself is ethically problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner felt betrayed not just by the cheating but by the privacy invasion. The author's partner might argue that the snooping was an overstep, especially if the author didn't trust them enough to address the issue through open communication first. The partner's reaction of yelling and calling the author a \"piece of shit\" shows how hurtful this action was, even if the author's intention was to uncover the truth.\n\nBut then again, the cheating partner is also at fault. The infidelity itself is a major betrayal. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The act of snooping, while perhaps revealing a deeper issue, is still an invasion of privacy. The author might argue that they had a right to know, especially if they suspected something was wrong. But in ethical terms, privacy is a fundamental right, and relationships should ideally handle such issues through honest communication rather than covert actions.\n\nAnother angle is the impact of the action. The author left a note and didn't confront the partner immediately, which might be seen as a respectful way to handle the situation after the fact. However, the initial act of snooping is still questionable. The partner's anger over the privacy breach is valid, and the author's justification that they \"saved\" themselves from heartbreak doesn't negate the ethical issue of the snooping itself.\n\nIn many relationships, trust is foundational. If the author didn't trust their partner, maybe there were underlying issues that needed to be addressed before resorting to snooping. The fact that the partner was indeed cheating complicates things, but the author's actions still crossed a line. The partner might have appreciated being confronted directly or given the benefit of the doubt instead of being snooped on.\n\nSo, balancing the two sides: the author acted out of concern and discovered a betrayal, but the method was a privacy violation. However, the partner was unfaithful, which is a significant wrongdoing. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for snooping. From an ethical standpoint, yes, because privacy matters. But in the context of a cheating partner, maybe the author's actions are more understandable. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong, not whether the situation is entirely the partner's fault.\n\nI think the answer leans towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the privacy violation, even though the outcome was the discovery of infidelity. The act itself is ethically questionable regardless of the result.\n"
