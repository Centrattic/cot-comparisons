A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant, and the author found out he was cheating by checking his phone. The boyfriend reacted angrily, saying the author didn't trust him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of snooping. Generally, people value privacy, so checking someone's phone without permission is a breach of that trust. Even if the intention was to find the truth, the method might be questionable. The author mentions they have friends who snoop for no reason, but they drew a line at that, which shows they see a difference between justified and unjustified snooping. However, their action still involved invading privacy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author felt a strong gut feeling something was wrong and wanted to avoid future heartbreak. They did leave a note and didn't confront him immediately, which might be seen as trying to handle it respectfully after the fact. But the boyfriend still felt disrespected, which adds another layer.\n\nLegal aspects might vary, but ethically, trust is a cornerstone in relationships. The author's action could be seen as undermining trust, even if it revealed the truth. However, the outcome was that the author avoided a cheating relationship, which is a valid concern. \n\nSo, weighing the breach of privacy against the harm avoided. Some might argue that the ends justify the means here, but others would say that trust should be mutual and that communication is the right approach. The author's friends snooping without reason is different from a justified suspicion. Still, consent is key in any relationship. Without it, the act is a violation regardless of the outcome. Therefore, the author is in the wrong ethically for snooping, even if the result was beneficial.\n"
