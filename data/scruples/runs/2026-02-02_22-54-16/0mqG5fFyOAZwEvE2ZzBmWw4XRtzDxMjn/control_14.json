A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about snooping through their boyfriend's phone. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend was acting distant and said he was in a depressive hole. The author couldn't shake the feeling something was wrong, so they checked his phone while he was asleep. They found out he was cheating. Then they left a note and left. The boyfriend called them a piece of shit for invading his privacy and said that shows a lack of trust.\n\nThe author argues that they didn't do it out of nosiness but because they had a strong feeling something was wrong. They mention that they're against snooping for no reason, only when there's a real issue. They also say they saved themselves future heartbreak.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is whether snooping was justified. Trust and privacy are big factors in relationships. Cheating is a serious betrayal, but invading someone's privacy to find that out can also be seen as a violation. The author felt justified because they had reasons to suspect something, but the boyfriend felt his privacy was invaded. \n\nOn one hand, the author's actions were based on suspicion and led to a painful but necessary truth. On the other hand, respecting privacy is important. Even if there's a suspicion, going through someone's phone without consent can damage trust. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected, which the author acknowledges but doesn't address. \n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. The author had their reasons, but the method might still be wrong. The question is whether the ends justify the means. In relationships, trust is crucial, and if you don't have that trust, it's already a problem. So maybe the author is in the wrong because even with suspicion, snooping breaches trust and privacy. Alternatively, if the cheating was already happening, maybe the author's action was a way to uncover the betrayal that was already there. But the act of snooping itself is still a violation. \n\nI'm leaning towards A, the author is in the wrong. Even if the suspicion was there, going through someone's phone without consent is a breach of privacy. The boyfriend's trust was broken not because he cheated, but because the author didn't trust him enough to talk it out instead of invading his privacy. The author could have addressed the distance and concerns through communication rather than snooping. So even though the outcome might have saved heartbreak, the method used was wrong.\n"
