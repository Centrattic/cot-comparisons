A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone and discovering the infidelity. The partner got angry about the privacy invasion, saying it shows a lack of trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications of snooping. Generally, invading someone's privacy is frowned upon, even in relationships. Trust is a two-way street, and if someone feels the need to check their partner's phone, it might indicate underlying issues in the relationship. However, in this case, the author had a valid reason\u2014they suspected something was wrong, and their gut feeling was right. The partner was indeed cheating.\n\nOn one hand, the author's actions led to uncovering the betrayal, which could prevent future heartbreak. They made a choice not to confront the partner directly but to leave a note and end the relationship. This shows some level of maturity, as they didn't escalate the situation with an argument.\n\nOn the other hand, snooping without consent breaches trust, regardless of the outcome. The partner felt disrespected and hurt because their privacy was invaded. Even if the result was beneficial, the method might still be problematic. Relationships require mutual trust, and if that's not present, the foundation is weak. The author's justification is that they acted out of self-preservation, but does that excuse the breach of privacy?\n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's friends snooping for no reason, which they're against. The author distinguishes their action by having a \"gut feeling,\" but that still doesn't make it right. The line between justified and unjustified snooping is blurry here.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, the means don't always justify the ends. Even if the outcome was good (discovering the affair), the method involved deceit and lack of respect for the partner's autonomy. Relationships require open communication, and if the author had concerns, addressing them directly would have been the healthier approach. \n\nHowever, if the partner was indeed unfaithful and the author had no way to confront them without evidence, the situation is more complex. Cheating is a betrayal, and the author had every right to be hurt. The question is whether the means of discovering the truth were appropriate.\n\nConsidering all angles, while the outcome was beneficial, the act of snooping itself is ethically questionable. The author's actions, though understandable given the circumstances, still violated the partner's privacy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
