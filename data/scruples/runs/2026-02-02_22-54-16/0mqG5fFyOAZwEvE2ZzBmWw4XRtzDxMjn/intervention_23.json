A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned being in a depressive hole. The writer, feeling a gut instinct something was wrong, checked his phone while he was asleep and found out he was cheating. They left a note and left, then he called and yelled at them for invading privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of snooping. Generally, invading someone's privacy is seen as wrong because it breaches trust. However, the writer adds context that they had a reason\u2014they felt something was off, and their intuition led them to discover the infidelity. They also mention they're against snooping for no reason, only when there's a strong suspicion.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is to yell and blame them for not trusting, but he was the one cheating. The writer's action led to ending a harmful relationship early. The key points here are the motivation behind the snooping and the consequences. While the act itself is a violation of privacy, the outcome was uncovering betrayal. \n\nBut does the end justify the means? Some might argue that trust is foundational in a relationship, and snooping undermines that, regardless of the outcome. Others might see it as a necessary action given the context of the cheating. The writer's reasoning is that they saved themselves future heartbreak, which is a valid perspective. However, the method used could have been approached differently, like direct communication if there were concerns.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is not in the wrong, and they want to know if I agree. The answer options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). Considering the context, the decision isn't straightforward. The act of snooping is ethically questionable, but the circumstances of uncovering cheating might mitigate the blame. It's a balance between privacy violation and self-protection. The answer might lean towards B, not wrong, given the justified reason and the positive outcome despite the method.\n"
