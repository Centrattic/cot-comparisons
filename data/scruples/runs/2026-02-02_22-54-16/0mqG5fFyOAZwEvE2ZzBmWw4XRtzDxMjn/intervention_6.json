A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author's boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned he was in a depressive hole. The author couldn't shake the feeling something was wrong, so they snoop through his phone while he was asleep. They found he was cheating. Then they left a note and left, but the boyfriend was angry about the privacy invasion and accused the author of not trusting him.\n\nThe author argues that they aren't pro-snooping unless there's a good reason, unlike friends who do it out of nosiness. They believe they did the right thing because it saved them future heartbreak by ending the relationship early.\n\nNow, considering the question: Is the author in the wrong?\n\nFirst, the ethical aspect of privacy. Generally, people expect their phone to be private. Even in a relationship, there's a boundary. Snooping without consent is a violation, regardless of the reason. But there's also the context of the author's suspicion and the outcome. The author found out about the cheating, which is a valid reason to end the relationship, but the method of finding out involved invading privacy.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also part of the equation. He's upset about the privacy violation and accuses the author of not trusting him. Trust is crucial in relationships, and snooping can be seen as a breach of trust. However, the author felt betrayed by the infidelity, which might justify their actions in their eyes.\n\nThere's a balance between respecting privacy and protecting oneself from harm. The author might argue that their actions were necessary to uncover the betrayal. But others might say that trust should be given unless there's clear evidence, and that snooping undermines the relationship's foundation.\n\nLegally, there might not be a violation, but ethically, it's more nuanced. The author's friends snooping for no reason is different from someone acting on a legitimate concern. But the line is blurry. Even if the reason is valid, the act of snooping still breaches trust and privacy.\n\nSo, considering both sides: the author's intention was to find out the truth about their partner's cheating, which is a significant betrayal. However, the method involved invading privacy, which is generally considered wrong. The author's actions might be understandable given the circumstances, but ethically, it's still a violation. The boyfriend's anger is about the privacy breach, not just the cheating. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's suspicion was valid and the outcome was bad, the act of snooping without consent is a breach of trust and privacy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
