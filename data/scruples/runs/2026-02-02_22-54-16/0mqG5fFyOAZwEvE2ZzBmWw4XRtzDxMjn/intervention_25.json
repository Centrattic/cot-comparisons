A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The story says that the boyfriend was acting distant, and after snooping, the person found out he was cheating. The author justifies it by saying they felt something was really wrong, not just being nosy like some friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of snooping. Generally, privacy is important in relationships, and sneaking around to check a partner's phone can be seen as a breach of trust. But the author mentions that they had a reason\u2014there were signs of something being off. They also contrast themselves with friends who snoop out of mere curiosity, so their justification is based on perceived necessity.\n\nOn the other hand, cheating is a betrayal, and the person might feel justified in uncovering it to protect themselves from future heartbreak. However, the method of uncovering it through snooping could be problematic. Even if the outcome was that the partner was cheating, the act of invading privacy without consent is still an issue. The boyfriend's reaction about not being trusted is valid because trust is a fundamental part of any relationship, and snooping undermines that.\n\nAlso, the author left a note and didn't confront him immediately, which might be seen as a mature way to handle it, but the act of snooping itself is still ethically questionable regardless of the outcome. There's a difference between having a reason to act and being in the right. Even if the outcome was positive, the action might still be considered wrong because it violated privacy. So it's a bit of a gray area. But from an ethical standpoint, respecting someone's privacy is important, and snooping isn't a recommended solution even if there's suspicion. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
