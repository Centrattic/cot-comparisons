A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author's boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned being in a depressive hole. The author felt a gut feeling something was wrong, so they snoop while he's asleep and finds out he's cheating. They left a note and left, then he yells at her for invading privacy and says she didn't trust him.\n\nThe key points here are trust, privacy, and the justification for snooping. The author mentions they're against snooping for no reason but did it because they sensed something was really wrong. They argue that they saved themselves future heartbreak by finding out early.\n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, snooping violates privacy, which is a big deal in relationships. Trust is foundational, and if you don't trust your partner, that can be a red flag. The boyfriend was upset because he felt his privacy was invaded, which is a valid concern. On the other hand, the author had reasons to suspect something was wrong beyond just the depressive comment. The cheating partner might have kept it hidden, leading to more hurt later. The author's actions led to an early exit from a deceitful relationship.\n\nBut is the act of snooping itself wrong? Even if the outcome was positive, the method involved breaking trust through invasion of privacy. Some might argue that if trust is already an issue, the relationship has deeper problems. Others might say that in cases of suspected cheating, snooping is a necessary step to uncover the truth.\n\nThe author claims they acted because they had a strong suspicion, not out of mere nosiness. However, consent and mutual respect for boundaries are important. Even if the outcome was good, the means could still be considered wrong. The boyfriend's reaction highlights the breach of trust. The author's reasoning is that they prevented long-term heartbreak, but it's a fine line between self-preservation and overstepping.\n\nIn many ethical discussions, privacy is a right, and violating it can be seen as wrong regardless of the outcome. So even if the author found out the truth, the act of snooping is still a breach. However, the context of a cheating partner might make some people empathize with the author's decision. The question is whether the ends justify the means.\n\nBut the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would depend on societal norms. In many cases, people argue that snooping is wrong because it breaks trust and invades privacy, even if justified by the results. However, others might see it as a justified action under the circumstances. The author's friends who snoop out of nosiness are different, but in this case, there was a legitimate reason. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions were harmful in terms of privacy, the context of cheating might make people split. But typically, in such scenarios, the act of snooping is still considered wrong because it's a breach of trust and privacy, regardless of the outcome. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
