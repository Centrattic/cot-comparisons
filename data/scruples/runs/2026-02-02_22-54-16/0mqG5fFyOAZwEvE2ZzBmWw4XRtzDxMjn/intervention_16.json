A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who snoop through their partner's phone is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant, and after being told he was in a depressive hole, the person snuck into his phone and found out he was cheating. They left a note and left, then he yelled at them for invading privacy and not trusting him.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know my take. The answer needs to be A or B. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and ethical aspects. Snooping into someone's phone without permission is generally a violation of privacy. Even if the intent was to find out the truth, it's an invasion of trust. Relationships are built on mutual trust and respect. If one partner feels the need to snoop, it might indicate underlying trust issues. But the author's reasoning is that they were acting on a gut feeling and found out the truth, which saved them future heartbreak.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend was upset because he felt his privacy was violated. The author's action might have been a breach of trust, even if their intention was to protect themselves. The key here is whether the ends justify the means. The author believes that knowing the truth was necessary, but the method involved breaking trust.\n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. The author didn't confront the boyfriend directly, which might have been a better approach, even if uncomfortable. By leaving a note and then the boyfriend yelling, it shows that the action caused immediate conflict. \n\nLegal perspective? In most places, accessing someone else's phone without consent can have legal repercussions, but that's a different angle. The question is about being in the wrong, which is more about morality here.\n\nThe author's friends snoop for no reason, but the author differentiates themselves by saying they had a valid reason. However, the validity of the reason is subjective. The boyfriend's depression could have been a red herring, and the author's action might have been based on suspicion rather than evidence. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If a partner can't trust the other without evidence, that can be a problem. The author's action might have been a result of not trusting their partner's honesty, even if the partner was being truthful about depression but had an affair. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the act of snooping violates privacy and trust. Even if the outcome was beneficial for the author, the method used is ethically questionable. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they chose to invade privacy instead of addressing the issue through open communication or seeking evidence through other means. The answer would be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
