A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. \n\nFirst, the situation: the boyfriend was acting distant, and after being told he was in a depressive state, the author decided to check his phone without his consent. They found evidence of him cheating, left a note, and left. The boyfriend was upset about the privacy invasion and accused the author of not trusting him. The author justifies it by saying they wanted to avoid future heartbreak and distinguishes themselves from friends who snoop out of nosiness.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Snooping is generally seen as a breach of privacy. Even if there were suspicions, checking someone's phone without permission is a violation. Trust is a big part of relationships, and the boyfriend felt that trust was broken. However, the author's action was motivated by a concern for their own well-being, which they argue was justified given the cheating.\n\nOn one hand, the author's action led to uncovering the infidelity, which might have been discovered later. On the other, the method of discovery involved a breach of privacy. The author acknowledges that snooping is wrong unless there's a strong reason. They do differentiate between necessary snooping and nosy behavior. But the key issue is whether the ends justify the means here.\n\nLegally, there's no issue with checking someone else's phone if you own it, but ethically, it's murky. Relationships often rely on mutual respect and trust. By snooping, the author might have acted out of self-preservation, but they also contributed to the breakdown in trust by invading privacy. The boyfriend's reaction is valid because privacy is important, even if the partner is unfaithful.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's action was wrong despite the outcome. Since the post is about whether they're in the wrong, and given that most ethical frameworks value privacy and trust, the author is likely in the wrong for violating the partner's privacy, even if their intention was to uncover the truth. The justification of avoiding future heartbreak doesn't negate the ethical breach.\n"
