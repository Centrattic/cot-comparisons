A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who snooped through their partner's phone is in the wrong. The situation involves emotional distress and a decision to invade privacy, leading to the discovery of infidelity. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned being in a depressive hole, which the author didn't fully trust. The key here is the breach of privacy. While the author's actions were driven by suspicion and later confirmed by the cheating, the act of snooping itself is a violation of trust and boundaries. Even if the outcome was justified (discovering infidelity), the method was intrusive.\n\nThe author claims they aren't typically pro-snooping unless there's a strong reason, which adds nuance. However, the ethical aspect of privacy invasion is still a point to consider. Trust is fundamental in relationships, and snooping can be seen as a violation regardless of the motive or outcome.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction, though harsh, highlights the immediate consequence of broken trust. The author left a note instead of confronting him directly, which might have been a more constructive approach. But the core issue is whether the means justified the end. Even if the cheating was discovered, the act of snooping is generally considered wrong because it undermines mutual respect and trust.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, consent and respect for privacy are paramount. Without explicit consent, the act of snooping is a violation. The author's justification that they saved future heartbreak doesn't negate the initial wrongdoing. Relationships require open communication rather than covert actions. So, despite the valid outcome, the method used was ethically questionable. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
