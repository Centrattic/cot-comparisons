A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The author found out their boyfriend was cheating by checking his phone while he was asleep. They left a note and left, then the boyfriend was upset about the privacy invasion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of snooping. Generally, respecting someone's privacy is important in a relationship. Even if there are suspicions, going through someone's phone without their consent is a breach of trust. The boyfriend did cheat, which is definitely wrong, but the author's action was also a violation of privacy. \n\nThe author argues that they did it because they had a gut feeling and wanted to avoid future heartbreak. They mention that they're not in favor of snooping just out of nosiness. However, the act itself is still invasive. Even if the outcome was uncovering cheating, the method might be considered wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend reacted by yelling and calling the author a \"piece of shit,\" which is also harsh. But that doesn't make the author's actions right. The key question is whether the means justify the ends. \n\nIn relationships, trust is foundational. If trust is broken by cheating, it's understandable to want to know. However, the response to distrust (snooping) can also damage the relationship. The author might feel justified because they found out the truth, but others might see it as an overstep. \n\nI should also think about societal norms. Many people would say that privacy is important, and even if you suspect something, confronting the partner directly is better. Snooping can lead to more problems, even if it reveals the truth. \n\nSo, weighing both sides: the boyfriend cheated, which is a major issue, but the author's action of snooping without consent is also a violation. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs, but generally, invading privacy is seen as wrong regardless of the outcome. Therefore, the author might be considered in the wrong because they broke trust by snooping, even if their intention was to protect themselves.\n"
