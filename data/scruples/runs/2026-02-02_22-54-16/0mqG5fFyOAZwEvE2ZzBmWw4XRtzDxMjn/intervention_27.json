A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The key points here are the context of the snoop, the reason behind it, and the consequences.\n\nFirst, the author mentions their boyfriend was acting distant and had a depressive episode, but the author still felt something was off. They decided to check his phone while he was asleep and found out he was cheating. The author left a note and left, then the boyfriend reacted negatively, accusing them of not trusting him. The author justifies the action as being to prevent future heartbreak and distinguishes their situation from friends who snoop out of mere nosiness.\n\nNow, considering the ethical angle. Privacy is a big deal in relationships. Generally, snooping without consent is a breach of trust. However, the author had a legitimate concern based on the boyfriend's behavior, which led to the discovery of infidelity. The author's intention was to uncover something serious rather than out of jealousy or paranoia. \n\nBut from a moral standpoint, trust is foundational. Even if the result was justified, the act of snooping might still be seen as violating that trust. The boyfriend's reaction is understandable because privacy in a relationship is important. However, the cheating is a major betrayal. The author's action, while invasive, was prompted by a valid reason, and they ended the relationship upon finding out, which shows they didn't want to stay in a dishonest partnership.\n\nThere's a balance between respecting privacy and protecting oneself from harm. The author's action might be seen as a last resort given the circumstances. However, the method (snooping) is still ethically questionable, regardless of the outcome. But since the cheating was confirmed, the author could argue that their action was necessary to expose the betrayal that the partner was hiding.\n\nIn summary, while the act of snooping is generally considered wrong, the context here is a partner being unfaithful. The author acted on a valid suspicion and it led to a truthful outcome. The decision to leave the relationship after the discovery shows they prioritized their well-being. The boyfriend's anger might be more about being caught than the snooping itself. So, the answer depends on whether the means justify the end in this case. Given the cheating, some might say the author isn't in the wrong. Others might still say the snooping was wrong regardless.\n"
