A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant, and the author, after being told he was in a depressive hole, decided to check his phone while he was asleep. They found out he was cheating, left a note, and left. The boyfriend was upset about the privacy invasion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Snooping without permission is generally considered a violation of privacy. Even if the author had suspicions, accessing someone else's phone without their consent is a breach of trust. But there's also the aspect of the cheating. The author might argue that their actions were a last resort to find the truth to avoid further heartbreak.\n\nOn one hand, the author acted out of concern and ended up uncovering infidelity. On the other, the method used was invasive and dishonest. Trust is a cornerstone in relationships, and snooping can erode that trust regardless of the outcome. The boyfriend's reaction about feeling untrusted is valid here. Even if the author's intention was to protect themselves, the act of snooping might be seen as a mistake because it can lead to the relationship ending over a privacy violation instead of an honest conversation.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they're against snooping for no reason, which shows they know it's wrong in general. But in this case, they felt justified. However, the ethical question is whether the ends justify the means. Even though the result was good (discovering the cheat), the action itself was unethical. Relationships should be built on transparency and communication. Instead of snooping, the author might have been better off addressing the emotional distance through open dialogue.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because the act of snooping violates privacy and trust, even if it led to a positive outcome. The right approach would have been to communicate concerns rather than invade privacy.\n"
