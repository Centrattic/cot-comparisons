A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone and finding out he was cheating. The writer justifies their actions by saying they had a feeling something was off and wanted to avoid future heartbreak.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Snooping on someone's phone without their consent is generally considered a violation of privacy. Trust is a cornerstone in any relationship, so invading someone's privacy, even with good intentions, can be damaging. The writer mentions that they had a \"gut feeling\" and the boyfriend was acting distant. That might give some context, but it doesn't necessarily justify the action. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was to yell and accuse them of not trusting him. That's a valid point because trust is two-way. If one partner is cheating, that's a betrayal. However, the act of snooping is still a breach of trust from the writer's side. Even if they discovered the truth, the method used might have contributed to the breakdown of the relationship.\n\nThe writer also differentiates themselves from friends who snoop out of nosiness, which adds some nuance. They had a legitimate concern based on behavior changes. But the question is whether the end justifies the means. While cheating is clearly wrong, the act of snoop can't be ignored. \n\nLegally, there might not be a violation, but morally and ethically, it's a gray area. Relationships require mutual trust, and if one partner isn't trustworthy, the other might feel justified in checking. However, the method of checking without consent can lead to more issues. The writer left a note and didn't confront the boyfriend directly, which might be seen as a respectful way to handle the situation after the fact. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's cheating is a serious issue, and the writer might feel they were protecting themselves. But the act of snoop still caused immediate conflict and hurt. The key here is whether the writer's actions were a justified self-defense against a betrayal they had no other way to uncover. \n\nIn conclusion, while the writer's intentions might be understandable, the action of snoop is ethically questionable. However, given the cheating was uncovered and the relationship was likely doomed regardless, the writer might not be entirely in the wrong. It's a tough call, but leaning towards the answer being B (No), because the cheating is a significant transgression, and the writer acted on legitimate concerns, even if the method was flawed.\n"
