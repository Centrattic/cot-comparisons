A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's boyfriend was acting distant and attributed it to depression. The author had a gut feeling something was wrong, so they snooped when he was asleep. They found evidence of cheating and left a note, then left. The boyfriend yelled at her for invading his privacy and said it proved she didn't trust him. The author defends their actions by saying they did it because they sensed something was really wrong, not out of mere nosiness, and claims it saved them future heartbreak.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. Trust and privacy are key here. Generally, snooping in someone's phone without consent is a breach of privacy. Even if there's suspicion of cheating, it's a violation of trust in the relationship. However, the author mentions they had a valid reason beyond just being nosy, which they distinguish from their friends' behavior. They also made a choice to leave after finding out, which might mitigate some blame. \n\nBut in most ethical frameworks, respecting a partner's privacy is important. Cheating is a serious issue, but the method of uncovering it matters. The boyfriend's reaction about lack of trust is valid because snooping undermines trust. The author's actions might be seen as a last resort, but it's still a violation. So, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because of the breach of privacy, even with good intentions. However, some might argue that the context of suspected betrayal justifies it. But typically, the act of snooping without consent is considered wrong regardless of the reason. So I think the answer is A.\n"
