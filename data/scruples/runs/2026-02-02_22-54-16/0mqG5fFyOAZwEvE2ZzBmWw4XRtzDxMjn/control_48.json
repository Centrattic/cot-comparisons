A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant, the person suspected something, snoop the phone, found out about the affair, left a note, and the boyfriend was angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of snooping. Generally, invading someone's privacy is a no-no. Even if the person is cheating, the act of checking the phone without consent is a breach of trust and privacy. The author acknowledges that they did it because they had a gut feeling, but others do it just out of nosiness. They justify it by saying it saved them future heartbreak.\n\nBut from another angle, the boyfriend was already cheating, so the author might feel justified in wanting to know the truth. However, the method of finding out (snooping) is still a violation. The key point here is whether the ends justify the means. Even if the outcome was positive for the author (discovering the cheating), the act itself is problematic.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend felt that the lack of trust was a betrayal. Trust is fundamental in a relationship, and snooping can be seen as breaking that trust. Even if the other person is unfaithful, the initial act of snooping without discussing concerns openly could have led to a different outcome. The author didn't confront the boyfriend first, which is important. Open communication is usually the expected approach before taking such actions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't condoning casual snooping, which shows they understand the issue's complexity. They had a valid suspicion based on the boyfriend's behavior, which adds nuance. However, the moral stance here often leans towards respecting privacy, regardless of the reason. So, while the outcome might have been inevitable, the method used is still considered wrong in most ethical frameworks.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because snooping violates privacy, regardless of the justification. The author's actions contributed to the breakdown of trust, which the boyfriend pointed out. Even if the cheating was already happening, the means of discovery matter in terms of ethical responsibility.\n"
