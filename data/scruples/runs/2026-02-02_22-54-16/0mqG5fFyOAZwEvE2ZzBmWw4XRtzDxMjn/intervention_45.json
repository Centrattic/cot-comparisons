A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by snooping through their partner's phone and leaving a note before leaving. They want to know if the answer is A (yes, they're in the wrong) or B (no, they're not). \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, snooping into someone's phone is generally considered a breach of privacy. Trust is a big part of a relationship, and invading privacy like that can damage it. The boyfriend's reaction was anger and calling the author a \"piece of shit,\" which is pretty harsh, but maybe he felt violated. The author argues that they had a reason\u2014they felt something was off, and they found evidence of cheating. They also mention that they didn't want to live in ignorance and saved themselves heartbreak.\n\nOn the other hand, cheating is a betrayal, and the author might feel justified in their actions because they uncovered the infidelity. They also made a point of not being nosy without reason, unlike friends they mention. The author's note seems like a mature response compared to an angry confrontation. However, the act of snooping itself is still a violation of privacy, regardless of the outcome. \n\nLegal and ethical perspectives might differ. Legally, there's no law against it in most places unless it's corporate or government phones, but ethically, it's a gray area. Relationships often have unspoken rules about privacy. Even if the outcome was good (finding out about the cheating), the method might still be considered wrong by some. \n\nSome people might argue that open communication is better. Instead of snooping, the author could have talked more about the trust issues. Others might say that when trust is broken, taking action to protect oneself is necessary. \n\nThe author's justification is that they prevented future heartbreak, which is a valid concern. However, the act of snooping can lead to more conflict, as seen in the boyfriend's reaction. The key here is whether the means justify the ends. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention was to uncover the truth and protect themselves, the method involved a breach of privacy. Depending on one's values, the answer might vary. But considering the context\u2014there was a suspicion of cheating, and the author acted on a legitimate concern\u2014it's a complex situation where both sides have valid points. However, from a strict ethical standpoint, snooping is generally frowned upon, but the outcome (discovering infidelity) might mitigate some of the blame. The answer could lean towards B (not in the wrong) because their actions led to a necessary revelation, but it's a nuanced case.\n"
