A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned being in a depressive hole. The author felt something was off and decided to check his phone while he was asleep. They found out he was cheating. The author left a note and left, and the boyfriend later yelled at them for invading privacy and not trusting him.\n\nThe author argues that they aren't pro-snooping unless there's a real reason, unlike friends who do it out of nosiness. They feel they saved themselves from more heartbreak by doing it.\n\nHmm. On one side, privacy is important. Cheating is a big deal, but does snooping justify breaking trust? Even if the partner was cheating, the act of snooping without consent could be seen as violating trust. The boyfriend felt that the snoop proved a lack of trust, which might be valid. Trust is a two-way street in relationships. If you don't trust your partner, that's a problem. But if the partner is cheating, maybe the trust was already broken. But the act of snooping might have been the catalyst for the break-up, but was it the right way?\n\nAnother angle: maybe the author should have confronted the boyfriend first before snooping. But they had a gut feeling and tried to ask, but he didn't respond adequately. The author might have felt justified because they ended up finding the truth. However, the method of finding out was through invasion of privacy. So, while the outcome might be negative, the action itself is ethically questionable because it's a breach of trust and privacy.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction of yelling and calling the author a piece of shit is harsh, but maybe he's in the right to feel betrayed because of the snoop, even if he was cheating. The author's action might have escalated things, but the cheating is the real issue here. However, in terms of right and wrong, the snoop is a violation regardless of the outcome. So the author is in the wrong for snooping, even though the result was discovering a betrayal. Trust is foundational, and without prior consent, snooping is a breach. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
