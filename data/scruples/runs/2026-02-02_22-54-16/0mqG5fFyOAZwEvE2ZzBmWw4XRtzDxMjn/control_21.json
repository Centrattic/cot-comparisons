A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see. The situation is about a girlfriend who snoops through her boyfriend's phone because he was acting distant. She found out he was cheating and left a note instead of confronting him. He got angry and called her a piece of shit for invading his privacy.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethics here. Snooping on someone's phone without their consent is generally considered a privacy violation. Even if the intentions were to uncover something bad, the method was without permission. Trust in a relationship is important, and invading someone's privacy can break that trust. The author argues that she did it because she had a gut feeling something was wrong, not just out of being nosy. She also mentions that she saved herself future heartbreak. But the boyfriend felt that the snooping proved she didn't trust him, which led to the breakup.\n\nOn one hand, she discovered infidelity which might have continued if left unchecked. On the other hand, the act of snooping without trust is a breach of privacy. Some might say that even if the outcome was good, the action itself was wrong. Others might sympathize because she was trying to protect herself from a cheating partner. It's a bit of a tricky situation because both actions have valid points. But generally, respecting privacy is a key aspect in relationships. So, even though the result was beneficial for her, the method used could be seen as wrong. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the violation of privacy, regardless of the outcome.\n"
