A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author snooped through their partner's phone and found out he was cheating. The partner got angry about the snooping and called the author a bad name.\n\nThe author justifies their actions by saying they had a gut feeling something was wrong and that they were trying to avoid future heartbreak. They also mention that they aren't in favor of snooping unless there's a strong reason. They left a note instead of confronting him in person, which maybe shows they wanted to handle it calmly.\n\nOn one hand, snooping into someone's phone is generally considered a privacy violation. Trust is a big part of relationships, and checking a partner's phone without permission can be seen as a breach of trust. The partner's reaction\u2014calling the author a piece of shit\u2014highlights the hurt caused by the invasion of privacy. Even if the author found out about the cheating, the method they used might have contributed to the conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the author felt justified because they discovered infidelity. They argue that they acted to protect themselves from ongoing pain. The question is whether the means (snooping) are acceptable given the ends (discovering the cheating). Some might say that once the cheating is discovered, the real issue is the infidelity, not the method of discovery. Others might argue that the act of snooping still crosses a boundary, regardless of the outcome.\n\nThe author also differentiates themselves from friends who snoop for no reason, which adds context that their decision wasn't made lightly. But does that make it right? Trust is usually supposed to be the foundation of a relationship. If trust is broken because of cheating, does that make the snooping forgivable? Or does the act of breaking the trust by snooping make them equally at fault?\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. Legally, there's no issue, but morally and ethically, it's more complex. The key points are consent, trust, and the consequences of snooping. The partner felt betrayed by the snooping, which complicates things. Even if the author found out the truth, the way they did it might have caused additional harm.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the answer is A, then their snooping was wrong regardless of the outcome. If B, then it's understandable given the cheating. But since the act itself is a privacy violation, even if the result was justified, the action might still be considered wrong. The partner's reaction shows that the snooping hurt them, even if the truth was discovered. So, maybe the answer is A because the method was wrong, but the outcome was justified. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not whether the outcome was justified. Since the act of snooping without consent is generally considered a violation, the answer might be A.\n"
