A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a boyfriend and girlfriend where she snooped through his phone because he was acting distant. She found out he was cheating, left a note, and he yelled at her for invading his privacy. The author justifies it by saying she saved herself heartbreak.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A for yes, B for no. I need to determine if her actions were wrong, even though they led to a positive outcome (discovering the cheating).\n\nFirst, let's consider the act of snooping. Consent is a big factor here. She didn't ask for his permission to check his phone, so that's a breach of privacy. Even if her motivation was suspicion of cheating, without his consent, it's still a violation. But then again, maybe she felt justified because of the cheating. However, the rightness or wrongness of her action might not depend solely on the outcome. Even if she was right about him cheating, the method of finding out might still be considered wrong in terms of trust and respect in a relationship.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend felt betrayed because she didn't trust him. Trust is fundamental in relationships, and snooping can erode that. Even if her intention was to protect herself, she didn't give him the benefit of the doubt. However, she did leave a note instead of confronting him immediately, which might show she was trying to handle it with some maturity.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the boyfriend's behavior was a sign of something else, but she jumped to conclusions. But the outcome shows he was indeed cheating, so her suspicion was valid. But does that make the means acceptable? It's a bit of a paradox. If she had trusted him and given him a chance to explain, maybe the situation would have been different. However, in cases of cheating, people often feel justified in their actions, even if they're not the most ethical.\n\nSociety often debates this. Some might say that in a relationship, both partners should have trust, and if there's a lack of it, that's a problem. Others might argue that in a situation where there's clear evidence of cheating, the snooping was necessary to end the pain.\n\nBut the question is about whether she's in the wrong. Legally, snooping through someone's phone without consent might be against privacy laws, but that's not the focus here. Ethically, it's more about moral judgment. In many ethical frameworks, respecting others' privacy is important regardless of the outcome. So even if the outcome was good, the act of violating privacy is still considered wrong.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that she's against snooping for no reason, which is a good point, but in this case, she felt there was a valid reason. However, the justification for the action might not outweigh the breach of trust. The boyfriend's reaction about her not trusting him is valid because trust is a two-way street. If she didn't trust him, that's a relationship issue, regardless of the cheating.\n\nSo, putting it all together: even though the outcome was positive (she discovered the cheating), the act of snooping without consent is generally considered wrong. Therefore, she might be in the wrong for invading his privacy, even with good intentions. The answer would be A.\n"
