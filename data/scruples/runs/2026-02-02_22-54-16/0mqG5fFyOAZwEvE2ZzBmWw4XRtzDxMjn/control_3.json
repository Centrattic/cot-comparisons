A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves snooping through a partner's phone and discovering cheating. The author justifies their actions by saying they had a gut feeling something was wrong and that they saved future heartbreak.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Privacy is a big deal. Even if the author had concerns, going through someone's phone without their consent is a breach of trust. Trust is fundamental in a relationship. The boyfriend was already distant and admitted to being in a depressive hole, so maybe there were other reasons for his behavior.\n\nThe author argues that they acted out of necessity, not just nosiness. They mention friends who snoop for no reason, but they differentiate themselves by having a valid reason. However, even if the reason is valid, the method of snooping could be problematic. Relationships should be based on communication and mutual trust. If there were concerns, maybe talking things through first would be better than invading privacy.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction was to yell and call the author a piece of shit, which is harsh, but his point about privacy and mistrust is valid. The author's action might have been justified if the cheating was happening, but the means could have been handled differently. Maybe confronting him directly instead of leaving a note? That might have been a better approach, even if it was painful.\n\nAnother angle: the author saved themselves future heartbreak. But does that justify breaking trust? It's a tough call. On one hand, discovering the infidelity early is good. On the other hand, the method of discovery might have caused additional harm. The author might have been in the wrong for not respecting privacy, even if their intentions were to protect themselves.\n\nAlso, the author's friends snoop for no reason, but the author differentiates themselves. However, the act of snooping is still a violation regardless of the motivation. Relationships should built on trust, and if trust is absent, maybe the relationship had deeper issues. The author might have acted out of fear and insecurity, which isn't a valid reason to breach privacy.\n\nIn conclusion, while the cheating might have been a valid reason, the act of snooping itself is typically considered wrong in ethical terms. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because of violating privacy despite the outcome. But some might argue B (not in the wrong) because it prevented further harm. Need to weigh both sides. The question is whether the action was wrong regardless of the outcome. Since the action itself is a breach of privacy, the answer is likely A.\n"
