A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant and eventually admitted to being in a depressive hole, but the author found out he was cheating by checking his phone. The author left a note and left, then the boyfriend was upset about the privacy invasion. The author argues that they did it because they had a feeling something was wrong, not just out of nosiness, and it saved them future heartbreak.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Trust is a big part of a relationship. Snooping usually violates that trust. Even if there was a legitimate reason, like suspecting infidelity, the method of finding out through sneaking around can be seen as wrong. The boyfriend felt betrayed because the author didn't confront him directly, even though they later left a note. He called them a piece of shit, which is strong language, but maybe because he felt his privacy was invaded. \n\nThe author says they're against snooping without reason, which is a good point. They had a reason here\u2014distance and a gut feeling. But in relationships, communication is key. Instead of snooping, the author could have had a more direct conversation. However, the boyfriend didn't open up, so maybe the author felt they had no choice. \n\nOn the other hand, the act of snooping itself, regardless of the outcome, is a breach of privacy. Even if the discovery was true, the means might be considered wrong. The author's actions might have caused more immediate hurt, even if it saved future heartbreak. The question is whether the ends justify the means. \n\nDifferent perspectives here. Some might say that the author was justified because they were protecting themselves from a cheater. Others might say that trust should be maintained, and if there's suspicion, it's better to communicate rather than spy. The boyfriend's reaction shows that he valued his privacy, so the author's action hurt him even though he was in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer hinges on the balance between self-protection and respecting boundaries. The author might argue they did the right thing by leaving quickly, but the method of finding out was still a violation. So, depending on the ethical framework, there's a case for both sides. However, in most ethical discussions, violating someone's privacy is generally frowned upon, even if the outcome is positive. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for snooping, even with good intentions. But maybe not entirely? It's a tough call. The answer might be A, but some might say B. Need to consider common opinions. In AITA posts, usually, the person is considered in the wrong for snooping because it's a breach of trust. So likely A.\n"
