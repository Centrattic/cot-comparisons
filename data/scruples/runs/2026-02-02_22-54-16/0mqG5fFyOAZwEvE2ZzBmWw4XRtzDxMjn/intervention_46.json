A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately.

He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's boyfriend was distant and claimed he was in a depressive hole. The author, feeling something was off, snooped his phone while he was asleep and found out he was cheating. She left a note and left. He called her a piece of shit for invading his privacy and said that shows she didn't trust him. The author justifies her actions by saying she's against snooping unless there's a real reason, and she believes she saved herself future heartbreak.\n\nHmm. So, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's consider the factors.\n\nOn one hand, snooping through someone's phone is generally considered an invasion of privacy. Even in a relationship, people often expect some level of privacy. Trust is a big part of a relationship, and if the author didn't trust her partner's explanation and went through his phone without his consent, that could be seen as a breach of trust. But she had a reason\u2014she felt there was something wrong beyond just the initial explanation. The boyfriend was acting off, and she couldn't shake the feeling. Then she found evidence of cheating, which validates her suspicions.\n\nNow, if the author had done this without any reason, it would be different. But in this case, her intuition led her to uncover that her partner was unfaithful. The boyfriend is upset about the privacy breach, but the author feels she made the right call to end the relationship early. \n\nBut is the act of snooping itself wrong? Some might say that even if the outcome is justified, the means were unethical. Others might argue that when a partner is being deceptive and there's evidence of infidelity, the snooping was a necessary step to uncover the truth. \n\nThe author also distinguishes herself from friends who snoop for no reason, which she's against. So, she's trying to justify her actions as a last resort rather than mere nosiness. \n\nHowever, in relationships, communication is key. Instead of snooping, maybe the author should have had a more direct conversation, even though the boyfriend was distant. But if the partner was being evasive, that could make it harder. \n\nSo, the ethical dilemma here is between respecting privacy and protecting oneself from harm. The author's actions led to uncovering the truth, but the method involved a privacy violation. \n\nDifferent perspectives might lead to different answers. If the act of snooping is considered wrong regardless of the outcome, then answer A. If the outcome justifies the means, then answer B. \n\nIn some cultures or moral frameworks, privacy is paramount, so the answer would lean toward A. In others, where preventing emotional harm is prioritized, it might be B. \n\nThe author is not in the wrong because she had a legitimate reason and the snooping led to a justified end. She also left a note and ended the relationship, which shows she respected the situation. The boyfriend's reaction about not trusting him is hypocritical since he was the one who was unfaithful. \n\nSo, the answer is B.\n"
