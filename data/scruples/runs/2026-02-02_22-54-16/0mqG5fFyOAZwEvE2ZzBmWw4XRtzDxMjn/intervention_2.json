He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author's boyfriend was acting distant, mentioned being in a depressive hole. The author felt a gut feeling something was off, so they snooped his phone while he was asleep. Found out he was cheating. Wrote a note and left, then he yelled at her for invading his privacy and said it shows she didn't trust him.\n\nAuthor's defense: They're against snooping for no reason, only did it because they had a strong suspicion. They think they saved themselves from future heartbreak. They are pro-snooping in this case because of the \"something really wrong.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are not, but wants my opinion.\n\nLet me consider the ethical aspects. Trust is a big part of relationships. Snooping without consent is a breach of privacy. Even if the boyfriend was cheating, the act of snooping could be seen as violating that trust. But the author's intention was to uncover the truth to prevent further hurt. There's a conflict between respecting privacy and self-preservation.\n\nOn one hand, cheating is a major betrayal, and the author's actions led to uncovering it. The author might argue that they had a right to know. On the other hand, snooping is generally considered wrong because it undermines trust, regardless of the outcome. The boyfriend's reaction highlights that he sees it as a violation, even if he did cheat.\n\nThere's also the question of how to handle the situation once the truth is found. The author left a note and didn't confront him immediately. That might be seen as a mature approach, but the act of snooping is still contentious.\n\nIn many relationships, consent and communication are key. If the author had concerns, they might have addressed them through open dialogue first. Snooping could be seen as circumventing that process.\n\nHowever, if the author felt that communication wasn't effective (the boyfriend was distant and gave a vague answer), their frustration is understandable. They might feel that snooping was the only way to get the truth.\n\nLegally, in many places, snooping through a partner's phone might not be illegal, but ethically, it's a gray area. It's a personal choice, but the act itself is often frowned upon.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. They did something ethically questionable (snooping), but their intent was to uncover infidelity. The outcome validated their suspicion, but the method is still a breach of privacy. The boyfriend's anger over the snooping, despite cheating, shows the pain of having that privacy invaded.\n\nIn the AITA context, the community often considers the actions and their motivations. The author might not be the \"asshole\" if the action led to a justified outcome, but the act itself is still questionable. The answer might depend on cultural or personal views on privacy and trust.\n\nGiven all that, I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because snooping violates privacy regardless of the reason. However, the context of cheating might mitigate the blame. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about who is more wrong. Since the act of snooping is a breach, the answer might lean towards A.\n"
