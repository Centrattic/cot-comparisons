A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author's boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned being in a depressive hole. The author, sensing something's off, checks his phone while he's asleep and finds out he's cheating. She leaves a note and leaves, then he yells at her for invading his privacy and accuses her of not trusting him. She defends her actions by saying she did it because she felt something was really wrong, not just out of nosiness, and believes it saved her from future heartbreak.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. Trust is a big factor in relationships. Sneaking around to check someone's phone without their consent is a breach of privacy. Even if her intentions were to uncover the truth, the method was invasive. Relationships typically require mutual trust; if she didn't trust him enough, maybe the relationship had underlying issues. Cheating is a violation of the relationship itself, but the act of sifting through his phone without permission is another violation. \n\nHer friends snoop for no reason, but she distinguishes herself by acting on a \"gut feeling\" of something being wrong. However, even if there's a reason, bypassing someone's privacy can be seen as a betrayal. The boyfriend's reaction highlights the breach of trust from his perspective. He felt she didn't trust him, which adds another layer of conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, she did uncover cheating, which is a serious issue. She might argue she saved herself future pain. But the method of finding out is contentious. Some might say that in a healthy relationship, communication is key, and if trust is broken, it's the cheating partner's fault. However, the act of snooping itself is a violation, regardless of the outcome.\n\nDifferent cultures and individuals have varying views on privacy and trust. Legally, there's no right to another person's privacy in that way, but ethically, it's a gray area. The author's justification is that she had a valid reason, but the means were questionable.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the ends justify the means. In ethical terms, even with good intentions, violating someone's privacy is generally considered wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for snooping, even if the result was uncovering infidelity. The method used damaged trust and crossed a boundary, which is a key aspect of the situation.\n"
