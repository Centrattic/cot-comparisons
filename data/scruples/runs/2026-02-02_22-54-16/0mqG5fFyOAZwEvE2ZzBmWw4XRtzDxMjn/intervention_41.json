A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who snoop on their partner is in the wrong. The situation involves the boyfriend acting distant, leading the author to check his phone while he was asleep. They found evidence of cheating and left a note before leaving. The boyfriend then yelled at her for invading privacy and said it showed lack of trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Snooping into someone's phone is a privacy violation, which is generally considered wrong. However, the author had reasons\u2014feeling something was off and wanting to avoid future heartbreak. They mention they aren't pro-snooping unless there's a real suspicion, distinguishing themselves from friends who do it out of nosiness.\n\nOn one hand, trust is foundational in a relationship. If one partner feels the need to snoop, it might indicate underlying trust issues. The boyfriend felt betrayed not just by the cheating but by the invasion of privacy. Even if the outcome was finding the truth, the method could have caused additional harm.\n\nOn the other hand, the author believed they were saving themselves from prolonged emotional pain. They acted on a gut feeling that something was wrong, which turned out to be correct. The intention was to confront the issue rather than just being nosy. However, the act itself still breaches trust and privacy, regardless of the outcome.\n\nLegally and ethically, privacy rights are important. Even in relationships, individuals have the right to privacy. Snooping without consent is a violation. The justification here is that it uncovered infidelity, but that doesn't necessarily make the action right. The rightness of the action isn't determined by the outcome but by the action itself.\n\nThe author might argue that the ends justified the means, but in moral terms, that's a gray area. Trust must be mutual; if one party undermines it by snooping, it can cause irreparable damage. The boyfriend's reaction highlights the breach of trust. Even though the author left a note and didn't confront him immediately, the act of snooping was still invasive.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions were to protect themselves from future harm, the method used was ethically questionable. Privacy violations are generally wrong, and trust should be built on open communication rather than surveillance. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for snooping, even if the outcome was beneficial.\n"
