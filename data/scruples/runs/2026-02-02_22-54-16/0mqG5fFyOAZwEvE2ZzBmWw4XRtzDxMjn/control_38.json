A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned being in a depressive hole. The author snoop his phone while he was asleep and discovered he was cheating. They left a note and left, then he yelled at them for invading privacy and said it shows a lack of trust.\n\nThe author justifies their actions by saying they had a gut feeling something was wrong, unlike friends who snoop just out of nosiness. They believe they saved themselves future heartbreak by finding out early.\n\nNow, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Let's consider the ethical aspects. Snooping without consent is a breach of privacy, regardless of the reason. Even if there were suspicions of cheating, the act of invading someone's privacy can be hurtful. Trust is a big part of relationships, and if trust is broken by cheating, but the response (snooping) also breaks trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had a legitimate reason based on their partner's behavior. They didn't snoop out of mere curiosity. However, the right to privacy is important. Even if the partner was unfaithful, the method of discovery might affect how the situation is handled. The boyfriend's reaction of yelling and calling them a \"piece of shit\" might indicate his own issues, but that doesn't exonerate the author.\n\nThere's a balance between being proactive about one's well-being and respecting boundaries. The author might argue that the snooping was necessary self-preservation, but others might say they should have addressed the issue directly first, maybe through conversation instead of covert action.\n\nIn many discussions about such situations, the consensus often leans towards disapproving of snooping because it undermines trust and respect. Even with good intentions, the means of discovering the infidelity might be seen as problematic. The author's decision to leave a note and leave without confronting him in the moment could also be viewed as abrupt, contributing to the conflict.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's actions are ethically questionable. While the outcome (discovering the cheating) might be justified, the method (snooping) typically isn't. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
