A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves snooping through their partner's phone and discovering an affair, then leaving without confronting them directly.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author snoopeds the boyfriend's phone after noticing he was distant and acting off. They found evidence of cheating. Instead of confronting him face-to-face, they left a note and later got yelled at for invading privacy. The author defends their actions by saying they had a gut feeling and that snooping was justified to avoid future heartbreak, contrasting with friends who snoop out of nosiness.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. Privacy is a significant factor here. Even in a relationship, individuals have a right to privacy. Snooping without consent breaches that trust. The author acknowledges they were wrong in the past when others snooped out of nosiness but justifies their own actions as necessary due to suspicion. However, the act of sneaking around to check someone's phone, regardless of the reason, is generally seen as a violation of trust. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also telling. He felt the snooping invalidated his trust in the author, which is a valid perspective. The author left abruptly, which might have caused additional emotional harm. The question is whether the means justified the ends. While the outcome (discovering the cheating) was negative, the method used could be seen as unethical. Trust is foundational in relationships, and breaking that by snooping, even with good intentions, can be damaging. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they were protecting themselves from prolonged deceit. However, the appropriate action would typically be to confront the partner directly, even if it's uncomfortable. Leaving a note and not discussing it face-to-face might have made the situation worse. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, many would say that snooping is a violation of privacy, regardless of the reason. The fact that the author did it when the partner was asleep adds to the underhanded nature of the act. So, while the outcome might have been a good one (ending a toxic relationship), the action itself is ethically questionable. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong for snooping, even if their intentions were to protect themselves. The breach of privacy and trust is a key factor here, so the answer would be A.\n"
