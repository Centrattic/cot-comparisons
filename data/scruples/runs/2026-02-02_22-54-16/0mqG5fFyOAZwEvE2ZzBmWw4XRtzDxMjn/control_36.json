A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone and discovering their infidelity. The answer options are A (yes, they're wrong) or B (no, they're not). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned being in a depressive hole. The author felt something was wrong, so they snooped his phone while he was asleep. They found evidence of him cheating. The author left a note and left, then the boyfriend called and yelled, accusing them of not trusting him. The author defends their action by saying they acted out of concern and saved themselves future heartbreak.\n\nNow, considering ethics and relationships. Trust and privacy are key components in a relationship. Snooping without consent, even if done with the intention of uncovering betrayal, is generally seen as a violation of privacy. However, the context matters. The boyfriend was already emotionally distant and had a depressive phase, which might be linked to his infidelity. The author might argue that they were protecting themselves from further harm by not staying in a deceitful relationship.\n\nBut from a relationship advice perspective, most people would say that trust is fundamental. If you don't have trust, the relationship is already strained. However, the act of snooping is still a breach of privacy. Even if the outcome was justified (finding out the truth), the means were questionable. The boyfriend was upset because he felt his privacy was invaded, which is a valid concern. The author's friends snooping for no reason is a contrast, but the author's case was different due to the suspected infidelity.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, many would consider snooping a red flag. Relationships should be built on open communication. If there were concerns about the partner's behavior, discussing it directly, perhaps with the help of a counselor, would be the recommended approach. However, the author's action led to a quicker resolution, avoiding prolonged emotional damage. The dilemma here is between immediate privacy violation and long-term trust issues.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If we go by the act of snooping itself, regardless of the outcome, the answer would be A. But considering the outcome (cheating was happening) and the author's reasoning (self-preservation), some might argue B. However, in most ethical frameworks, the violation of privacy is still a wrong action, even if it leads to a justified result. So the answer would be A. The author acted unethically by snooping, even if it revealed the truth. The fact that the boyfriend was cheating doesn't negate the act of invading privacy. The author's justification is that they saved themselves heartbreak, but the method is still considered wrong in most contexts.\n"
