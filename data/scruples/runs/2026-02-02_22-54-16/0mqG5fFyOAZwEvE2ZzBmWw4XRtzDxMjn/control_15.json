A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who snoop on their partner's phone is in the wrong. The scenario is that the boyfriend was acting distant, the person suspects something's wrong, and finds out he's cheating. They left a note and left, then the boyfriend yelled at them for invading his privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the morality and ethics here. Cheating is a big deal, and finding out about it can be really hurtful. The person did snoop, which is generally seen as a violation of privacy. But their reasoning is that they wanted to protect themselves from future heartbreak. \n\nOn one hand, snooping without consent is a breach of trust. Even if the partner was acting distant, going through their phone is a privacy issue. The boyfriend felt that this action proved a lack of trust, which makes sense because trust is a cornerstone of relationships. \n\nOn the other hand, the person felt they had a valid reason\u2014they suspected infidelity and wanted to confirm it. They didn't confront him immediately, which might show they were trying to handle it calmly. They did leave a note, so maybe they wanted to avoid a confrontation but still make him aware. \n\nBut the key point is whether the means justified the ends. Even though the outcome was them leaving a cheating partner, the method of finding out was through snooping. Some might argue that trust should be given even in difficult times, and that if the partner was unfaithful, they should have been honest. Others might say that in cases of suspected betrayal, self-preservation is important, and the person acted to protect themselves.\n\nI also need to consider cultural or societal norms. In many contexts, snooping is frowned upon regardless of the reason. However, there's also empathy for someone who's been cheated on. The person might feel justified because they avoided prolonged emotional pain.\n\nBut ultimately, the act of snooping is a violation of privacy. Even if the result was positive for the person, the action itself is ethically questionable. The boyfriend's reaction about broken trust is valid because without trust, a relationship can't function. The person's friends snooping for no reason is different from their case, but it doesn't make their action right. \n\nSo, balancing the violation of privacy against the valid reason of discovering infidelity, I think the author is in the wrong because they broke trust through snooping. Even if the outcome was beneficial for them, the method was unethical. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
