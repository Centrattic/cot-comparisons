A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The author found out their boyfriend was cheating by looking at his phone, then left a note and left. The boyfriend was upset about the privacy invasion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that their boyfriend was acting distant and had been in a depressive hole. The author felt a gut feeling something was wrong, which led to them snooping. They found evidence of cheating. The key points here are the reason for the snooping and the outcome.\n\nOn one hand, snooping without permission is generally considered a violation of privacy. Trust is a big part of relationships, and invading someone's privacy can damage that trust, even if there's a reason. The boyfriend's reaction highlights this\u2014feeling that the lack of trust was the real issue. So, the act of snooping itself is ethically questionable because it breaches consent and privacy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had a legitimate reason to suspect something was wrong, given the partner's behavior. They didn't snoop out of mere curiosity but because they had concerns. The result was that they uncovered infidelity, which might have saved them from ongoing heartache. The author isn't pro-snooping for no reason, which adds some nuance.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Even if the outcome was positive (discovering the cheating), the action was a privacy violation. The boyfriend was upset because he felt his privacy was invaded, which is a valid feeling. The author's actions, while possibly motivated by valid concerns, still cross a boundary. So, while the outcome might justify the means in the author's eyes, the act itself is ethically wrong in terms of respecting boundaries and privacy. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
