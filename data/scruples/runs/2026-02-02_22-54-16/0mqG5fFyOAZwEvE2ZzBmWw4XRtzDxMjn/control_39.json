A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario did the wrong thing by snooping through their partner's phone. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, cheating is a big deal. The boyfriend was indeed cheating, as discovered by the author. But the method of finding this out involved snooping, which is a privacy violation. The author mentions that they had a good reason because they sensed something was wrong and the partner was distant. They also differentiate themselves from friends who snoop out of nosiness, which adds context.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, cheating is unethical and harmful, so discovering it and leaving is justified. On the other, snooping without consent breaches trust. Even if the result was justified, the means involved invading privacy. The partner was upset about the lack of trust, which is valid because trust is crucial in a relationship. The author might argue that their actions saved them future heartbreak, but the act of snooping can't be ignored. Relationships require mutual respect and trust, and breaking that by snooping, regardless of the outcome, is problematic. So, even though the partner cheated, the author's method of finding out is ethically questionable. So the answer is A.\n"
