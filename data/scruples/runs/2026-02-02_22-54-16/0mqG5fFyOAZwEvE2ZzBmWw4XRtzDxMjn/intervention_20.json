A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's think about this. The user is asking whether the person who snoop through their partner's phone is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant and then the person found out he was cheating by checking his phone.\n\nFirst, the act of snooping itself is usually considered a violation of privacy. Even if the person had a reason to suspect something was wrong, going through someone's phone without consent is generally seen as crossing a boundary. Trust is a big part of relationships, and if the author didn't trust their partner, that's an issue. But the boyfriend had already lied about his reasons for being distant, which might add context.\n\nThe author left a note and left, which shows they tried to handle it calmly, but the boyfriend reacted angrily. The author justifies their actions by saying they prevented future heartbreak. However, the ethical question here is about whether the means (snooping) justify the end (discovering the cheating). \n\nOn one hand, cheating is a betrayal, and the author might not have known unless they snooped. On the other hand, respecting privacy is important, and snooping can lead to bigger issues. The author mentions they're against casual snooping, which might suggest they saw a justified reason here, but does that make it right? \n\nDifferent people have different views on this. Some might say that in a healthy relationship, there shouldn't be a need to snoop, and that if trust is broken, it's the partner's fault. Others might argue that the author acted out of self-preservation and clarity. \n\nI think the answer depends on how you weigh privacy against the consequences of not knowing the truth. The boyfriend's cheating is definitely wrong, but the act of snooping is still a breach of trust. So the author is in the wrong for snooping, but the situation is complex. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the act itself is a violation, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong), but there's nuance.\n"
