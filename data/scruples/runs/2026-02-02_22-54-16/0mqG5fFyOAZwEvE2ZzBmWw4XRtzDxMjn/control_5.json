A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for snooping on their partner's phone and finding out he was cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions their boyfriend was acting distant and had mentioned being in a depressive hole. The author felt a gut feeling something was wrong and decided to check his phone while he was asleep. They found evidence of cheating, left a note, and left. The boyfriend was angry about the privacy invasion, but the author believes they were justified because cheating was discovered.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether snooping into a partner's phone without consent is wrong, even if it leads to uncovering infidelity. \n\nIn relationships, trust is a big component. Cheating is a violation of that trust. However, snooping is also a violation of privacy. Even if there are suspicions, going through someone's phone without permission is generally considered a breach of privacy. \n\nBut the author argues that they didn't do it out of nosiness but because they sensed something was really wrong. They also mention they didn't act out of spite but to save future heartbreak. \n\nLegally, privacy laws might consider this a violation, but the ethical question is more nuanced. Some might say that if a partner is unfaithful, they've already broken the relationship's core, and the snooping was a way to expose that. Others might say that the right approach is to confront the partner directly if there are suspicions, rather than snoop.\n\nThe author also contrasts their action with friends who snoop out of nosiness, which they are against. They justify their action because it led to uncovering a betrayal. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend's reaction was anger over the privacy invasion. The author's action, while possibly revealing a problem, was done without consent. So, even if the outcome was beneficial for the author, the act itself is ethically questionable. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, the means can affect the morality of the action. Even if the result was good, the method might still be wrong. So, the author is in the wrong for the act of snooping, even if the outcome was revealing a betrayal. \n\nBut there's also the argument that in a relationship where trust is already compromised due to cheating, the snooping was a necessary step to uncover the truth. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nOn one hand, snooping is a breach of privacy. On the other, the cheating is a more significant betrayal. The question is whether the author's action was justified given the circumstances. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because snooping is generally considered a violation of privacy, even if it leads to discovering a betrayal. The right approach would have been to communicate openly, not snoop. So, I would say A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
