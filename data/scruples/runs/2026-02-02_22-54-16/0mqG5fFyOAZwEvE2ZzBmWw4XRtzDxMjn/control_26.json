A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant, and when asked, he said he was in a depressive hole. The author, feeling a gut instinct, checked his phone while he was asleep and found out he had a girl on the side. Then left a note and left, and the boyfriend was upset about the privacy invasion.\n\nHmm, the question is whether the author was wrong. So, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, snooping into someone's phone without their consent is generally a violation of privacy, which is a big deal. Even if there were suspicions of cheating, invading privacy might not be the right approach. Trust is important in relationships, and snooping can break that trust, even if the person ends up being right.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author mentions that they had a legitimate reason and a gut feeling that something was wrong. They also differentiate themselves from people who snoop out of mere nosiness. The outcome was that they found out about the cheating, which saved them from further heartbreak. The author's intention was to protect themselves from future pain, which is understandable.\n\nI need to weigh the violation of privacy against the consequences. While the action was unethical, the outcome was that the author avoided being cheated on. However, the act of snooping itself is still an issue because it's about trust and consent. Relationships require mutual trust, and if one person feels the need to snoop, it can cause damage even if the other was unfaithful.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction was to yell and call them a piece of shit, which is not helpful. But that doesn't excuse the author's actions. The question is about whether the author was wrong, not the boyfriend's response. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, respecting others' privacy is a fundamental right, regardless of the situation. So even if the author had a good reason, the act itself was a breach. However, some might argue that in cases of potential betrayal, the self-preservation is understandable. But self-preservation shouldn't override respecting boundaries unless there's explicit consent or other valid legal reasons.\n\nAdditionally, the author could have approached the situation differently. Instead of snooping, maybe having a direct conversation or seeking couples counseling to address the distance and concerns. Snooping might have been a shortcut that caused immediate conflict and could have made the situation worse.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions were a breach of trust and privacy, even if motivated by a desire to uncover the truth. Therefore, they are in the wrong.\n"
