A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone and discovering an affair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that their boyfriend was acting distant and seemed depressed. They had a gut feeling something was wrong, so they snoop while he's asleep and find out he's cheating. The author then leaves a note and leaves. The boyfriend reacts angrily, accusing them of mistrust.\n\nThe key points here are the justification for snooping. The author isn't doing it out of casual curiosity but because they sensed something was off. They distinguish themselves from friends who snoop without reason. They argue that they saved themselves heartbreak by acting sooner rather than later.\n\nNow, the ethical dilemma here is about privacy versus trust. Most people would agree that snooping is generally a violation of privacy. However, the situation is complicated by the cheating. The author's actions led to uncovering infidelity, which is a betrayal. So, is the snooping wrong in this case?\n\nFrom one angle, trust in a relationship is built on mutual respect for each other's privacy. Snooping, even with \"good\" intentions, breaks that trust. The boyfriend's anger might stem from feeling that his privacy was invaded, regardless of the infidelity.\n\nOn the other hand, the author felt that the cheating was a more significant violation, and by discovering it early, they avoided prolonged emotional pain. Some might argue that the ends justify the means here. However, others might say that the method (snooping) was still wrong, even if the outcome was negative for the partner.\n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. The author tried to ask the boyfriend what was wrong but didn't get a truthful answer. This lack of communication could be a factor. If the boyfriend was hiding the affair, maybe he was in denial or unwilling to confront the issue, so the author's action forced the truth to come out.\n\nBut the core issue is whether the means (snooping) were justified. In many ethical discussions, the violation of privacy is considered a serious matter. Even if the outcome was beneficial, the act itself is generally seen as wrong. So, while the author's intentions might be understandable, the action itself is ethically questionable because it breaches trust and privacy.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because snooping violates the partner's privacy, and trust in a relationship should be based on honesty rather than surveillance. Even though the outcome revealed cheating, the method used was ethically wrong.\n"
