A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant, the writer checked his phone while he was asleep, found out he was cheating, left a note, and then the boyfriend yelled at her for invading his privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects here. Snooping through someone's phone without their consent is generally a privacy violation, which can be a big deal in relationships. Trust is a key component in any partnership, and if you're not trusting enough to check their phone, that could lead to issues. But on the other hand, the writer mentions that they had a gut feeling something was wrong, and their action led to uncovering infidelity. \n\nI should think about the reasons behind the snooping. The user isn't just being nosy; they had a valid reason to suspect something was wrong, like the boyfriend's distance and depressive behavior. However, the method of handling it\u2014snooping without communication\u2014might be problematic. Instead of confronting him directly, they chose to check his phone, which could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction is important here. He accused her of not trusting him, which is a common point in these situations. The writer argues that they acted out of self-preservation to avoid future heartbreak. But does that justify the violation of privacy? There's a balance between self-protection and respecting boundaries. \n\nLegal perspectives might differ, but morally, it's more about the relationship dynamics. Even if the outcome was good (discovering the cheating), the means might still be considered wrong. Some might say that trust should be given, and if there's a suspicion, it's better to talk rather than snoop. \n\nAdditionally, the writer mentions that they are against casual snooping but did it here because of the situation. The line between justified and unjustified snooping is blurry. However, the fact that they left a note and didn't confront him immediately might have added to the boyfriend's sense of betrayal.\n\nIn summary, while the writer's intentions might be understandable, the act of snooping without discussing the concerns first could be seen as breaching trust. The key factors are consent, communication, and the impact on the relationship. Even though the outcome was beneficial for the writer, the method used might still place the blame on them.\n"
