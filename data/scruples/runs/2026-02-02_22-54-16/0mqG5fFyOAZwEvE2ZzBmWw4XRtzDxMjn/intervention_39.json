A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for snooping on their partner's phone. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant and the author found out he was cheating through snooping. The author left a note and left, and the boyfriend reacted angrily, saying they didn't trust him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, snooping is a violation of privacy. Trust in a relationship is crucial, and invading someone's privacy without consent can be seen as a breach of that trust. Even if the author had good intentions, the act of snooping might be ethically questionable because it's about privacy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author felt that something was wrong and couldn't shake the feeling. They mention that they aren't pro-snooping unless it's really necessary, and they differentiate themselves from friends who snoop out of mere nosiness. The author's intention was to uncover the truth to prevent prolonged heartbreak. They did confront the issue, and it turned out they were right. The cheating was confirmed, so the snoop led to a painful but necessary truth.\n\nBut does that justify the action? Some might argue that trust is a two-way street. If the author had a gut feeling, maybe they should have had an open conversation first instead of resorting to snooping. However, if the partner was already secretive, that could be seen as a red flag. The boyfriend's reaction was to yell and blame the author, which might indicate he was guilty and didn't want to face the truth directly.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. The author felt the need to leave immediately, which might have been their way of dealing with the situation. But by snooping, they acted on suspicion rather than evidence. Even though they were right, the method used could have repercussions on mutual respect in the relationship.\n\nLegally, there might not be many implications, but ethically, it's a gray area. The author's action was based on a feeling, and while it turned out to be correct, it's not always the case. If they had been wrong, the breach of privacy could have caused unnecessary harm. So, the justification of the action depends on the outcome here.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The fact that the boyfriend was distant and didn't open up might have contributed to the author's decision. But still, snooping is a violation of privacy. Even with good intentions, it's a breach that can damage trust, which the boyfriend used to accuse the author of not trusting him.\n\nIn summary, the author's action was a violation of privacy, which is generally considered wrong. However, the context of the cheating adds complexity. But in terms of morality, breaking someone's privacy isn't justified, regardless of the outcome. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because the act of snooping is a violation of privacy, even if it led to uncovering the truth.\n"
