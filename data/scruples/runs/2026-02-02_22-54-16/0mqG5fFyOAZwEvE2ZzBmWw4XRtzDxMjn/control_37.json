A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone and leaving a note before leaving. \n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The author noticed their boyfriend was acting distant and claimed to be in a depressive hole. The author then snooped the phone while he was asleep, found evidence of cheating, left a note, and left. The boyfriend was upset about the privacy invasion.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, snooping is generally considered a violation of privacy. Trust is a big part of relationships, and snooping can break that trust. The boyfriend felt betrayed because of the privacy invasion, which is a valid reaction. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had a reason\u2014they suspected something was wrong beyond just being distant. They mention friends who snoop without reason, distinguishing themselves. The author felt it was necessary to prevent future heartbreak. They didn't confront the boyfriend immediately but left a note, which might be seen as a mature decision to avoid an argument in the moment. \n\nBut the main ethical issue is whether the means justified the ends. Even if the result was positive (ending a cheating relationship), the act of snooping itself is still a breach of privacy. Relationships require mutual trust, and without that trust, the foundation is shaky. The author's actions might have been driven by valid concerns, but the method used is ethically questionable.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction about the privacy violation being a deal-breaker adds another layer. Even if the author discovered the truth, the way they did it could be seen as wrong regardless of the outcome. \n\nIn some perspectives, the author might argue that they acted out of self-preservation, but others would say that trust should be earned, and not violated even if suspicion exists. There's also the aspect of communication\u2014maybe discussing the concerns first would have been better than snooping.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author's actions, while possibly motivated by valid concerns, still violated the partner's privacy. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the act of snooping itself is a breach, regardless of the outcome.\n"
