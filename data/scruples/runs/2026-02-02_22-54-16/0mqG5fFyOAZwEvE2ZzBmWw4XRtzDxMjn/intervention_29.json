A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The question is whether snooping through a partner's phone is justified, especially when there are reasons to suspect something's wrong. The author found out their boyfriend was cheating, so they left a note and left. The boyfriend reacted angrily, accusing them of not trusting him. The author defends their actions by saying they acted on a gut feeling and to prevent future heartbreak.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. On one hand, snooping is generally considered a breach of privacy. Even if the intentions are good, invading someone's privacy can be seen as a violation of trust in the relationship. Relationships usually require mutual trust, and if you don't trust your partner, that's a big issue. So by snooping, the author might be undermining the foundation of trust, even if their actions later proved right.\n\nOn the other hand, the author mentions that they had a reason to be concerned\u2014partner was acting distant, and they had a gut feeling. They also contrast themselves with friends who snoop out of nosiness without cause. The author argues that their action saved them from future pain, which could be seen as self-preservation. But does that justify breaking trust?\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also a point. He felt betrayed because of the snooping, even though he was cheating. But his anger might stem from the fact that he was discovered through invasive means, not just the cheating itself. So both parties might have issues here. The author's right to know versus the partner's right to privacy. But in a healthy relationship, trust should be there. If the partner was cheating, that's a betrayal, but the snooping is another form of betrayal in reverse.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, honesty and trust are foundational. If you can't trust your partner, the relationship is already in trouble. The act of snooping might not be the root problem, but the lack of communication. The author could have addressed the distance and concerns directly instead of resorting to snooping.\n\nBut from another angle, if the partner was indeed cheating, the author acted to protect themselves. However, the method of discovery might not change the fact that cheating is still wrong. The question is not about the cheating, but about the snooping. Even if justified, it's still an action that breaches privacy. So maybe the answer is A (in the wrong) because of violating privacy, even with good intentions. But others might argue B because it led to a necessary outcome. It's a tough call.\n"
