A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about snooping through a partner's phone. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned being in a depressive hole. The author couldn't shake the feeling something was wrong, so they checked his phone while he was asleep and found out he was cheating. They left a note and left, and the boyfriend was angry about the privacy invasion.\n\nThe author defends their actions by saying they had a reason\u2014they felt something was seriously wrong, not just being nosy. They also mention they're against snooping without a good reason. Their argument is that they prevented future heartbreak by uncovering the cheating early.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, snooping through someone's phone is a breach of privacy, which is generally considered respectful to avoid. On the other hand, the author had a suspicion based on the boyfriend's behavior and found evidence of cheating. The boyfriend was already cheating, so the author's action led to the truth coming out, which might have saved the relationship from more pain later.\n\nBut even if the boyfriend was cheating, the act of snooping is still a violation of trust and privacy. The author's decision to leave a note instead of confronting him immediately might have been an attempt to handle it calmly, but the initial act of checking the phone without consent is still ethically questionable. The boyfriend's reaction about the lack of trust is valid because snooping, regardless of the outcome, can be seen as a breach of that trust.\n\nThe author argues that they did it to save themselves heartbreak, which is understandable. But the means\u2014without consent\u2014might not justify the end. There's no clear right or wrong here, but generally, respecting privacy is important. Even in cases of suspicion, communication and trust are usually the preferred approaches. Snooping can be seen as a violation, even if the motive is to uncover the truth.\n\nSo, while the author's intent might be understandable, the action itself is typically considered wrong because it violates privacy. Therefore, the answer would lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
