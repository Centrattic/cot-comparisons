A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone and discovering an affair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned being in a depressive hole. The author felt something was wrong and decided to check his phone while he was asleep. They found evidence of him cheating and left a note before leaving. The boyfriend reacted angrily, saying he felt his privacy was invaded and that the author didn't trust him.\n\nThe author argues that they snoop because they had a strong feeling something was wrong, unlike friends who do it out of nosiness. They believe they saved themselves from future heartbreak by finding out early.\n\nNow, the ethical question here is about privacy versus justified suspicion. Generally, snooping is considered a breach of trust and privacy, even if done out of concern. Trust is foundational in a relationship, and invading someone's privacy, regardless of the intent, can be seen as a violation. The boyfriend's reaction highlights this, as he felt betrayed by the lack of trust.\n\nHowever, the author's motivation was based on a real issue\u2014the partner was cheating. The question is whether the means justify the ends. Even if the outcome was good (avoiding continued heartbreak), the act of snooping itself is ethically questionable. It's possible that open communication could have addressed the issues without resorting to privacy invasion. \n\nBut then, if the partner was already cheating, maybe the author is just taking a proactive step to end a harmful situation. Still, relationships should be built on mutual respect and trust. Snooping undermines that trust, even if the outcome is positive. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, the action's morality isn't just about the result but the action itself. So, despite the good outcome, the act of snooping is still wrong because it breaches privacy. However, some might argue that the author had a valid reason due to the cheating, making their action a necessary evil.\n\nBut the problem is that the author didn't confront the partner first. They could have had a conversation about the distance and concerns. Snooping bypasses that step. So even though the result was good, the method was flawed.\n\nI think the answer leans towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because invading someone's privacy, regardless of the reason, is generally considered unethical. Trust is essential in a relationship, and the act of snooping can cause lasting damage. However, there's a counter-argument that the cheating was the real issue. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for their action, not the cheating. Since the cheating is the partner's fault, the act of snooping is still the author's wrongdoing.\n"
