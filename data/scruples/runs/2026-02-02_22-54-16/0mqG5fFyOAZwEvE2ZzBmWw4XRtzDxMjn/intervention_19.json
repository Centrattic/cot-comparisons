A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The person is in a relationship and their partner started acting distant. They asked, got a vague response about being in a depressive hole, but then decided to snoop through the partner's phone while they were asleep. They found out the partner was cheating, left a note, and left. The partner then yelled at them for invading privacy and not trusting him. The author argues that snooping was justified because they had a gut feeling something was wrong and they wanted to save future heartbreak.\n\nFirst, the question is about whether snooping is wrong. I know that generally, privacy is a big deal. Even in relationships, people are expected to have boundaries. So invading someone's privacy without their consent could be seen as a breach of trust. The author mentions that they aren't pro-snooping unless there's a reason, which is a bit of a defense. But the partner's reaction was anger and calling them a piece of shit, which is harsh, but maybe not entirely unjustified.\n\nOn the other hand, the author found out about the infidelity, which is a major betrayal. They argue that leaving early saved them from more heartbreak. So maybe the action was necessary in this case. But the method of discovering it through snooping is where the conflict lies. Some might say that even if the partner was cheating, the way to find out is by confronting them or building trust, not snooping. Others might empathize with the author because they were dealing with a cheating partner and wanted to protect themselves.\n\nThe key points here are consent and trust. Snooping without consent is a violation, but the partner was already cheating. The author's intention was to protect themselves. However, trust is a foundational element in relationships, and breaking that by snooping could have consequences. Even if the partner was cheating, the act of snooping can be seen as wrong because it's a privacy violation. But maybe in this case, the partner's actions (cheating) were the real issue, and the author's snooping was a last resort.\n\nAnother angle is the partner's reaction. They called the author a piece of shit for invading privacy. That's hurtful, but the partner was the one cheating. However, the author's action of snooping might have exacerbated the situation. The author might feel justified because they were the victim of cheating, but the method of uncovering it is still ethically questionable.\n\nI think there's a gray area here. While the partner was cheating, which is definitely wrong, the act of snooping without consent is a breach of privacy. So the author is in the wrong in terms of their actions, even if the outcome was justified. However, some might argue that the partner's cheating makes the author's actions understandable. But from an ethical standpoint, violating someone's privacy is generally considered wrong, regardless of the outcome. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
