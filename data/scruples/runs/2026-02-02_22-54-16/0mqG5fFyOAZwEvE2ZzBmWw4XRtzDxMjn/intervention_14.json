A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned being in a depressive hole. The author, feeling something was off, checked his phone while he was asleep and found out he was cheating. She then left a note and left, and he yelled at her for invading his privacy and not trusting him.\n\nThe key points here are the intent behind the snooping and the consequences. The author mentions that they aren't pro-snooping just out of nosiness but in this case felt it was necessary due to the gut feeling and the partner's behavior. She also states that she found out the truth and avoided future heartbreak.\n\nNow, from a relationship ethics standpoint, privacy is important. Trust is a two-way street. Even if the partner was cheating, the act of snooping without consent is a violation of privacy. However, the context matters. The author had reasons to suspect infidelity based on behavior and the gut feeling, which led her to act. Some might argue that her actions were justified because she uncovered betrayal. Others might say that trust should be assumed, and snooping undermines that trust regardless of the outcome.\n\nBut in relationships, mutual trust is crucial. Cheating is a betrayal, but so is snooping. However, the person who cheated initiated the betrayal first. The author's action was a response to suspected betrayal. The debate here is whether the means (snooping) were justified by the ends (discovering infidelity).\n\nLegally, snooping into someone's phone is generally not illegal, but ethically it's a gray area. Different people have different views on this. Some might say that the emotional pain of being cheated on is worse than the privacy violation, so the author's actions were understandable. Others might argue that privacy should be respected even in the face of suspicion.\n\nThe author's justification is that she saved herself future heartbreak, which is a valid point. However, the boyfriend felt that her actions proved she didn't trust him. Trust is foundational in relationships, and if one party feels the other doesn't trust them, it can lead to conflict. But in this case, the cheating was the initial betrayal. The author's snooping was a reaction to that betrayal.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, she violated his privacy. On the other, he violated trust by cheating. The wrong here is a bit ambiguous. The question is whether the wrong of snooping outweighs the wrong of cheating. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. Some might say she was within her right to check, especially if she had suspicions. Others might say that trust should be given, and snooping is a breach of that trust.\n\nIn conclusion, while the boyfriend's cheating is clearly wrong, the act of snooping is ethically questionable. However, given the context, some might argue that the author's actions were justified as a necessary step to uncover the infidelity. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because her intent was to find the truth, which she did, and it led her to end a harmful situation. But others might still say A (in the wrong) because privacy was violated regardless of the outcome.\n"
