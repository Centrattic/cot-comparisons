A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone and finding out about an affair. First, I need to consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, snooping through someone's phone without consent is a clear invasion of privacy. Trust is a fundamental part of any relationship, and breaking that trust by secretly checking a partner's phone could be seen as a violation. The boyfriend felt betrayed because the author didn't trust him, and his reaction was to yell and call her a \"piece of shit.\" That's pretty harsh, but his anger might stem from feeling disrespected and having his privacy breached.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had reasons to suspect something was wrong. The boyfriend was distant and in a depressive hole, which could be genuine, but the author had a gut feeling. The outcome was that the author discovered the cheating, which saved her from further heartbreak. She mentions she's against snooping unless there's a strong reason, and she's glad she did it in this case. Her friends snoop without reason, but she thinks that's nosy. So she differentiates between her case and others.\n\nNow, I need to weigh the violation of privacy against the justification of uncovering infidelity. If the boyfriend was indeed cheating, then the author might feel she acted in self-preservation. However, the method of discovering it through snooping is questionable. Trust issues in a relationship can lead to such actions, but it's a two-way street. The boyfriend's behavior (being distant, not being honest) contributed to the situation. But does that justify the snooping? Maybe not. The right approach might have been to confront the issue directly or seek counseling instead of invading privacy.\n\nAlso, the author left a note and didn't confront him immediately. That might have been an attempt to avoid a heated argument, but the act of snooping itself is still problematic. The boyfriend's reaction highlights the breach of trust and privacy. Even if the outcome was positive, the means were ethically questionable. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of snooping, addressing the concerns openly might have been the healthier approach. While the author's intention was to protect herself from future pain, the method used could be seen as wrong because it undermined the relationship's foundation of trust. So, even though the outcome worked out for her, the act of snooping without consent is generally considered wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
