A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant, and after snooping, the author found out he was cheating. They left a note and left, but the boyfriend was upset about the privacy invasion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, snooping someone's phone without their consent is a clear invasion of privacy. Trust is a big part of relationships, and this action might be seen as breaking that trust. The boyfriend's reaction about not being trusted could hold some weight here.\n\nOn the other hand, the author mentions they had a genuine suspicion and a gut feeling something was wrong. They also differentiate themselves from friends who snoop out of mere nosiness. The author's reasoning is that they wanted to avoid prolonged heartbreak by confronting the situation early. They did leave a note instead of confronting him immediately, which might be a sign of trying to handle it respectfully.\n\nNow, the question is whether the means justify the ends. Did the snooping validate their suspicion and lead to a necessary outcome? But does that make it right? Privacy violations are generally considered wrong regardless of the outcome. However, the context of a cheating partner complicates things.\n\nMoral perspectives vary. Some might argue that the author had a right to know and that cheating is a betrayal that justifies their action. Others would say that trust should be at the core of the relationship, and if there's doubt, communication is better than snooping.\n\nAlso, the author's reflection on their own actions versus friends who snoop for no reason shows some self-awareness. They acknowledge the wrongness of snooping in general but justify it in this specific case.\n\nIn many ethical discussions, respecting someone's privacy is a key principle. Even if the outcome was good, the action of snooping is ethically questionable. However, the situation is a gray area because of the betrayal involved.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether one prioritizes the outcome (avoiding infidelity) over the means (privacy invasion). If the focus is on the action itself, then the author is in the wrong (A). If the focus is on the result and the context of infidelity, then maybe not (B). But generally, the act of snooping without consent is considered wrong, so the answer might lean towards A.\n"
