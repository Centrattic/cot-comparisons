A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned being in a depressive hole. The author had a gut feeling something was wrong, so they checked his phone while he was asleep and found he was cheating. They left a note and left, then he called and yelled at them for invading his privacy. The author argues that they didn't want to live in ignorance and saved themselves heartbreak.\n\nNow, the question is whether snooping was wrong. On one hand, snooping is a breach of privacy. Trust is important in a relationship, and sneaking around can damage that trust. The boyfriend felt betrayed because of the snooping, even though he was cheating. But on the other hand, the author had a reason\u2014they suspected something was seriously off and it turned out to be true. They might feel justified because they uncovered infidelity, which is a big deal.\n\nBut even if there's a valid reason, does that make snooping okay? Privacy is a two-way street. Cheating is wrong, but invading someone's privacy isn't right either. The author could have confronted him directly or sought advice instead of snooping. Their friends snooping for no reason is different, but in this case, they had a reason. However, the method of finding out might have caused additional hurt. The boyfriend's reaction shows that the breach of privacy hurt him, even though he was at fault.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. They had a reason, but the act itself is still a violation of privacy. Trust issues can lead to such actions, but it's not excusing the behavior. The author might not think they're wrong because they got the truth out, but ethically, snooping without consent is still wrong regardless of the outcome. So the answer might be A (Yes, they're in the wrong) because the act itself is a breach of privacy, even if the motive was to uncover something bad.\n"
