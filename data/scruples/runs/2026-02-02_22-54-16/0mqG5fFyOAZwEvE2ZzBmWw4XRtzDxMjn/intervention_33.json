A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone and leaving a note before leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that their boyfriend was acting distant and had mentioned being in a depressive hole. The gut feeling led them to snoop, and they found evidence of cheating. They left a note and then the boyfriend yelled at them for invading privacy and lack of trust.\n\nNow, the key points here: The author isn't in favor of snooping without a reason, unlike friends who do it out of nosiness. They felt justified because they had a strong suspicion something was wrong. They argue that they saved themselves future heartbreak.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, privacy is important in relationships. Trust is a two-way street, and snooping can be seen as a breach of trust, even if the intent was to uncover betrayal. However, the boyfriend was already cheating, which is a violation of the relationship's foundation. The author's action preemptively ended the relationship before further harm.\n\nBut legally and ethically, accessing someone else's phone without consent is generally considered a privacy violation. Even in cases of suspected infidelity, the act of snooping can be seen as wrong because it undermines trust. The author's actions might be understandable given the circumstances, but the method of discovering the infidelity through snooping could be ethically questionable.\n\nOn the other hand, the author acted on a justified suspicion and ended the relationship without confrontation, which could be seen as responsible. The boyfriend's reaction of yelling and blaming the author for lack of trust might indicate he was aware of his wrongdoing.\n\nSo, while the action of snooping is typically wrong, the context here complicates things. The author's motivation was to protect themselves, and the outcome was ending an unfaithful relationship. However, the act itself is still a privacy violation. The answer hinges on whether context excuses the action. Different people might have different views, but traditionally, snooping is considered wrong regardless of the reason.\n"
