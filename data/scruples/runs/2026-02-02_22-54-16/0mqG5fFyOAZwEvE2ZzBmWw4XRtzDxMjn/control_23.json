A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant, the author suspected something, and found out he was cheating. They left a note and left, then he yelled at them for invading privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of snooping. Generally, privacy is important in relationships. Even if there's suspicion, invading someone's privacy without their consent is a violation. The author mentions they did it because they had a gut feeling something was wrong, not just out of nosiness, which they differentiate from their friends. But the key issue is consent. Trust is a big part of relationships, and snooping can break that trust. The boyfriend felt betrayed because of the privacy invasion, even though he was cheating. \n\nOn the other hand, the author argues that they saved themselves future heartbreak by confronting the issue early. The cheating was the real issue here. But regardless of the outcome, the act of snooping without permission is a breach of trust. Relationships require mutual respect for boundaries. Even if the partner was cheating, the method of finding out (snooping) is still problematic. \n\nThere's also the aspect of how they handled it. Leaving a note and not confronting him directly might have been a way to avoid immediate conflict, but it still leaves the situation unresolved. The boyfriend's reaction was to yell and call them a piece of shit, which is hurtful, but his response is also a reaction to the violation of privacy. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is in the wrong for snooping. While the cheating was the root problem, the means of discovering it involved a breach of trust. The focus should be on communication and addressing the issues rather than covert surveillance. Even with good intentions, the action itself is ethically questionable. So the answer would be A.\n"
