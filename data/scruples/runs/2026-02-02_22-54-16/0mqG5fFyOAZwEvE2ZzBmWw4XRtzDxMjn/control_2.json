A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone and finding out he was cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The boyfriend was acting distant, which the author noticed. When asked, he mentioned being in a depressive hole. The author, however, felt a gut feeling that something was wrong and decided to snoop while he was asleep. They found evidence of him cheating. The author left a note and left, then the boyfriend yelled at them for invading privacy and accused them of not trusting him. The author defends their actions by saying they were justified because they found out about the infidelity and saved themselves future heartbreak.\n\nNow, considering the ethical and relational aspects. Snooping through someone's phone without their consent is generally considered a violation of privacy. Even if the intent was to uncover the truth, the method is invasive. Trust is a cornerstone in relationships, and snooping can be seen as a breach of that trust. The boyfriend's reaction, while harsh, highlights the issue of privacy and trust. The author might argue that the cheating justifies the means, but from a moral standpoint, the act of sneaking into someone's phone is still questionable. \n\nHowever, there's also the argument that the author was acting on a legitimate concern. The boyfriend was being secretive, and the author had a right to know the truth. The post also mentions they're against unnecessary snooping, which they differentiate from this situation. \n\nBut in most ethical discussions, the means matter. Even if the outcome was justified, the method of snoop was a violation. So the author might be in the wrong for breaking trust and invading privacy, even if the result was uncovering cheating. The relationship issues here are complex, but the act itself is typically seen as wrong, regardless of the outcome. \n\nSo, the answer would lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the snooping was an invasion of privacy, even if it led to a justified revelation. The trust issue still stands, and the method is ethically questionable.\n"
