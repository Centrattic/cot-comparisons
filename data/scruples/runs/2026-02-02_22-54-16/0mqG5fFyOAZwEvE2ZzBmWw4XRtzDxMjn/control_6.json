A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant, the author suspected something, and found out he was cheating. The author left a note and left, then the boyfriend was upset about the privacy invasion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Snooping into someone's phone without their consent is generally seen as a violation of privacy. Even if the author had a reason, the act itself is still breach of trust. But then again, the boyfriend was cheating, which is also a betrayal. The author's actions might be justified in their eyes because it prevented further heartbreak. \n\nThe author mentions they're not pro-snooping unless there's a strong reason, which they felt they had. They contrast themselves with friends who snoop out of nosiness. So the author believes their actions were justified. But does that make them right?\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. By snooping, the author might have acted out of concern, but it still undermines trust. The boyfriend's reaction is also valid\u2014he felt his privacy was invaded. However, cheating is a major issue. The author's action led to uncovering the truth, which might be seen as necessary. \n\nBut legally and ethically, privacy laws usually protect individuals from others accessing their devices without consent. Even in the context of a relationship, this can be a gray area. Some might argue that the ends justify the means here, while others would say the means were wrong regardless of the outcome.\n\nAlso, the aftermath: the author left a note and didn't confront him immediately, which might have been a thoughtful approach to avoid immediate conflict. However, the boyfriend's anger is about the violation of privacy, not just the cheating. It's a balance between the right to privacy and the need for honesty in a relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, there are valid points on both sides. The author's intention was to uncover the truth to protect themselves from further harm, which is understandable. However, the method of doing so involved a breach of trust and privacy. So whether the author is in the wrong depends on the perspective\u2014whether the privacy violation outweighs the cheating revelation. Since the question is about being in the wrong, and considering societal norms usually favor respecting privacy even in relationships, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong). But there's a strong case for B as well. Hmm.\n"
