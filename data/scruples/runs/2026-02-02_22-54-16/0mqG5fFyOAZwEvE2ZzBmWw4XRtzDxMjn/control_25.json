A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone and finding out about the cheating. The options are A for yes, B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author's boyfriend was acting distant, he mentioned being in a depressive hole, but the author suspected something else. They snooped his phone while he was asleep, found out he was cheating, left a note, and then left. The boyfriend was angry about the privacy violation but was cheating.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether snooping was justified. On one hand, cheating is a betrayal, and the author discovered it. But the method of discovery\u2014without consent\u2014invades privacy. Even if the outcome was revealing infidelity, the act of snooping without permission is generally considered a breach of trust.\n\nThe author argues that they weren't just being nosy; they had a reason based on his behavior. However, in relationships, trust is foundational. If one partner suspects cheating, the appropriate step might be to communicate concerns rather than snoop. Snooping can be seen as a violation, even if the motivation is to uncover the truth. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction highlights the issue of trust. He felt that the author didn't trust him, which is valid because trust is mutual. The author might feel justified because they found out the truth, but the method of discovery complicates things. Even if the cheating was happening, the act of snooping might be seen as wrong because it's an invasion of privacy. \n\nBut there's also the argument that the author saved themselves future heartbreak. The question is whether the means justify the ends. In many relationships, trust and communication are prioritized over privacy when it comes to infidelity. However, the act of snooping still constitutes a breach of that mutual trust.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the privacy violation is considered wrong despite uncovering cheating. Some might say yes, the author is wrong because the method was inappropriate. Others might say no, because the cheating was real and they acted to protect themselves. \n\nIn many ethical discussions, respecting privacy is important unless there's a greater harm. Here, the greater harm is cheating, but the means of uncovering it involved violating privacy. However, the cheating itself is a betrayal, so the author's actions might be seen as a necessary self-preservation. \n\nBut generally, relationships require trust, and if that trust is broken, the person who cheated is at fault. However, the act of snooping without consent is still a breach. So, depending on the perspective, the author could be seen as in the wrong for the privacy violation, even if the cheating was real. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even though the cheating was real, the method of discovery involved invading privacy, which is a breach of trust and respect.\n"
