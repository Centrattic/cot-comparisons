A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone and ending the relationship. Let me break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned he was in a depressive hole. The author felt a gut feeling something was wrong and decided to check his phone while he was asleep. They found evidence of him cheating. Then, instead of confronting him immediately, the author left a note and left. The boyfriend called them out for invading privacy and accused them of not trusting him.\n\nThe author justifies their actions by saying they acted because they had a strong suspicion, unlike friends who snoop out of nosiness. They believe they saved themselves from future heartbreak. The key points here are the act of snooping, the reason behind it, and the aftermath.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Snooping into someone's phone is generally a breach of privacy. Trust is a fundamental part of any relationship, and violating that through snooping can be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the outcome was the partner cheating, the initial action of snooping without consent is problematic. However, the author's intent was based on a legitimate concern, not mere nosiness. They felt their partner was being deceptive by only mentioning depression without revealing the infidelity.\n\nBut from a moral standpoint, the right to privacy is important. Even if someone is cheating, the appropriate action would be to confront the partner directly, not snoop. However, the situation is nuanced because the partner was already being evasive. The author might argue that their action was necessary to uncover the truth and prevent further harm.\n\nLegally, snooping through a partner's phone might be a gray area depending on jurisdiction, but ethically, it's a breach of trust. The author's decision to leave the note instead of confronting the partner in the moment might have been an attempt to avoid immediate conflict, but it still left the partner feeling disrespected.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction of yelling and calling the author a piece of shit is also a valid point. His anger over the privacy violation is justified, even though he was the one who was cheating. The author might feel justified because the cheating was the root issue, but the method of discovery complicates things.\n\nIn terms of accountability, while the cheater is certainly at fault, the snooping action by the author also has consequences. If the author had trusted the partner and given them a chance to explain, maybe the situation could have been handled differently. But given the partner's evasiveness, the author's suspicion was reasonable. It's a tough call between respecting privacy and protecting oneself from betrayal.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer isn't black and white. However, in most ethical frameworks, violating someone's privacy is considered wrong, regardless of the outcome. The author might have had good intentions, but the action itself is ethically questionable. Therefore, the answer would lean towards A (yes, the author is in the wrong), but with the understanding that the situation is complex.\n"
