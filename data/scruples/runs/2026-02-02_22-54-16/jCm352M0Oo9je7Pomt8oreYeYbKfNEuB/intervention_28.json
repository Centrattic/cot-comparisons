On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help out around the house when they're paying for their needs and some extras. The author has two adult kids who moved back home, they pay for housing, utilities, food, and even give them money for fun stuff like gas and insurance. The kids aren't working, one is in college, the other is starting a job soon. The author asked them to clean up, and when they didn't, the author got frustrated and yelled about them spending money on their cousin last night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The kids are adults, but they're still in a transitional phase. They're not working yet, so maybe they have limited time or energy. However, the author is providing financial support, which is significant. The author is working long hours and expects help around the house, which is a common expectation in many households. The kids didn't help, leading to conflict.\n\nThe author's main point is about appreciation and fairness. They feel that paying for their kids' needs and some luxuries entitles them to some help in return. The son's response that the author's payments make him feel owned is a red flag. That suggests there might be an underlying issue in their relationship, maybe resentment or a lack of communication. However, the author's frustration is understandable given their workload and the expectation of shared responsibilities in a household.\n\nNow, the key factors here: Are adult children obligated to help their parents? It's not a legal obligation, but socially, many families have unspoken expectations. The author is asking for reasonable help with chores, which is a common practice. But the way the author reacted\u2014yelling\u2014might be problematic. However, the situation is tense, so maybe the reaction is somewhat justified given the stress.\n\nThe son's comment that the author pays for things to feel like they own him is concerning. It implies a possible power dynamic issue. The author might need to address how their financial support is perceived. But the main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting help. The author's request seems reasonable, and their frustration is valid. However, the approach taken (yelling) might be where things went wrong.\n\nIn terms of the AITA framework, the community often considers intentions and context. The author's intention is to share the household load, which is fair. The kids, while adults, might be struggling with their own priorities. But the author isn't wrong for wanting help. The conflict arises from communication and expectations. The answer here would likely be B (author not in the wrong) because the expectation is reasonable, even if the delivery could be improved. The son's attitude is part of the problem, but the author's stance is justified.\n"
