On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house since they pay for things. \n\nFirst, the situation: the author has two adult kids who moved back home. They pay for housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even some fun money. The kids aren't working yet (one is in college, the other starts soon). The parents work long hours. The kids are being asked to help with chores, but they haven't been very responsive. The mom got upset and yelled, especially after the son made a comment about feeling owned.\n\nSo, the author's main point is asking if it's their fault for expecting help in exchange for financial support. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know the assistant's take.\n\nI need to consider if it's reasonable to expect help. Adult children are adults, so they should contribute. But the parents are providing a lot financially. The son's comment about being owned is problematic. The mom's reaction might have been harsh, but she's stressed with long hours. \n\nIs it fair to expect chores when you're supporting someone financially? In many households, yes. But if the kids are busy with their own things (like settling into a new place), maybe there's room for more flexibility. However, the kids have been living there for a while\u20143 months for the son. He had a dresser for months but didn't set up his room? Maybe he's not prioritizing helping.\n\nThe mom is frustrated and yelled, which might be a misstep, but the expectation itself isn't unreasonable. The son's attitude is also an issue. So the author isn't in the wrong for expecting help. Answer B.\n"
