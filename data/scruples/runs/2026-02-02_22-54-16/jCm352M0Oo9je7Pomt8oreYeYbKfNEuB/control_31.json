He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the parent is asking their adult children, who are both in their early 20s and living at home, to help with chores. The parent is paying for their housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even some fun activities. The kids aren't working yet, one is going to college and the other starts a job soon. The parent feels they're contributing financially and expects some help around the house. The son, in particular, was asked to do dishes, and he responded by focusing on setting up his new dresser instead. The parent got angry, brought up the money spent on the cousin's outing, and the son claims the parent is trying to \"own\" him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The kids are adults, so they have some responsibility. The parent is covering a lot of expenses, which is a significant financial and time commitment. The parent is working long hours, so maybe they have limited time and energy left. The children aren't working yet, but one is in college and the other is about to start a job. They might be busy with their own schedules. However, helping around the house is a basic expectation in many households, even if it's not a clean freak situation. The parent is asking for appreciation through helping out, which seems reasonable. The son's response about the parent trying to \"own\" him is a bit extreme and dismissive. \n\nBut wait, the parent is providing financial support, so expecting some reciprocal help isn't unreasonable. However, the parent might be overstepping if they're using money as a lever to control the kids' behavior. The argument is that the parent is using guilt-tripping by mentioning the cousin's outing. The son's reaction suggests he feels manipulated, which could be valid if the parent is using financial contributions as a way to demand more labor. On the other hand, basic chores are part of living in a shared space. \n\nSo, is the parent wrong for expecting their adult children to pitch in, considering they're contributing financially? Or is the parent justified in asking for help since they're shouldering most responsibilities? The key here is whether the expectation is reasonable. In many cases, when people live together, even adults, it's fair to expect shared responsibilities. However, the parent might be mixing up financial support with emotional or domestic expectations. The son's comment about feeling \"owned\" indicates a possible boundary issue. \n\nBut the parent isn't asking for a lot\u2014just basic help like dishes, which is a common chore. The parent also mentions the house is \"very lived in,\" so maybe the standards aren't high. The problem might be more about communication and the parent's approach when they got angry and brought up the cousin's outing. That could be seen as guilt-tripping, which might not be the best approach. \n\nIn summary, the parent's expectation isn't unreasonable, but the way they enforced it and the son's reaction suggest a breakdown in communication. The parent isn't necessarily in the wrong for expecting help, but their method of expressing it might have been harsh. The son's response is also problematic. So, the answer would be B (the parent isn't in the wrong), but there's room for both sides to improve communication. However, according to the question, the options are A or B. Since the parent's demand for help is reasonable given the living arrangement, the answer is B.\n"
