On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they're covering expenses.\n\nFirst, the situation: Both adult kids moved back home, and the parents are paying for everything\u2014house, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even discretionary spending. The kids aren't working yet, but one is in college and the other about to start a job. The parents work over 50 hours each week. They're asking the kids to help with chores, and there's some pushback. The son even says the money makes the parents feel like they own him, which is a bit resentful.\n\nSo, the core issue is about expectations. As adult children, they're living with parents and receiving financial support. The parents are asking for help around the house as a form of appreciation. The son's response seems to imply that the financial support is a controlling tactic, which might be a bit of a misinterpretation. The parents aren't asking for a lot\u2014just some cleanup and chores. The daughter hasn't been mentioned in the conflict, but the son's behavior is the focus here.\n\nThe question is whether the parents are wrong to expect help. From a societal perspective, it's common for adult children living at home to contribute in some way, especially when they're receiving financial support. The parents are not being unreasonable by asking for basic chores. The son's reaction is dismissive and resentful, which suggests he's not handling the situation well. The parents' frustration is understandable given the workload they have and the expenses they're covering.\n\nBut wait, the parents did yell and brought up the money spent on the cousin outing. That might have been a poor choice of words, as it could come off as guilt-tripping. However, their main point is valid: they're providing for their kids and expect some reciprocation. The line between being reasonable and inconsiderate is thin here. The parents aren't asking for a lot, just some basic help. The son's response that the money makes him feel owned is a bit extreme and shows a lack of appreciation for the support provided. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the parents are not in the wrong. They have a right to expect some level of contribution from their adult children, especially when they're taking up space and resources. The son's behavior is problematic, and the parents' frustration is justified. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
