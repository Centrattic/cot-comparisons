He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help with household chores given that they pay for things.\n\nFirst, the situation: Both adult kids moved back home within the past year. The parents are paying for housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even giving money for fun. The kids aren't working yet\u2014one is in college, the other starts a job soon. The parents work over 50 hours each week. The author is asking for help around the house, like doing dishes, but the son is reluctant, leading to an argument where the author yells about the money spent on their cousin's outing.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations of appreciation and helping out versus the reality of the kids' current situations. The parents are providing significant financial support, which is a lot. They\u2019re working long hours and expecting some help around the house. The kids, on the other hand, are in transitional phases\u2014college and starting a new job\u2014which might mean they're adjusting and dealing with their own stressors.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. They\u2019re contributing a lot and feel it's only fair to ask for help. But the son's response that the money makes the author feel like they \"own him\" is a red flag. This suggests that the dynamic might be more complex, perhaps with underlying issues of control or resentment. The author's reaction of yelling might not be the best approach, but it's a response to frustration.\n\nLegally or morally, is the author in the wrong? They\u2019re not obligated to provide for their adult children, but once they do, they can certainly expect some level of responsibility. However, the way the author expressed their expectations\u2014yelling and making a public accusation about the son's attitude\u2014might have been harsh. The kids are adults, and the approach should be respectful, even if the expectation is reasonable.\n\nThe answer here hinges on balancing the right to expect help in a shared household with the method used to enforce that expectation. The author isn't wrong for expecting help, but the manner in which they addressed it could be improved. So the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong for the expectation, but could handle the situation better.\n"
