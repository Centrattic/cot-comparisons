On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they're paying for everything. The kids moved back home, and the parents work long hours. The author got upset when the son didn't do the dishes even after being asked.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The kids are adults, 21 and 20. One is in college, the other is starting a job soon. They're not working, but they're getting money for fun, gas, insurance, etc. The parents are covering housing, utilities, food. The son said that because the parents pay for things, it makes him feel like they own him. That's a red flag. The author got angry and mentioned that the kids took their cousin out last night, implying they should show appreciation by helping.\n\nSo, the key points are: the parents are providing for their adult children, but the kids aren't contributing household chores. The parents are working a lot, and the kids aren't working yet. The son's response about feeling owned is problematic. The author is upset because they're paying for everything and expect some help in return. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a gray area. On one hand, parents can set expectations for their adult children living at home, especially when contributing to household chores. On the other hand, the parents are providing financial support, which might be seen as a trade-off. However, the son's response that the parents' support makes him feel owned is a toxic dynamic. The author is not wrong in expecting some form of appreciation or help, especially since they're working hard and the kids aren't contributing financially. The author's frustration seems reasonable. The answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no cultural context or other factors I'm missing. In many cultures, adult children helping out is expected, and parents have the right to set boundaries. The son's attitude is problematic, so the author isn't in the wrong for wanting help. So, answer B.\n"
