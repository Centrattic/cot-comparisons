He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for expecting their adult children to help with chores since they pay for their living expenses. The kids are 21 and 20, both moved back home, and neither has a job yet. The parents work over 50 hours a week, and the kids have started college, with one starting a job soon.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents are providing a lot\u2014housing, utilities, food, and even money for fun stuff and gas/insurance. The author is asking for basic help around the house, like doing dishes, which the kids only did a little of. The son's response about needing to organize his room after being there three months seems a bit dismissive. The author got upset and mentioned their spending on the cousin, leading the son to accuse her of feeling ownership.\n\nSo, the key points are: parental financial support vs. expected help. The author isn't a clean freak, just wants the house not to be a mess. The kids are adults, so there's an expectation they contribute. The son's reaction might be defensiveness or ingratitude. The author's frustration is understandable given their workload and expenses. \n\nBut is the author wrong? In many cases, when adults live at home, contributing to household chores is a reasonable expectation, especially if the parents are covering most costs. The author isn't asking for a lot, just some help to make life easier. The son's comment about ownership is a red flag, suggesting a possible power dynamic issue. However, the author's reaction\u2014yelling after the son dismissed her request\u2014might be seen as overreacting, but given the context, maybe justified.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's stance seems reasonable. They're not unreasonable in expecting help from adults who benefit from their financial support. The kids' lack of effort and the son's defensiveness likely contribute to the conflict. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
