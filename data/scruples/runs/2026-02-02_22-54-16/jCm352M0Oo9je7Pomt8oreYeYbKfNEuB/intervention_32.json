On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help with housework since they pay for things. The situation is that both kids moved back home, the parents are working a lot, and they're giving money for fun, gas, insurance, etc. The kids aren't working (one is in college, the other starting a job soon). The parent got angry when the son didn't help with dishes after they had spent money on their cousin.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. The parent is providing financial support, which is significant. The kids are adults, so there's an expectation that they should contribute to household chores. But maybe the parent's approach is causing tension? The son's response about the parent feeling like they own him is a red flag. The parent might be mixing up financial support with needing gratitude, which can be a tricky dynamic. \n\nOn the other hand, it's reasonable for parents to expect some basic help around the house when they're covering so much. The parent mentions they aren't a clean freak, so the expectation isn't excessive. The son had been living out of a suitcase for months, so maybe he's been less proactive. \n\nThe parent's frustration is understandable, but yelling might not be the best approach. However, the core issue is whether the expectation itself is wrong. Since the kids are adults and the parents are covering a lot, expecting some help is reasonable. The problem might be how the parent is communicating it rather than the expectation itself. So the answer is B, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
