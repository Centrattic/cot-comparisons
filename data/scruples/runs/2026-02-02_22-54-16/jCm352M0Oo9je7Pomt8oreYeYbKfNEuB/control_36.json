On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they pay for things. The kids are 21 and 20, back home, not working yet, and the parents work a lot. The author mentions giving money for fun, gas, insurance, etc. The son and daughter moved back in, and the author is frustrated when they don't help with chores.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. In many societies, it's common for parents to expect some level of contribution from their adult children in exchange for financial support. Since the kids are adults, even if they're still in school or starting a job, there's an expectation of shared responsibilities. The author isn't a clean freak, just wants some help. \n\nThe son's response about the author \"owning\" him is a red flag. That suggests resentment and possible manipulation. The author is trying to get gratitude and help, which is reasonable. The parents are working 50+ hours each, so they're probably stretched thin. \n\nBut some might argue that the kids are still in transition\u2014maybe the daughter starts a job soon, and the son is in college. However, both aren't working yet. The author's frustration is valid because they're covering multiple expenses. Expecting some household help isn't unreasonable. \n\nAlso, the author's reaction of getting angry and yelling might be seen as harsh, but the underlying request isn't wrong. The kids' attitude is problematic. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They have a right to ask for help, especially since they're providing significant support. The answer should be B (No).\n"
