On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they pay for everything.\n\nFirst, the author has two adult kids who moved back home. They're providing housing, utilities, food, and even money for fun, gas, and insurance. The kids aren't working yet\u2014though one is going to college and the other is starting a job soon. The parents work over 50 hours each week. The author asked the kids to help with chores, and when they didn't do much, the author got angry and yelled about showing appreciation, especially after paying for their cousin's outing.\n\nThe son responded by saying the author pays to feel like they own him. The author is questioning if they're in the wrong for asking for help in exchange for the financial support.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. Are the parents entitled to expect help? The kids are adults, so they might be expected to contribute to the household. However, the parents are providing a lot financially. But maybe the kids are in a transition phase\u2014college and starting a job. The author's frustration is understandable given their workload. But yelling and implying guilt over the cousin's outing might not be the best approach. Also, the son's resentment about feeling owned adds complexity. \n\nThe key points: The parents are providing significant support, and the kids are adults who might be expected to help, but the parents might be overstepping by linking financial support to chores in a way that feels controlling. The author's reaction might be seen as unfair if the kids are already under stress or transitioning. However, expecting some level of contribution is reasonable. So, maybe the answer isn't clear-cut. But the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because it's reasonable to expect help, but their method could be improved. The answer is B (No).\n"
