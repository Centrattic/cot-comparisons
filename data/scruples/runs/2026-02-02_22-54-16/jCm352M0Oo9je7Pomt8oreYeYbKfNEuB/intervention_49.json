On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they pay for them. The main points are that the parents provide housing, utilities, food, and other expenses, and the kids aren't contributing much except one is in college and the other is about to start a job. The parents work long hours, and the kids aren't helping with chores. The son even made a comment about the parent's money making him feel owned.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. It's common for parents to expect some level of contribution from kids, especially when they're living at home and the parents are covering significant expenses. The kids are adults, so expecting them to pitch in with chores isn't unreasonable. The parents aren't demanding perfection, just some basic help. \n\nThe parent's frustration is understandable. They're working hard, providing for the kids, and when they ask for help, they're met with resistance or excuses. The son's comment about being owned by his parents is a red flag here. It suggests a possible toxic dynamic where the child feels pressured or manipulated by financial support. However, the parent's request for appreciation through chores is a reasonable expectation. \n\nOn the flip side, the kids are in transition\u2014college and starting a job\u2014so maybe their priorities are different. But even then, basic household responsibilities shouldn't be a problem. The parent isn't unreasonable; they just want some help because they're working a lot. \n\nI think the key here is that the parent is not asking for anything excessive. They're not demanding the kids pay rent or take on huge responsibilities. They just want them to help with chores as part of living in the house. The son's reaction seems to be more about resentment towards the financial support rather than the chores themselves. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asking for a fair exchange of help in return for the support they're providing. The issue might be more about how the son perceives the financial support, but the parent's request is justified. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
