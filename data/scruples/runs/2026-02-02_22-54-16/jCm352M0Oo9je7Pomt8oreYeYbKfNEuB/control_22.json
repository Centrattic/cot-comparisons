On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house since they pay for things. The situation is that the two adult kids moved back home, the parents are working a lot, and they provide housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun stuff. The kids don't have jobs yet, but one is in college and the other is starting soon. The parents have asked them to help clean up, and the son didn't do the dishes, leading to an argument where the mom got angry and mentioned the money spent on their cousin's outing. The son's response is that since the parents pay, he feels they own him.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is wrong here. The key points are the expectations of adult children living at home. Typically, when young adults live with their parents, it's common to expect them to contribute to household chores. The parents are providing a lot, so expecting some help in return seems reasonable. However, the son's reaction suggests he might feel entitled or that the money is a payment for his stay, but that's not typical in family dynamics. The author's frustration is understandable given their financial and time contributions. They're not unreasonable in asking for help, especially since the house is \"lived in\" and not a clean freak scenario. The son's behavior of not doing the dishes and the defensive attitude might be the real issue here. The author's reaction, while perhaps a bit harsh (yelling), stems from feeling unappreciated. So, the author isn't in the wrong for expecting help. The answer should be B.\n"
