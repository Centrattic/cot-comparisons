On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they're paying for everything. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: Both adult kids moved back home, the parents pay for housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even give money for fun. The kids aren't working (though one is starting soon, the other is in college). The parents work long hours. The author asks them to help with chores but they only do a little. The son didn't do dishes despite being asked, leading to the parent yelling about them using money yesterday to take the cousin out.\n\nSo, the key points here. The parents are providing financial support, and in return, they expect some help with chores. The kids, however, aren't contributing as much as the parents would like. The son's response implies that the money given is making the parent feel like they own him, which is a bit of a defense mechanism. The parent got upset and yelled, which might be seen as overreacting, but the underlying request for help isn't unreasonable.\n\nNow, considering societal norms, when adult children move back in, it's common for parents to expect some level of contribution, especially around the house. However, this can vary depending on the family dynamic and what was agreed upon before moving back. The parents here are working long hours and providing significant financial support, so their expectation for some household help is understandable. \n\nThe kids are still in a transitional phase (college, starting a job), so maybe their ability to contribute is limited, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't help at all. The author's frustration is valid because they're giving a lot and not getting the help they expect. The son's argument about the money making the parent feel like they own him seems a bit extreme and dismissive of the parent's perspective.\n\nThe parent's reaction\u2014yelling after a request\u2014might be seen as harsh, but the initial request for help isn't wrong. It's reasonable to ask for basic chores in exchange for the support provided. The key here is whether the parent is overstepping by linking financial support to chores. But in many cases, especially when the kids aren't contributing financially, expecting some household help is fair. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). The parents have a right to expect some help in exchange for the support they provide. The kids might need to adjust their behavior, but the parent's stance isn't unreasonable.\n"
