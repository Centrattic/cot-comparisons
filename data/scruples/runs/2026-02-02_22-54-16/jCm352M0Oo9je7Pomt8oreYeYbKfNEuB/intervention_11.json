On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they pay for various expenses. The situation is that both children moved back home, the parents are working over 50 hours each week, and they provide housing, utilities, food, and even money for fun things, gas, and insurance. The kids don't have jobs yet (one is in college, the other starts soon). The parent got upset when the son didn't do the dishes and mentioned the money they've spent, like taking the cousin out to eat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents are providing significant financial support, which is understandable, especially if the children are in a transitional phase. But the parent is also asking for help with chores. The son's response about feeling owned by the money is a red flag. It seems like there's some underlying resentment or misunderstanding from the son's side.\n\nI think the key point is about mutual respect and responsibility. Even though the parents are paying for things, adult children generally should contribute to household chores. The parent isn't a clean freak, just wants some help. The son's behavior of not doing the dishes despite the request might be the main issue here. The parent's frustration is valid because they're contributing a lot and expecting some reciprocal effort. However, the way the parent expressed it by yelling about the money might have been a bit harsh. They could have communicated the expectation more calmly, perhaps setting clear boundaries without making the children feel guilty.\n\nThe daughter's situation isn't detailed, but since the son is the one mentioned, maybe she's not contributing either. The parent's approach might be causing tension. It's possible that the children don't realize the extent of the financial burden or how their contributions can ease that. The parent might need to have a better conversation about shared responsibilities rather than linking chores to money spent, which can create a transactional mindset.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I don't think so. They have a right to expect help, especially when they're shouldering so much. The son's attitude is problematic, and the parent's response, while maybe a bit strong, comes from a place of needing support. The author might need to adjust their communication style but isn't entirely at fault. Therefore, the answer should be B, No.\n"
