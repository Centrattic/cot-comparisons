On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they pay for things.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The parents have two adult children who moved back home. The parents cover housing, utilities, food, and even extra stuff like gas, insurance, and money for fun. The kids aren't working yet\u2014son is in college, daughter starts a job soon. The parents work long hours. The author got upset when the son didn't help with dishes, yelling about the money they spent on them last night.\n\nThe key points here are: Are adult children expected to contribute to household chores if the parents are covering their expenses? The author feels they're being unappreciative. The son's response that the parents' payments make him feel owned is a point of contention.\n\nLegally and socially, parental obligations usually end when a child becomes an adult. So the parents aren't required to support them financially. However, in this case, they're choosing to do so, possibly expecting some help in return. The problem is whether it's reasonable to expect chores in exchange for financial support.\n\nAdult children have the right to live their lives, but if they're living in a shared home, contributing to chores is a social norm. The parents are working a lot, so expecting some help is understandable. The son's attitude might be part of the issue here. The author's reaction\u2014yelling and bringing up past expenses\u2014could be seen as harsh, but the underlying expectation of help isn't unreasonable.\n\nThe son's comment about feeling owned complicates things. If the parents are giving money in a way that feels controlling, that's a problem. But the author is asking about the chores, not the financial support. The main question is about fairness in exchange. Since the parents are taking on the burden of work and expenses, it's reasonable to expect some household contributions. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries and asking for help. The son's lack of appreciation and the author's reaction might both have issues, but the core expectation isn't wrong.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They're justified in expecting their adult children to help around the house when they're living under the same roof and receiving financial support. The problem might be how the conflict is handled, but the expectation itself is reasonable.\n"
