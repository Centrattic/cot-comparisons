On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house since they're paying for things. The kids moved back home, and the parents are working a lot. The parents give them money for fun stuff, gas, insurance, and they're not working yet, except one is starting soon. The author got upset when the son didn't do the dishes after they had spent money on their cousin's outing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The kids are adults, so there's an expectation of responsibility. The parents are providing financial support, but maybe the kids feel entitled or not responsible. The author is asking if they're at fault for expecting help in exchange. \n\nFrom one angle, it's reasonable to expect some reciprocity. Parents might feel they deserve help when they're supporting their kids, especially financially. But kids might see it as their parents' choice, not an exchange for labor. Also, the son's comment that the author pays to feel ownership is a red flag\u2014it suggests there might be tension or past issues affecting the current situation. \n\nThe author got angry and yelled, which might not be the best approach. Maybe they should have communicated expectations clearly from the start. However, the core issue is whether expecting help is unreasonable. Since the kids are adults and the house is a shared space, it's fair to ask for contributions. The problem might be in the approach rather than the expectation itself. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but their reaction could be improved. The answer is B (No).\n"
