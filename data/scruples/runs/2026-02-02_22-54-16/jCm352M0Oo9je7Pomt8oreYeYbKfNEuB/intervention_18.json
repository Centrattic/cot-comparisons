On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house since they pay for their expenses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The parents are working long hours, and both kids are back home. The parents cover housing, utilities, food, and even extra stuff. The kids aren't working, but one is in college and the other is about to start a job. The parents ask for help with chores, and the kids respond in a way that makes the parents feel unappreciated. The son even accuses the parents of trying to \"own\" him with money.\n\nNow, the parents yell because they feel their efforts aren't appreciated. The key points here are the expectations of adult children helping in return, the financial support provided, and the kids' reactions. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I should consider cultural norms here. In many cultures, it's expected that adult children contribute to household chores, especially if they live at home and benefit from the parents' financial support. The parents aren't being unreasonable in asking for help, especially since they're working hard themselves. The son's response about the parents \"owning him\" seems dismissive and possibly disrespectful, which might be the real issue here.\n\nBut is the parent overstepping? The parents are providing significant support, and it's reasonable to expect some reciprocation. The children are adults, so they should have a sense of responsibility. The parent isn't demanding perfection, just basic help. The fact that the kids are getting financial help and still not helping could justify the parent's frustration. \n\nHowever, the parent did yell, which might be a point against them. But given the context, the parent's reaction is understandable. The author isn't in the wrong for expecting help in exchange for support. The kids need to take more responsibility. So the answer is B.\n"
