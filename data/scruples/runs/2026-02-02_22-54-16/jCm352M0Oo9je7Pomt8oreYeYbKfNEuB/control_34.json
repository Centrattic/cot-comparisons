      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help with chores since they cover various expenses. Let's break down the details.\n\nThe kids are 21 and 20, both moved back home. The parents pay for housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun things. The parents work over 50 hours each. The kids aren't working; one is in college, the other about to start. The parents have asked them to help with cleaning, and while they did a couple of things, there's been some conflict. The son didn't do the dishes when asked, and the mother got angry, mentioning the money they spent on their cousin. The son's response is that the mother pays for things to feel like owning him.\n\nFirst, the parents are providing significant financial support. It's common for adult children to help with chores, but the line can be blurry. The parents are working a lot, so expecting some help is reasonable. However, the son's reaction suggests he feels his mother's actions are controlling. The way the mother yelled could be seen as harsh, especially linking chores to past expenses. The father's comment about the mother feeling ownership is a red flag\u2014it might indicate underlying tension beyond just chores.\n\nThe daughter's situation is similar. Neither has a job, which adds to the parents' burden. The parents might feel they're doing a lot and deserve some help. However, the approach taken\u2014yelling and bringing up past expenses\u2014might not be the best way to ask for assistance. The core issue is whether expecting help is fair. Culturally, many people expect adult children to contribute to household chores when living at home, especially when the parents are working so much. But the method of communication here could be problematic.\n\nSo, the author's position isn't entirely wrong in expecting help, but their method might be. The son's response about feeling controlled suggests that the dynamic has issues beyond just chores. The parents might need to communicate differently, perhaps setting clear expectations without making it about control. The key is whether the request for help is reasonable (yes) and whether the way they expressed it crossed a line (maybe). However, the question is if the author is in the wrong for the expectation itself. Given that they're covering costs and working a lot, the expectation is valid. The answer leans towards B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that their approach needs adjustment.\n"
