On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house in exchange for the financial support they provide. \n\nFirst, the situation: Both adult children moved back in, neither has a job right now (one is in college, the other starting soon). The parents work over 50 hours each and cover all the living expenses, including utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun. The author is asking the kids to help with chores, which they partially do. When the son ignores a request to do dishes, the author gets angry and mentions the money spent on them showing appreciation, and there's some tension about the son feeling the money makes the parents feel they \"own\" him.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the parents are providing significant financial support. It's reasonable to expect some level of contribution in return, especially in a shared living space. However, the tone of the author's response\u2014yelling and bringing up past expenses\u2014might be seen as harsh or manipulative. The son's comment about feeling \"owned\" suggests that the approach might be making him resentful instead of appreciative.\n\nBut the core issue is whether expecting chores in exchange for support is fair. In many households, contributing to chores is part of living in a home, regardless of age. The parents aren't asking for a lot, just cleanup help. The children being in a transitional phase (college, starting a job) might affect their ability to contribute equally, but it's still reasonable to expect some effort. The author's frustration is understandable given the workload and financial burden.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have handled the situation better. Instead of yelling, a calm discussion about expectations could have been more effective. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not the method. The author's stance is that they pay for things, so help is expected. That's a common expectation in many families. The son's resistance might stem from a different perspective, but the author's position isn't inherently wrong. So, answer B.\n"
