On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house since they cover expenses like rent, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun. The kids are 21 and 20, both moved back home, one is in college, the other starting a job soon. The parents work over 50 hours each week.\n\nThe author got upset when the son didn't do the dishes, especially after they spent money on taking their cousin out. The son's response was about setting up his new dresser and mentioned that the author's payment makes him feel owned.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The kids are adults, so the expectation for contributing to household chores is reasonable. The parents are providing significant financial support, which is common when young adults move back in, especially for education or job transitions. However, the son's comment about feeling owned is a red flag. It suggests resentment and possible boundary issues.\n\nThe author might be in the right because it's fair to ask for help when you're supporting them. But there's the aspect of communication. Yelling and expressing anger might be seen as overreacting, especially if the request was clear. The son's reluctance could stem from feeling that the help is a trade-off for money, which the author might not have intended but the son interprets that way.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't unreasonable. They're not asking for a clean freak standard but just basic help. The key points are: the children are adults, the parents are working long hours, and there's a mutual expectation of support. However, the author's reaction could have been more measured. Yelling might be seen as harsh, even if the request was justified.\n\nThe son's comment about the cousin's outing is a bit of a deflection. It's possible the author feels they're being taken advantage of, but reacting with anger and bringing up past expenses might not be the best approach. Maybe a more constructive conversation about expectations and boundaries would be better.\n\nIn summary, while the author has a valid point in expecting help, the way the conflict was handled could be improved. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but there's room for the author to reflect on communication style.\n"
