On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they pay for things. The situation involves the kids moving back home, not having jobs, and the parents working long hours. The kids are getting money for fun things, gas, insurance, and the parents are asking for help with chores. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The kids are adults, so the parents might reasonably expect some contribution to household chores. The parents are providing financial support and housing, which is a lot. The kids are in a transitional phase\u2014one in college, the other starting soon. Maybe they're not used to working or helping out yet.\n\nThe key points are: Are the parents wrong to ask for help? The son's response about the parents \"owning him\" seems like a deflection. The parent got angry and mentioned the money spent on the cousin outing. Is it fair to link helping with chores to showing appreciation for the money spent?\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, expecting gratitude and contribution is understandable. However, using the money as leverage might not be the best approach. The parent is asking for practical help, which is normal in a household. The children's resistance could stem from feeling entitled, but they are adults, so the parent isn't necessarily wrong to set boundaries. The parent is providing for them, so it's reasonable to expect some reciprocation. The author's anger might be justified if they feel taken for granted.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The kids are under pressure (school, not working yet), and maybe the parents should be more patient. But they are adults, so some level of responsibility is expected. The parent's approach might be harsh, but the expectation itself isn't unreasonable. So the answer likely leans towards B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
