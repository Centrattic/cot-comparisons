On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house since they pay for things. \n\nFirst, the parent is paying for a house, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even giving money for fun things. Both kids moved back in the last year. The son is in college, the daughter starting a job soon. The parents work over 50 hours each week. They asked the kids to help clean, which they did a bit. The parent isn't a clean freak, the house is \"very lived in.\"\n\nThe son was asked to do the dishes, but he wanted to organize his new dresser. The parent got angry, yelling about the kids taking the cousin out and not showing appreciation. The son feels the parent's payments make him feel owned.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether expecting help in exchange for financial support is unreasonable. The parent is stressed, working long hours, and wants some help. The kids are adults, but they might not have been taught responsibility yet. The son's comment about feeling owned suggests resentment, which complicates things.\n\nIn some cultures, it's expected that adult children contribute when living at home, especially if parents are paying for them. However, the parent is also providing a lot, which might create an imbalance. The parent's anger seems justified if they feel taken for granted, but the kids might not have realized the extent of the parent's contributions. The parent's outburst might be harsh, but the underlying request isn't unreasonable. \n\nConsidering all that, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to expect some help, especially given their financial support. However, their approach (yelling) was poor. But the question is about being \"in the wrong\" regarding the request itself. So the answer is B.\n"
