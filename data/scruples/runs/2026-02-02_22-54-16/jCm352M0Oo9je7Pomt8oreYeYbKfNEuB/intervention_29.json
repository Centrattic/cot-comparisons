On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is at fault for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they're paying for their expenses, especially since the kids aren't working yet and one is in college.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are working over 50 hours each week and covering housing, utilities, food, and even some discretionary spending like gas, insurance, and fun activities. The kids are adults, but both moved back home recently. One is in college, and the other is starting a job soon. The parents are asking for help with chores, and when they bring up the financial support, the son reacts negatively, saying the parent is trying to \"own\" him.\n\nThe main issue is whether it's reasonable to expect adult children to contribute to household chores in exchange for financial support. The parents argue they're paying for everything, so some help is expected. The kids, however, don't seem to comply and react defensively.\n\nFrom a common-sense perspective, many people might agree that if you're living under someone's roof and being supported financially, contributing to household chores is fair. The parents aren't asking for a lot; just basic help like doing dishes. The kids' response, especially the son's comment about feeling owned, suggests there might be underlying issues, like resentment or a sense of obligation. But does that make the parents wrong for expecting help?\n\nI should also consider cultural and familial norms. In some families, helping out is expected as part of being a respectful adult. In others, there might be different expectations. The key here is that the parents are not being unreasonable in their requests. They\u2019re not asking for a lot, just some cooperation to maintain the household.\n\nHowever, the parents' approach might be part of the problem. Yelling and bringing up past expenses could be seen as guilt-tripping, which isn't effective. But the core expectation of help isn't inherently wrong. The son's reaction is problematic, but that doesn't mean the parent was wrong to express frustration.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parents aren't in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house. The issue is more about communication and mutual expectations. The answer should be B (No).\n"
