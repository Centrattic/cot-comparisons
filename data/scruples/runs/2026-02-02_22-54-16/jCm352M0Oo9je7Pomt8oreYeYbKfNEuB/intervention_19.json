On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is an adult who has adult children living at home. They pay for everything\u2014house, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun things. The kids aren't working yet; one is in college, the other about to start. The parents work over 50 hours each week. The author asked the kids to help around the house, and when they didn't do much, they got upset. The son even made a comment implying the author's payments make him feel owned.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents are providing financial support, which is significant. The kids are adults, so there's an expectation of contributing. But are they obligated? The kids are in transitional phases\u2014college and starting a job. Maybe they're not used to managing responsibilities yet. The author's frustration is understandable given the workload. However, the son's response about feeling owned is a red flag. It suggests a possible control issue or resentment. The author's reaction of yelling might be seen as harsh, but it's a response to feeling unappreciated.\n\nBut the core question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting help. In many cultures, adult children are expected to contribute to household chores even if they're supported financially. The author isn't a clean freak, just asking for basic help. The son's behavior of not doing the dishes when asked, especially after being given resources like a dresser, seems dismissive. The author's anger is a reaction to perceived ingratitude. However, the author's approach of yelling and making the son feel guilty might be counterproductive. The son's comment about ownership is troubling and might indicate underlying issues, but the author's initial request isn't unreasonable.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong for expecting help. It's a common expectation in family dynamics. The issue might be communication style and the son's defensive attitude. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
