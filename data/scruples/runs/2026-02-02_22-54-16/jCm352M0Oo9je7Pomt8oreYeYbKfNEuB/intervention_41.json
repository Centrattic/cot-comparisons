On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house. The author is providing financial support and has been giving them money for fun things, gas, and insurance. The kids moved back home, one is in college and the other is starting a job soon. The author works long hours and is asking for help with chores.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The kids are adults, so the expectation that they contribute to household duties is reasonable. Even though the author isn't a clean freak, basic cleanliness is part of shared living. The author is giving financial support, which might create a sense of obligation, but it's natural to ask for reciprocal help. The son's response about feeling owned because of the payments seems like a deflection. The author's frustration is understandable given their workload and financial contributions. The key point is whether expecting help in exchange for support is fair. Since the children are adults, it's reasonable to ask them to contribute to household responsibilities. The author's reaction, while perhaps a bit strong, is based on a valid expectation. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
