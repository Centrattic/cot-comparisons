On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the parent, who's working long hours, providing for their adult children who've moved back home. The kids aren't working (one is in college, the other starts soon), and the parent expects them to help with chores. The parent got upset when the son didn't do the dishes and made a comment about money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They\u2019re paying for the kids' needs and even extras, and they\u2019re working a lot. It's reasonable to expect some help around the house, especially since they\u2019re living under the same roof. The parent isn't a clean freak, just wants a lived-in home. They did ask nicely but the kids didn't comply. The son's response about the parent paying to \"own\" him seems like a deflection. That could be a red flag for entitlement or ingratitude.\n\nOn the other hand, the kids are adults, but they\u2019re still in a transitional phase. Maybe they\u2019re adjusting to moving back home, and the parent's expectations might not be clearly communicated. However, the parent did ask them to help, and the kids didn't follow through. The parent's reaction was frustration, which is normal when expectations aren't met. \n\nThe key points are: the parent is providing financial support, the kids aren't contributing equally, and the parent feels it's fair to ask for help. The son's comment about being \"owned\" is problematic and suggests a lack of appreciation. The parent\u2019s frustration is understandable. \n\nI think the parent isn't in the wrong here. They have a right to expect some level of responsibility from their adult children, especially when they're contributing financially. The kids might need to learn to take on household responsibilities as part of living with others. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
