On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they pay for things. The author has two adult kids who moved back home, neither has a job yet (one in college, the other starting soon). The parents work over 50 hours each week, and the kids aren't helping with chores. The author felt justified in asking them to contribute because they're providing financial support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider family dynamics. The kids are adults, so the expectation for contributing to household chores is reasonable. The author is providing a home, utilities, food, and other expenses, which is a significant financial burden. It's common for parents to expect some level of responsibility from adult children who are living under their roof, especially when they're not contributing financially yet.\n\nHowever, the author's reaction seems a bit harsh. They yelled at their son and brought up previous expenses as a way to make the kids feel guilty. The son's response about the author feeling like they own him is concerning. This suggests a possible power imbalance or manipulation through guilt. The author might be using the money they spend as leverage, which could be a way to control the kids, even if their intention is to encourage responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, the kids might be overwhelmed or adjusting to moving back home. They're adults but not yet in stable jobs, so maybe they're not used to balancing chores with other responsibilities. The author's frustration is understandable given their workload and financial contributions. It's a balancing act between being fair and maintaining a healthy relationship.\n\nThe key points are: Are the expectations reasonable? Yes, adult children should help around the house. But the method used\u2014yelling and guilt-tripping\u2014might be problematic. The author is not in the wrong for wanting help, but their approach could be improved. So the answer is B: No, the author is not in the wrong, but their method could be better handled.\n"
