On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they pay for things. The situation is that both kids moved back home, the parents are working a lot, and they're covering expenses. The kids aren't working except one is starting soon. The author had a heated moment when asking for help with dishes.\n\nFirst, the author is contributing significantly by covering housing, utilities, food, and other expenses. It's reasonable to expect some reciprocal help, especially in a household where parents are working long hours. The kids are adults, so setting expectations for shared responsibilities makes sense. \n\nHowever, the author's response was to yell and bring up the money spent, which might have been harsh. The son's comment about the author trying to own him suggests there's some tension or past issues. The author's frustration is valid, but the approach might have been poor. \n\nThe key points are: 1) The author is providing for the kids, so expecting help isn't unreasonable. 2) The reaction (yelling and bringing up the money) could be seen as overreacting, but the underlying request isn't wrong. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The expectation to help isn't wrong, but the way it was handled might have been. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for the request itself. Since the request is reasonable, the answer is B. The problem is more about the method of communication than the expectation itself.\n"
