On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for expecting their adult children to help with chores since they're paying for expenses. The kids moved back home, the parents are working a lot, and the kids aren't contributing much.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents are providing housing, utilities, food, plus extra expenses like gas, insurance, and leisure activities. They also mentioned paying for a cousin's outing. The children aren't working; one is in college, the other is about to start. The parent felt justified in asking for help, and the son's response about the parent trying to own him adds tension.\n\nThe key points are the expectations of parental support versus the children's responsibilities. In many cultures, adult children are expected to contribute to household chores, especially when the parents are shouldering significant costs. The parent isn't a clean freak, so the request isn't unreasonable. However, the parent's reaction included yelling, which might be seen as harsh. But the core issue is the expectation of contribution.\n\nThe son's comment about the parent's payment making him feel owned is a red flag. That suggests possible resentment or manipulation. The parent is just asking for appreciation through chores, which is a common social norm. The parent's frustration is understandable given the workload and the lack of help. The children's lack of jobs might mean they have time to help, even if they're in school. \n\nSo, balancing all factors: the parent's expectations are reasonable, the children's lack of contribution is unhelpful, and the parent's reaction, while maybe a bit over the top, stems from a place of needing assistance. The parent isn't in the wrong for expecting help in exchange for financial support. The author isn't at fault here.\n"
