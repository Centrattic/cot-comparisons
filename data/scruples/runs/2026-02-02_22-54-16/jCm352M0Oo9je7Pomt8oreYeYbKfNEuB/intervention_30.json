On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent who's providing for their adult children\u2014housing, utilities, food, even money for fun stuff and gas. The kids are back home, one in college, the other starting a job soon. The parent is working a lot and asking for help around the house. The son didn't help with dishes and made a comment about the parent paying for things so they feel like they own him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They're contributing a lot financially and are working long hours. It's reasonable to expect some help with chores, especially since they live there. The parent isn't a clean freak, just wants a lived-in house. The kids have been given resources, so asking for appreciation through helping out seems fair.\n\nOn the other hand, the kids are adults. They might feel that since the parent is paying, they don't have to do chores. But that's a bit of a privilege mindset. It's common for parents to expect some contribution when their adult kids live at home, even if they're not working yet. The son's response about the parent feeling ownership is a bit strong, but maybe he's defensive because he feels guilty or pressured.\n\nThe parent did yell and brought up past expenses, which might have been a harsh way to express their feelings. However, the core issue of expecting help in exchange for support isn't inherently wrong. The parent isn't demanding perfection, just some basic help. The kids' attitude is problematic here. So, the parent isn't in the wrong for asking for appreciation through chores. The answer should be B.\n"
