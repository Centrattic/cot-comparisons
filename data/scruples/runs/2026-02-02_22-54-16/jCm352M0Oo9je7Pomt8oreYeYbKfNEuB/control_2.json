On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they're paying for everything. The author has two adult kids who moved back home, and they're both not working yet (one in college, one starting soon). The parents work long hours. The author gave them money for fun stuff, gas, insurance, etc. They asked the kids to clean up, and the son didn't do the dishes, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is being unreasonable. The kids are adults, so maybe they should contribute. But the parents are already covering a lot financially. The son's comment about the author feeling like they own him is a red flag. Maybe the author's approach is too controlling? But the parents are providing for them, so expecting some help in return might be fair. However, the way the author expressed it\u2014yelling and bringing up the money spent\u2014could be seen as shaming, which might be inappropriate. \n\nAlso, the son has been living out of a suitcase for three months, so maybe he's dealing with moving in and adjusting. The author got a dresser for him, which is a nice gesture, but expecting immediate help might be too soon. The daughter and son took their cousin out, which the author paid for, and then used that as a reason to expect help. Is that fair? Maybe the author is conflating financial support with obligation to help. \n\nOn the other hand, it's reasonable for parents to expect some contribution from adult children living at home, especially when they're not working. The key here is whether the expectations are clear and if the author's reaction was justified. The yelling and the accusation that the son feels owned might be unproductive. The author might be in a stressful situation, balancing work and family, which adds context. But the core issue is about mutual respect and setting boundaries without being controlling. \n\nSo, the author isn't entirely wrong, but their approach could be improved. However, the question is if they're in the wrong. Given that they're providing for the kids and expecting some help is reasonable, but the way they handled it might be the problem. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the expectation is valid, but the method could be better. Alternatively, maybe A if the tone is too harsh. But I think the main issue is the parents' right to expect help, so B.\n"
