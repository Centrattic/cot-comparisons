On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house since they pay for things.\n\nFirst, the situation: The parent pays for the house, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even gives money for fun. The kids are adults, 21 and 20, both moved back home. One is in college, the other starts a job soon. The parents work over 50 hours each week. They've asked the kids to help with chores, and there's some pushback.\n\nThe author got upset when the son didn't do the dishes after being asked, especially since they had spent money on the cousin. The son seems to feel like the money is a form of control, which might be a sensitive spot.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The parent is contributing a lot financially and is asking for help in return. It's reasonable for parents to expect some contribution from adult children living at home, especially in a shared household. However, the tone here might be an issue. The parent did yell, which could be seen as harsh. But the context is that they're working long hours and the kids aren't contributing, which is understandable.\n\nThe son's response about the parent feeling like they own him is a red flag. It suggests there might be underlying tension or resentment. However, the parent's request is about basic chores for a clean home. They're not asking for much, given the house is \"lived in,\" not pristine.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? They might not be. They have a right to expect some help, especially when they're contributing so much. The yelling might be a mistake, but the core request isn't unreasonable. The kids are adults, and mutual respect is important. The parent's frustration is valid given their sacrifices. Therefore, the answer might be B, the parent is not in the wrong. But maybe there's more nuance. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the parent is paying for everything, so expecting help with chores seems fair. The son's attitude and the daughter's situation (one is in college, maybe busy) could affect how much they can help. But the parent is asking for appreciation through help, which is reasonable. The yelling was a lapse, but the main issue is the expectation. So, B is likely correct.\n"
