On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they pay for everything. The kids moved back home, aren't working (one is in college, the other starting soon), and the parents work long hours. The author gave them money for fun, gas, insurance, and even bought a dresser. When the son didn't do the dishes, the author got angry and mentioned the money they spent.\n\nFirst, the author isn't a clean freak, so expecting some basic help seems reasonable. The kids are adults, so they should contribute to shared responsibilities. It's common for parents to set expectations for chores, especially when providing financial support. The son's comment about the author feeling like they own him is a bit extreme and dismissive. The author is trying to balance their own workload and set boundaries. The kids aren't working, but one is in school, so maybe their priorities are different. However, contributing to household chores is basic and shouldn't be too much to ask. The key is that the author isn't demanding perfection but some appreciation and help. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
