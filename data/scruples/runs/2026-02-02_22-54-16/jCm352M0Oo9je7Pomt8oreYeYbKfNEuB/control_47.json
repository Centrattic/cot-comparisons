On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. They provided the story where the parent is paying for their adult children's expenses and expects help around the house. The children aren't working, one is in college, the other starting soon. The parent got upset when the son didn't do the dishes and mentioned that they paid for their outing with the cousin.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They're covering housing, utilities, food, and other expenses. They feel it's fair for the kids to help maintain the home. The son's response about the parent trying to \"own him\" is a sensitive point. The parent might feel that their generosity should come with some reciprocity.\n\nOn the other hand, the adult children are adults. Even though they're living at home, they might feel that since the parents are paying, they aren't obligated to help. The son's comment about the parent's intent suggests there might be past issues or underlying tension. The parent's reaction to a minor task (dishes) leading to yelling could be seen as disproportionate, especially since they admitted they're not a clean freak.\n\nBut the parent is also working long hours and managing a household. They might be stressed and feeling unappreciated. The fact that the kids are moving back in and the parent is providing significant support could justify some level of help. However, the parent's approach might be too forceful, and yelling could be seen as wrong regardless of the situation.\n\nI should consider cultural norms too. In some cultures, adult children helping at home is expected even if they're not working. In others, it might not be. The key here is the parent's right to expect help versus the children's autonomy. The parent isn't a clean freak, so maybe the expectation isn't unreasonable. However, the parent's reaction might have been too harsh, especially given the son's situation with moving in and setting up his room. Maybe the parent should have communicated expectations better from the start instead of reacting with anger.\n\nAlso, the comment about paying for their outing to imply appreciation might be using guilt, which isn't effective. The son's defensiveness could stem from feeling controlled. The parent might need to set clear boundaries and expectations without making the children feel owned. So while the parent isn't entirely in the wrong for wanting help, their approach and the yelling might place some responsibility on them.\n\nOverall, the parent's frustration is understandable, but their method of expressing it and the son's defensive response suggest that the parent might be in the wrong in how they handled the situation. Hence, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) due to the yelling and using guilt, but I need to check all points again.\n"
