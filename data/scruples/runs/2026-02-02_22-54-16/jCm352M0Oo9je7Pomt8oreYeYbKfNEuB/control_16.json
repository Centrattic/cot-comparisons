On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for expecting their adult children to help around the house, considering they cover expenses like housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun activities. The kids moved back home recently, one is in college, the other starting a job soon. The parent works long hours and is frustrated because the kids aren't contributing with chores. They got angry when the son didn't do the dishes, linking it to previous spending on their cousin's outing.\n\nFirst, the parent is providing significant financial support. It's reasonable to expect some reciprocal help, especially since they're living in a shared space. The kids aren't working yet, but one is in college and the other is starting a job, so it's not like they're completely avoiding responsibility. However, moving back home might mean they're adjusting to new routines. The parent's frustration seems justified because they're managing full-time jobs and household duties. The son's response about feeling owned is a bit extreme and dismissive, which might indicate a communication issue rather than a right or wrong scenario. The parent's request for help isn't unreasonable, especially in a shared living environment. The key here is balance\u2014parents providing for their adult children is common, but expecting basic household responsibilities is also standard. The author isn't wrong for setting these expectations. The answer should be B.\n"
