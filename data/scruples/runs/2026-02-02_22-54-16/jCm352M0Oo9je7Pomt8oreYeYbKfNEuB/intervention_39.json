On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the parent is asking their adult children (21 and 20 years old) to help around the house since they're moving back home and the parents are covering their expenses. The kids are adults, one in college and the other starting a job soon. The parent gives them money for fun, gas, insurance, etc., and works long hours. When the parent asks for help, the son responds with excuses and the parent yells at them for not helping after the parent paid for their cousin's outing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. The parent is providing financial support and housing, which is a significant responsibility. They're asking for some basic help around the house. The kids are adults, so they should be expected to contribute to household chores, especially since they live in the same house. The parent isn't asking for a lot, just cleaning up, doing dishes, etc. The parent also mentions they're not a clean freak, so it's not about perfection but basic cleanliness.\n\nThe son's response seems dismissive. He's living out of a suitcase for three months but now wants to organize his room instead of helping with dishes. That seems like an excuse. The parent got angry and yelled, which is understandable given the frustration. The son also claims the parent's financial support makes him feel owned, which is a problematic mindset. The parent is providing support but not expecting servitude, just mutual respect through contribution.\n\nIn terms of fairness, parents often expect their adult children to help with chores when they live under the same roof, especially when the parents are taking on financial burdens. The parent isn't asking for a lot, just some appreciation and effort. The yelling might be an overreaction, but the core request seems reasonable. The son's attitude is more concerning. The parent is in a position where they're stretched thin with work, so expecting some help is valid. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
