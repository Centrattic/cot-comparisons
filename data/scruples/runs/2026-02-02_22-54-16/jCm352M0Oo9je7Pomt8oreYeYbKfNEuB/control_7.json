Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house in exchange for the financial support they provide.\n\nFirst, the context: The adult kids, 21-year-old son and 20-year-old daughter, moved back home. The parents are covering utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even giving money for fun stuff. Neither child has a job yet, though one is in college and the other starts a job soon. The parents work over 50 hours each week. The author expects help with chores, but the kids aren't doing much. The son even made a comment about the mother paying to \"own\" him.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong to ask for help. Let's consider societal norms and family dynamics. Typically, when parents support adult children financially, it's often expected that the kids contribute around the house. This is part of living in a shared household. The parents are working a lot, so expecting some help is reasonable. The son's attitude seems dismissive and ungrateful, which could be a red flag. The daughter might be part of the problem too, but the example given is about the son.\n\nHowever, the author's approach could be part of the issue. Yelling and using guilt-tripping (like mentioning paying for their cousin's outing) might not be the best communication. The son's comment about feeling owned suggests that the dynamic is tense. The parents might be overstepping if they're treating their children like employees, but in a family setting, some level of contribution is usually expected without payment. \n\nThe key points: Are the parents' expectations reasonable? Yes, helping with chores is typical. Are the children contributing? Not really. Is the author's method of communication appropriate? Maybe not, as yelling can escalate conflicts. But the core issue is the expectation itself, which is not wrong. The children's resentment and lack of help are the problems here. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
