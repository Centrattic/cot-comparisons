On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help with chores since they pay for everything. The author has two adult kids who moved back home, and they\u2019re not working except one is going to college and the other is starting a job soon. The parents work a lot, and the kids aren't contributing much with chores. The son even said that the mom paying for things makes her feel like she owns him.\n\nSo, the author is upset because they pay for the kids' housing, utilities, food, and even some fun expenses, plus gas and insurance. They asked the kids to help around the house, and the son didn't do it, leading to an argument. The author yelled, mentioning that they paid for the kids to take their cousin out.\n\nI need to figure out if the author is wrong here. Well, first, the kids are adults. Expecting them to contribute to household chores is reasonable, especially since they're living under the same roof. The parents are already providing financial support, but chores are part of shared living. However, the parents are working long hours, so their time is valuable. The son's comment about feeling owned is a red flag. It suggests there might be an underlying issue in how the support is framed.\n\nBut the parents aren't forcing the kids to work; they're asking for help. The author's frustration is understandable. They're not being unreasonable to expect some level of contribution, especially when the house is lived-in and they\u2019re working hard. The son's refusal and the daughter's lack of help could be seen as taking the support for granted. However, the author's reaction\u2014to yell and bring up the money\u2014might be problematic. Using guilt or implying that the kids owe them for the expenses could strain the relationship. The key is whether the expectation is reasonable (yes) and how it's communicated (maybe not the best way, but not entirely wrong).\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for expecting help. Adult children should contribute to household chores as part of shared living. The issue might be more about communication style than the expectation itself. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
