On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they're providing financial support.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parents are working over 50 hours each week. Their adult kids, aged 21 and 20, moved back home. The parents cover housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun activities. Neither child has a job yet, though one is starting soon. The parents ask them to help with chores, but the kids aren't doing much. The son specifically said he's busy organizing his new room, and the author got upset when he didn't help with the dishes. The kids also seem to think the author is trying to control them.\n\nNow, considering the age of the children, they're adults. It's reasonable for parents to expect some responsibility in exchange for financial support. The parents aren't asking for perfection, just basic help. The son's response about the author trying to \"own\" him seems dismissive and disrespectful. The author is expressing frustration after providing a lot, which is understandable.\n\nBut wait, the children are in a tough situation too. They might be adjusting to moving back home, and the son is starting a job soon. The daughter is in college. Maybe their expectations are different. However, the parents are working hard and it's a two-way street. The children should contribute where they can, especially since they rely on the parents financially.\n\nThe key here is that the parents are asking for appreciation, which isn't unreasonable. It's about mutual respect and shared responsibilities in a household. The author isn't being a clean freak; they just want basic help. The children's attitude of not wanting to help despite the support the parents provide could be seen as ungrateful.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to expect their adult children to pitch in, especially when they're the ones providing financial support. The children's responses indicate a lack of appreciation, which is the real issue here.\n"
