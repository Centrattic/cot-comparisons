But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they pay for things. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents have two adult kids, a 21-year-old son and a 20-year-old daughter, who both moved back home. The parents are covering the house, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even give money for fun activities. Neither child has a job yet, though one is going to college and the other starts a job soon. The parents work over 50 hours a week. They asked the kids to clean up, and the kids did some things. The mom mentions she's not a clean freak, just a lived-in home.\n\nThe conflict happened when the son was asked to do dishes so she could make dinner. He said he needed to organize his new dresser since he'd been living out of a suitcase for three months. The mom got angry and yelled about them taking her money for their cousin's outing and not showing appreciation. The son responds that since she pays for things, she feels she owns him. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting help in exchange for financial support.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parents are providing significant financial support to their adult children. It's reasonable to expect some reciprocal help, especially when the parents are working long hours. However, the situation might depend on cultural norms and family expectations. In some cultures, adult children are expected to contribute regardless of financial support, while in others, it's seen as the parents' responsibility. The son's comment about being owned could indicate resentment, which the mom might have triggered by linking financial support to chores. But the mom is also stressed from work and wants a livable environment. So, is the mom wrong for expecting help? It's a bit of a gray area. But since they are adults and the parents are setting boundaries, maybe the mom isn't in the wrong. The son's reaction might be part of the problem. The key is whether the expectation of help is reasonable. Since they're adults, asking for help is reasonable, even if they're being paid for other things. So, I think the answer is B (No).\n"
