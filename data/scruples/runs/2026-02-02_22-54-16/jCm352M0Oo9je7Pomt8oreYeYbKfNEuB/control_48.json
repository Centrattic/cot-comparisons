On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a parent with two adult children who moved back home. They pay for everything\u2014house, utilities, food, even gas and insurance. The kids aren't working yet (one in college, the other starting soon). The parents work 50+ hours each. The parent is upset because the kids aren't helping with chores, despite the parent giving them money for fun things. The son specifically made a comment about the parent paying to feel like they own him, which is really hurtful.\n\nFirst, the parent's argument is about fairness. They\u2019re providing financial support and expecting some household help in return. But the kids aren't working, which might affect their ability or willingness to contribute. However, even if they're not working, contributing around the house is a basic expectation in many families. The parent isn't a clean freak, just wants a lived-in home. \n\nThe son's response about the parent feeling ownership is problematic. It's a very disrespectful way to frame it. The parent is asking for appreciation and help, not control. The key here is whether the parent is entitled to expect help in exchange for financial support. In many cultures, that's a common expectation. The parent isn't asking for a lot\u2014just basic chores. The kids have been given resources, so expecting some reciprocation isn't unreasonable. \n\nBut wait, the parent does mention giving money for fun things. Is that part of the issue? The parent feels they should get help in return for all they provide. The son's attitude is dismissive, even going as far as implying the parent has ulterior motives. That's definitely not helping. The parent's frustration is valid. They\u2019re working hard, contributing to their kids' lives, and the lack of gratitude and help is causing tension. \n\nHowever, the parent might need to consider how their request is framed. Demanding help might come off as controlling, but in this case, the parent is asking for appreciation, not servitude. The kids are adults, so they have the right to their own opinions, but they also have a responsibility to contribute where they can. The parent isn't wrong for wanting some support in maintaining the household they're living in. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The parent isn't in the wrong for expecting help, especially since they\u2019re providing financial support. The kids' responses are disrespectful and ungrateful. The parent's frustration is justified given the effort they\u2019re putting into supporting their children. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
