On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is at fault for expecting their adult children to help around the house since they pay for things. The parent has two adult kids who moved back home, neither has a job yet (one is in college, the other starting soon). The parent works long hours, and they're frustrated because the kids aren't contributing with chores.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent is covering all the expenses: housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun. They're asking for help with basic chores. The kids are adults, so there's an expectation of independence. But they're still in a dependent situation financially.\n\nThe parent got upset when their son didn't do the dishes, especially after they'd paid for a dinner outing. The son's response about feeling owned by the parent's financial support might be a defense mechanism. The parent's anger is understandable given their sacrifices, but perhaps the approach was too harsh. Yelling might not be the best way to enforce responsibility. \n\nHowever, the parent isn't unreasonable in expecting some reciprocation. It's a balancing act between providing support and fostering independence. The kids might feel pressured if they perceive the support as conditional on chores. The parent might need to communicate expectations clearly without using guilt or anger. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parent isn't in the wrong for wanting help. But the method of enforcement could be improved. However, the options are A (yes, parent is in the wrong) or B (no). Given that the parent's request is reasonable, but their reaction was harsh, but overall, the core issue is valid. So the answer is B.\n"
