On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for expecting their adult children to help around the house. The situation is that both kids moved back home, the parents are covering all the expenses, and the children aren't working yet. The parents work long hours, and the author got upset when the son didn't help with chores.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boundaries here. The children are adults, so there's an expectation that they should contribute to household responsibilities. Even if they're not working, it's reasonable to ask for help with chores. The author mentioned that they're not a clean freak and the house is \"lived in,\" so the expectations aren't unreasonable.\n\nThe son's response about the author paying for the outing and feeling like ownership might be a bit harsh. The parents are providing financial support, which is significant, and expecting some reciprocation through chores isn't unreasonable. The author did ask them to help, and when they didn't, they expressed frustration. However, yelling after getting angry might have been a harsh reaction, but the underlying request for help isn't wrong.\n\nAlso, the son's attitude that the money makes the author feel like they \"own him\" seems like a misinterpretation. The parents are supporting them, which is a common situation when adult children move back home. It's not about ownership but shared household responsibilities. The author's frustration is valid given the amount of support provided.\n\nSo, the key points are: adult children should contribute, the parents are providing substantial support, and asking for help with chores is reasonable. The author's approach might have been a bit heated, but their position isn't wrong. The answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
