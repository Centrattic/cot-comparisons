On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for expecting their adult children to help around the house. The author is providing financial support for their 21-year-old son and 20-year-old daughter, including rent, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun things. Both kids are back home within the past year, and one is in college, the other starting a job soon. The parents work over 50 hours each week.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations of the parents versus the actions of the children. The parents are clearly contributing a lot financially and are working long hours. They're asking for some basic help around the house, like doing dishes. The son's response seems dismissive, focusing on personal tasks instead of contributing. The daughter is mentioned as doing a couple of things, so maybe she's somewhat helpful.\n\nThe author got angry and yelled, pointing out the financial contributions as a reason for expecting help. The son's reaction that the parent's payments make him feel owned is a sensitive issue. The parents might feel they're being taken advantage of, but the children might feel entitled to the help without obligation.\n\nI need to consider societal norms. Adult children moving back in, especially after college, often expect some level of support from parents. However, mutual respect and shared responsibilities are important in any household. The parents are working hard and managing a lot, so expecting some help is reasonable. The problem might be the communication style\u2014yelling could have escalated things. However, the core issue is the expectation of help for the support provided.\n\nIn many cultures, it's common for adult children to contribute to household chores, especially when they're living at home and receiving financial support. The parents aren't unreasonable in asking for this. The son's attitude and the daughter's lack of consistent help are the main issues here. The parents are not in the wrong for expressing their expectations, especially given the level of support they're providing. The AITA question hinges on whether it's fair to expect help in exchange for financial support, which I think it is. So the answer should be B.\n"
