On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house in exchange for financial support.\n\nFirst, the author has two adult children living at home. They pay for housing, utilities, food, plus extra for fun things, gas, and insurance. Neither has a job yet, one is in college, the other starting soon. The parents work over 50 hours each. The author is asking the kids to help with chores, like cleaning up and doing dishes. When the son ignores a request to do dishes, the author gets angry and mentions the money spent on their cousin.\n\nI need to think about expectations. Are the parents wrong to ask for help? Well, the kids are adults. Even though they're moving back in, it's reasonable to expect some household responsibilities. The author isn't being a clean freak; the house is \"very lived in.\" So maybe the expectations are reasonable. The author is providing financial support, but that doesn't negate the need for the kids to contribute in other ways.\n\nThe son's response seems dismissive, implying that the money makes the author feel like an owner, which is a bit passive-aggressive. The author's reaction to the son's refusal by bringing up the cousin outing might be a bit unfair, but it's understandable frustration. The author isn't wrong to want appreciation and help in return for financial support. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's expectations are reasonable. They're working hard, providing for the kids, and asking for basic help. The kids not contributing might be the issue. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
