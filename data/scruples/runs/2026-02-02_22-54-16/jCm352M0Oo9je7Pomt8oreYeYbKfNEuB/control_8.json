On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house in exchange for the financial support they provide. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The children are adults, 21 and 20 years old. Both moved back home within the past year. The parents are covering housing, utilities, food, and extras like gas, insurance, and fun activities. The parents work over 50 hours a week each, so they're pretty busy. The kids aren't working right now, one is in college, and the other is starting a job soon.\n\nThe main issue here is the expectation of help with chores. The mother asked the son to do the dishes, and he responded by focusing on setting up his new dresser. She then got angry and mentioned the money she spends on them, suggesting they should show appreciation. The son's response implies he feels the financial support is a form of control rather than an expectation of help.\n\nSo, is the mother in the wrong? Well, the kids are adults. Even though they're living at home, their parents are providing significant financial support. It's reasonable for the parents to expect some level of contribution, especially in chores. However, the parents might need to consider if the expectations are clear and if the kids are in a position to help. The son is still adjusting, having lived out of a suitcase for three months. Maybe they need more time to settle in. \n\nThe mother's reaction of yelling and bringing up the money might have been harsh, but that doesn't necessarily mean she's wrong in expecting help. The key is balance. The parents are covering a lot, and it's normal to want some reciprocity. On the other hand, the kids are in a transitional phase, and the parents should communicate expectations clearly without making the kids feel controlled. \n\nThe son's comment that the money is making him feel owned is a red flag. It suggests there might be underlying issues or resentment. The parents might need to address this without being punitive. But in terms of the initial question, the mother's stance isn't unreasonable. She's asking for appreciation through helping, which is a common expectation in many families. However, the method of communication (yelling) was poor. \n\nIn conclusion, while the mother isn't entirely in the wrong, the situation is complex. The answer might hinge on whether the parents' expectations are reasonable given the children's current circumstances and how they communicate these expectations. Since the core question is whether she's in the wrong for asking, the answer is likely B (No), but with the note that the approach could be improved.\n"
