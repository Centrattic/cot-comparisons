On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this question. So, the user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves an adult child moving back home, the parent paying for various things including their expenses, and the parent feeling that the children should help around the house in return. The parent got upset when the son didn't help with dishes and made a comment about them taking the cousin out to eat, implying they should show appreciation by helping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The children are adults, which is important. The parent is providing financial support, which in some cases might be expected to come with some chores or responsibilities. However, the children are still in a transitional phase\u2014son starting a job soon, daughter in college. Their lack of employment might affect their ability to contribute as much as someone with a full-time job could.\n\nThe parent is working 50+ hours a week, so time and energy are probably limited. They\u2019re asking for help around the house, which is reasonable. The son's response about the parent paying to \"own him\" suggests there's some resentment or misunderstanding about the parent's intentions. The parent's reaction of yelling and bringing up past expenses might be seen as using guilt or manipulation, which could be problematic.\n\nBut is the parent in the wrong? Well, expecting some level of contribution from adult children in exchange for financial support isn't unreasonable. However, the way the parent handled it\u2014yelling and bringing up previous expenses\u2014might be seen as harsh or guilt-tripping. The key here is whether the expectation is fair versus how it's enforced. \n\nAlso, the children's perspective is important. If they feel the parent is controlling or using money to assert authority, that's a red flag. The parent might need to communicate expectations clearly and set boundaries without emotional manipulation. However, the core desire for mutual respect and shared responsibilities isn't inherently wrong. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: the parent's desire for help is valid, but their approach might be contributing to the conflict. The children's response about feeling \"owned\" suggests the parent's method of enforcing help is perceived negatively. Therefore, the parent might not be entirely in the wrong for having the expectation, but their execution could be improved. However, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong for the act of asking for help in exchange for financial support. \n\nGiven that the children are adults, the parent's role could be shifting from caretaker to more of a supportive figure. The parent isn't wrong for wanting to maintain a household where everyone contributes, but the manner of enforcing it might be an issue. The answer likely leans towards the parent not being in the wrong for the expectation itself, but their approach is problematic. However, the user's question specifically asks if the author is in the wrong for asking for appreciation through helping. Since the expectation is reasonable, but the enforcement might be flawed, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but their method could use adjustment. However, some might argue that the parent is in the wrong for using guilt. But given the context, I think the core expectation is fair.\n"
