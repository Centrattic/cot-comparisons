      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author has two adult children, 21-year-old son and 20-year-old daughter, who both moved back home in the past year. The parents are covering the house, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even giving money for fun things. Neither child has a job yet, but the daughter is in college and the son is starting a job soon. The parents work over 50 hours each week. They asked the kids to help around the house, and they did a bit. The author isn't a clean freak; the house is just \"lived in.\"\n\nThe issue arises when the son was living out of a suitcase for 3 months, and they bought him a dresser. The author asked him to do the dishes so she could make dinner, but he said he needed to put his clothes in the new dresser. The author got angry and yelled, mentioning that they spent money on taking their cousin out to eat and drink the night before, expecting some appreciation through helping out. The son responds by saying the author pays for things so she can feel like she owns him.\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong for expecting appreciation and help with chores. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants the AI's opinion.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The children are adults, so they're supposed to be independent. However, they're moving back home, likely due to life circumstances (college, starting a job). The parents are supporting them financially, which is common for adult children, but the parents are working a lot and want help around the house.\n\nThe author's request is for the children to help clean up, which is a reasonable expectation in a shared household. The son's response that he needs to focus on his own tasks (organizing his new dresser) might seem dismissive, but considering he's been living in a suitcase for months and just got a dresser, maybe he's still settling in. However, the son is starting a job soon, which might mean he's transitioning to more independence.\n\nThe author's reaction was yelling, which could be seen as harsh. But she's also stressed, working long hours, and possibly feeling unappreciated. The son's comment about feeling owned is problematic because it's a hostile response, implying that financial support is a form of control rather than support.\n\nIn terms of fairness, parents often expect some level of contribution from adult children living at home, especially when they're contributing financially. However, the line can be blurry. The author is asking for help in exchange for support, which isn't unreasonable. The children might be in a position where they're not working yet, but that doesn't mean they can't help with chores. The son's attitude here is disrespectful, and the author's frustration is valid. But the yelling part might be seen as overreacting, especially if the kids haven't been helping much.\n\nThe daughter is in college, which might take time and effort, so maybe she's less available. The son is about to start a job but still seems to be avoiding responsibilities. The author's main point is about appreciation and contributing to the household. The son's response suggests he's resentful, which complicates things. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong for expecting help and appreciation. It's reasonable to ask for some chores in exchange for financial support. However, the way she expressed her frustration (yelling) might not be the best approach. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the method. The son's attitude is definitely an issue here. So the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
