On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house in exchange for financial support. The author has two adult kids back home, both not working yet, one in college, the other starting soon. The parents work long hours. The author pays for utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even gives money for fun. They asked the kids to clean up, and when they didn't do enough, the author got angry and yelled about the money spent, like taking the cousin out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many cultures, it's common for parents to expect some level of contribution from adult children, especially if they're still living at home and being supported. The author mentions they're not a clean freak, so the expectations are reasonable. The kids are getting a lot of financial support, so expecting chores might be fair.\n\nThe son's response about the parents paying to feel they own him is a red flag. That suggests there's some resentment or manipulation from the kid. The parents are trying to set boundaries, but the child feels controlled. However, the author's frustration is understandable. They're working hard, providing for the kids, and when asked to contribute, the kids don't. The author's reaction, yelling, might be a bit harsh, but the underlying request for help isn't unreasonable.\n\nAlso, the daughter and son did some things before, so maybe the author's approach worked to some extent. The problem is the recent pushback. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for expecting appreciation through chores. Since the kids are adults, they should contribute to household responsibilities as a matter of fairness. The financial support doesn't negate the need for mutual respect and shared responsibilities in a household. The author's position seems reasonable, so they are not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
