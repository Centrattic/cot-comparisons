He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author has two adult children, 21 and 20 years old, who moved back home. They\u2019re not working, one is in college, the other starting a job soon. The author provides housing, utilities, food, and even money for fun stuff, gas, and insurance. They work over 50 hours a week. The author asked the kids to clean up, but they didn't do much. The son didn't do the dishes when asked, so the author got angry and yelled about them taking the cousin out and feeling like the money makes the kids feel owned.\n\nHmm, so the author's main point is that since they pay for everything, the kids should help out. The kids are adults, so there's an expectation of contributing. But maybe there's a cultural factor here. In some families, it's normal for adult children to help, even if they're not working. But then again, the kids are in a situation where they might be adjusting\u2014moving back after being on their own, dealing with school or starting a job.\n\nThe author got upset when the son prioritized setting up his room over doing dishes. The author feels their demands are reasonable given the financial support. The kids' response is that the money makes them feel like they're owned, which is a valid emotional reaction. But does that mean the author is wrong to expect help?\n\nFrom a typical parenting perspective, it's common for parents to expect some household responsibilities from adult children, especially when the family is under financial strain. The author isn't a clean freak, just wants a lived-in home. The son's argument about the money leading to a sense of ownership might stem from feeling pressured or unappreciated. However, the author is also working long hours and trying to manage a household. It's a balance between respect for the children's autonomy and the parents' needs.\n\nI think the key points are: 1) the children are adults, 2) the parents are providing significant financial support, 3) the parents are working hard, 4) the children are not working yet. The author is asking for a reciprocal effort in housework. Expecting help is reasonable, but the way it's approached matters. Yelling and using guilt (like mentioning the cousin outing) might not be constructive. However, the author's frustration is understandable given the workload. So, is the author in the wrong? Probably not, because contributing to household chores is a common expectation. The children's resistance might be about communication or maturity. So the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
