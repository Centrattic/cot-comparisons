On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help with housework in exchange for the financial support they provide. The parent has two adult kids, both moved back in, and the parents are working long hours. The kids aren't working (though one is starting soon and the other is in college). The parent gave them a dresser after they were living out of suitcases for three months. The parent got angry when the son refused to do dishes, mentioning that they paid for their outing with the cousin.\n\nFirst, the parent is providing significant financial support: housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun. They\u2019re asking for appreciation through housework. The kids are adults, so there's an expectation of mutual respect and responsibility. The parent isn't a clean freak, so it's not about perfection. The son's response about the parent feeling ownership over him is a red flag\u2014it suggests a possible power dynamic or past issues.\n\nBut the parent's frustration is understandable. They're contributing a lot and expecting some reciprocation. The kids are in a position where they benefit from the parents' resources, so contributing to household chores as a sign of appreciation isn't unreasonable. However, the parent's reaction (yelling) might have been harsh. Instead of framing it as \"since I pay, you must help,\" a more collaborative approach could be better. But the core issue is the expectation itself. \n\nIs it fair to ask for help? Yes, especially when the parent is working long hours. The problem might be how it's communicated rather than the expectation itself. The son's comment about the parent feeling ownership could indicate deeper issues, but the parent's basic request for help isn't necessarily wrong. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong), but there's room for reflection on communication style.\n"
