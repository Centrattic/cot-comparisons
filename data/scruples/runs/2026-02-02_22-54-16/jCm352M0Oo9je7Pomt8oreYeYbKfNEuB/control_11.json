On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house, given that they pay for various expenses. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the children are adults, 21 and 20, who moved back home. The parents are covering utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun. The parents work long hours, over 50 each. They asked the kids to help with chores, and the son responded by prioritizing his own tasks, like organizing his new dresser. The author got upset and mentioned that the kids took their cousin out for dinner/drinks, implying they should be grateful and help out. The son's response suggests he feels the money is a form of ownership, which is likely a deflection.\n\nSo, the core of the issue is whether the parents are wrong to expect help in exchange for their financial support. The parents aren't expecting perfection, just some appreciation. The kids aren't working (though one starts soon), and one is in college. \n\nFrom a societal standpoint, many might argue that adult children should contribute to household chores, especially since they're living under the same roof and being supported financially. However, the parents aren't being unreasonable in their expectations. The son's attitude is problematic, but does that mean the parents are in the wrong? Probably not. They're setting boundaries and trying to maintain a balanced home environment. The son's behavior and the way he frames the parents' support as ownership is a red flag, but the parents are justified in asking for basic help. \n\nPossible counterarguments: The parents are paying for everything, so maybe the kids shouldn't have to help. But in many families, even with financial support, chores are part of living in a household. The parents are also working hard and might need the help. The kids aren't being asked to do much, just basic clean-up. \n\nAnother angle: The son's response about feeling owned is a manipulation tactic. The parents are trying to foster responsibility and gratitude, which is reasonable. The fact that the parents are not a clean freak and the house is 'lived in' shows they're not expecting perfection, just some effort. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They have a right to expect some level of contribution from their adult children, especially given the financial support and their own workload. The son's behavior is the issue here, not the parents' expectations.\n"
