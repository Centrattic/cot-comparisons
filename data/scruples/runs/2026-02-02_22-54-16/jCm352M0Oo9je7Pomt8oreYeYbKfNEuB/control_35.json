On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they're paying for everything. \n\nFirst, the children are adults, 21 and 20, living at home. The parents are paying for the house, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even giving money for fun activities. The kids aren't working yet, one is in college, the other starting soon. The parents work over 50 hours each.\n\nThe author mentions that they asked the kids to clean up, and while they did a couple things, there's tension. The son ignored a request to do the dishes, citing he needed to organize his new dresser. The author got angry and mentioned the money spent on the cousin outing, leading to an argument about the son feeling owned.\n\nNow, the key points here are expectations. The parents are providing financial support but not getting help. The kids are in a transitional phase, which is common for young adults. But since they're adults, the parents might reasonably expect some domestic help. However, the author's response was yelling and bringing up the money, which might be seen as guilt-tripping. \n\nThe son's reaction about feeling owned by the mother's payments is a valid emotional response. The parents do pay for a lot, so expecting help isn't unreasonable, but the way the author handled it could be seen as harsh. However, the core issue is the imbalance: parents working a lot and paying for everything, while the kids aren't contributing. \n\nSo, is the author at fault? The expectation itself isn't wrong, but the approach might be. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the main thing is if their demand for help is justified. Since the kids are adults and the household is shared, expecting help is reasonable. The author isn't wrong for asking for appreciation and help. The son's attitude might be part of the problem too. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
