On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they're being supported financially. The author provides context: the kids are over 21, moved back home, neither has a job yet (one in college, the other starting soon), and the parents work long hours. The parents give money for fun, gas, insurance, etc. The son and daughter are supposed to help with chores, but the son recently responded in a way that made the parent angry, especially after they paid for the kids to take their cousin out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around adult children and household responsibilities. In many cultures, it's common for adults to contribute to household chores if they live under the same roof, especially when their parents are covering expenses. The parents are providing not just a roof but also financial support for things beyond basic needs. The children might be seen as beneficiaries of this support, so expecting some level of help with chores is reasonable.\n\nHowever, the user's son's response that the money makes the parent feel like they \"own him\" is problematic. It suggests a conflict in the dynamic. The parent is trying to set boundaries and expectations, while the child is pushing back, possibly feeling entitled or unappreciated. The parent's frustration is understandable given their workload and the financial burden. But did they overstep?\n\nThe key points here are: the parent is not a clean freak, the kids are supposed to help, and the parent is asking for appreciation through chores. The parent's outburst about taking the cousin out might have been a misstep, as it could come off as accusatory or manipulative. However, the core expectation of helping around the house is reasonable. Since the children are adults, they should contribute. The parent isn't wrong for expecting that, even if the communication could be improved. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
