On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house given that they pay for various things. The situation is that the kids moved back home, and the parents work long hours. The parents give money for fun, gas, insurance, etc. The kids don't have jobs yet, one is in college, the other starting soon. The parents ask them to clean up, and when they don't, the parent gets upset and accuses them of thinking they're owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. The parents are providing financial support, which is a significant contribution. They're asking for basic household help in return. It's common for parents to expect some level of contribution from adult children living at home, especially when there's a financial commitment involved. The kids, on the other hand, might feel that since the parents are paying, they don't need to help. But that might not be a realistic expectation. \n\nThe parent mentions that they're not a clean freak, so it's not about perfection but basic maintenance. The son's response about the parent trying to feel like they own him is a possible deflection. The parent's frustration is understandable, given the effort and money they're putting in. The question is whether expecting help is unreasonable. \n\nIn many families, there's an understanding that living at home with financial support includes some responsibilities. The parents are working long hours and want the house to function smoothly. The children's lack of jobs might mean they have time to contribute, even if they're in school. The parent isn't demanding a lot, just some appreciation through helping. \n\nIt's also worth considering the dynamic here. The parent's outburst about owing them might have been a bit harsh, but the underlying expectation isn't unreasonable. The key is whether the parent is in the wrong for having that expectation. Since the children are adults, it's reasonable to ask for help. The parent isn't wrong for wanting a fair balance. So the answer is B.\n"
