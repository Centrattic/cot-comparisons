On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author pays for their adult children who moved back home, and expects them to help around the house. They got upset when the son didn't do the dishes as requested, especially since they had just spent money on their cousin.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. The author is providing financial support (house, utilities, food, gas, insurance, fun money) and wants help with chores. The kids are 21 and 20, so adults. One is in college, the other starting a job soon. The parents work long hours. They asked for help, and the son didn't comply, leading to an argument.\n\nThe key points here are: Is it reasonable to expect adult children living at home to contribute with chores when the parents are covering their expenses? The author isn't a clean freak, just wants the house lived in. The son's response about the author paying to feel in control is a bit confrontational. The author's frustration seems justified given the financial support and the request being for basic chores.\n\nIn many cases, when adults live at home, it's common for parents to expect some household responsibilities. The author isn't demanding perfection but basic help. The son's lack of action despite being asked multiple times might be seen as ungrateful. The author's reaction to the son's excuse (organizing his new dresser) could be seen as valid since he's been in the house for three months and the task isn't urgent. Plus, the mention of spending money on the cousin could be a valid point about reciprocity.\n\nBut maybe some might argue that the parents shouldn't expect chores because the kids are not working yet, but the author is paying for their needs and wants help in return. It's a balance between support and mutual respect. The author's tone might be harsh, but the underlying request is reasonable. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
