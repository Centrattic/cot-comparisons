On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house since they pay for their expenses. The adult kids moved back home, and the parents are working long hours. The parents give money for fun, gas, insurance, etc., while the kids aren't working, though one is starting school soon. The author got upset when their son didn't do the dishes after they'd paid for a dinner outing for their cousin.\n\nFirst, the parents are providing financial support, which is a big deal. Adult children living at home often have some expectations of help, especially when the parents are working a lot. The kids aren't working, but one is in college. The author's frustration is about getting appreciation through chores. The son's response that the parent's payments make him feel owned is a bit extreme, maybe defensive. \n\nBut wait, is it fair to expect chores in exchange for room and board? Some people might think it's reasonable to ask for basic help, especially when the parent is contributing financially and working long hours. The author isn't a clean freak, just wants some help. The kids did a couple of things already. The son's excuse about setting up his room after 3 months might not hold up\u2014maybe he should prioritize helping with dinner. \n\nThe key points are that the parents are providing a lot, but expecting some reciprocity. The kids might feel entitled, but the parents aren't being unreasonable. The author's anger might be justified given the circumstances. So, probably answer B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
