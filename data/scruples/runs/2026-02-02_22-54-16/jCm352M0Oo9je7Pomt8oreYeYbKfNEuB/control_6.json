On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they pay for their expenses. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The adult children are 21 and 20, both moved back home in the past year. They're not working, one is in college, the other starts soon. The parents work over 50 hours each week. The parents provide housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun things. The problem is that the kids aren't helping with chores despite being asked.\n\nThe author got upset when their son didn't do the dishes, mentioning that they paid for them to take their cousin out. The son feels like the money is a way for the parents to feel they \"own\" him. The key here is whether the author is wrong for expecting help in exchange for their support.\n\nIn many cultures, it's common for adult children to contribute to household chores when living at home, especially if they're still in education or transitioning into work. The parents are providing significant financial support, which could be seen as a form of investment, and expecting some reciprocation in terms of household responsibilities is reasonable. However, the son's resentment and the parent's reaction might be causing tension. \n\nBut the parents are working long hours and it's reasonable to expect help maintaining the home. The fact that the son is living out of a suitcase for three months and then getting a dresser might indicate that he's still settling in, but that doesn't mean he's not expected to help. The daughter might also be involved if they both moved back. \n\nThe parent's frustration is understandable. They're providing a lot, and some help with chores is a small ask. The son's comment about feeling owned is problematic, but the parent's expectation isn't unreasonable. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They have a right to expect some help, especially given their contribution. However, communication might be an issue. The parent might need to approach it differently, perhaps setting clear expectations without making it about ownership. But the core of the question is whether the parent is wrong, and based on the context, the answer is B.\n"
