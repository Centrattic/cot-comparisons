On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they're paying for things. The author has two adult kids who moved back in, neither has a job yet, and they're being given money for fun things, gas, insurance, etc. The parent works long hours and is asking for help with chores. The kids did some things but not enough, and when the parent asked for more, there was a conflict. The son even accused the parent of trying to own him, which is pretty harsh.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The kids are adults, so the parent isn't obligated to support them financially. However, in many cultures, it's common for parents to help adult children, especially if they're going to school or starting a job. But when it's expected in return to contribute to household chores, that's reasonable. The parent is providing a home and financial support, so expecting some level of help in return is understandable. After all, it's a shared living space, and chores are part of maintaining it.\n\nThe son's response about feeling owned is a red flag. That suggests resentment or manipulation, which isn't healthy. The parent is asking for appreciation through help, not control. The fact that the kids are using the parent's financial support to take their cousin out for meals might be a point of contention. The parent is upset that despite their generosity, there's a lack of reciprocation in housework. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of the parent's own behavior. Yelling and getting angry might not be the best approach. Maybe a more constructive conversation could help. But the parent's frustration is valid given their sacrifices. The key issue is the balance between providing support and expecting mutual respect and contribution. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the parent isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and expecting some help. The kids' response is problematic, but the parent's actions are reasonable. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
