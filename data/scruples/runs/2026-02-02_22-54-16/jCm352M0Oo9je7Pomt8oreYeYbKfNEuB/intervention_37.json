On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house. The author has two kids back home, both adults, and they're paying for their housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even giving money for fun things. The kids don't have jobs, though one is in college and the other is starting soon. The author asked them to help with chores, but when they didn't, the author got upset and yelled, especially after the kids went out with a cousin and the son responded that the author's payments make him feel owned.\n\nHmm, first, the author is providing a lot of support. It's common for parents to expect some help when they're covering so much. The kids are adults, so maybe they should contribute. But the author's reaction was yelling and bringing up the money, which might have been harsh. The son's response about feeling owned is a red flag\u2014it suggests there might be an underlying issue or that the author's communication is making them feel resentful.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to expect some responsibility from their adult children. On the other hand, yelling and using guilt might not be effective. The author's frustration is valid, but the way they expressed it could be problematic. The key points are the kids' responses feeling resentful and the author's approach. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong for expecting help, but their method of enforcing it might be flawed. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since the core issue is the expectation of help, and the author's actions stem from providing for the kids, the answer might be B (No), but with some nuance about communication style. But the main question is about being in the wrong, not effectiveness. So probably B.\n"
