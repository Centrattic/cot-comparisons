On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they pay for things. The author's kids are 21 and 20, both moved back home recently. They don't have jobs yet, one is in college, the other starting soon. The parents work long hours and provide housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, etc. The author gets upset when the kids don't help with chores and yelled about it after they took a trip with their cousin.\n\nHmm. So the main issue is whether the parent is justified in expecting appreciation through housework. The author isn't a clean freak, just wants the house to be \"lived in,\" which isn't unreasonable. The kids are adults, so the parent might feel they should contribute. But they're also not working yet, which might affect their ability or willingness to help. \n\nThe son's response about the parent paying for things to feel like they own him is a bit concerning. It suggests some underlying tension or resentment. The parent is frustrated because they're providing financial support and expects some reciprocation. However, it's a common debate whether parents have the right to expect chores from adult children living at home. \n\nOn one hand, the parent is covering a lot, and it's fair to want some help. On the other hand, the kids are still in a transitional phase, with school and starting jobs. They might be overwhelmed. But the parent is working hard and perhaps overworked, so needing assistance makes sense. The parent's reaction of yelling might be a problem, but the core issue is the expectation. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to expect some help, especially when they're providing so much. The kids being adults should contribute, even if they're not working yet. So the answer is B.\n"
