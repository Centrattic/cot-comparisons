On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is at fault for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they're paying for a lot. The kids are 21 and 20, both moved back home, and neither has a job yet. The parent pays for housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even extra things. They work 50+ hours each. The children did some chores but not enough, and the parent got upset when the son prioritized moving his clothes over doing the dishes. The son also had a sarcastic comment about the parent's money being a way to control him.\n\nFirst, the parent's request for help seems reasonable. They're contributing a lot financially, and expecting some reciprocal help isn't unreasonable. The kids are adults, so it's fair to ask for basic chores. The parent isn't a clean freak, just wants a lived-in home. The son's response that the parent pays to \"own\" him is a bit extreme and ungrateful. The parent is trying to balance work and home, and the children's lack of help adds stress. The parent's frustration is valid. The children have some responsibilities now, especially since they're adults. The parent isn't wrong for setting boundaries. So, the answer is B.\n"
