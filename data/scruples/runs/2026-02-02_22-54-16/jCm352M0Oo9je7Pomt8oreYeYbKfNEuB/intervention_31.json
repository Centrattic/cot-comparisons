On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they're paying for things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The parents have two adult kids who moved back home. The parents cover housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even give money for fun stuff. The kids aren't working yet; one is in college, the other starts a job soon. The parents work long hours. The kids have been asked to help with chores, which they did a bit. The mom got upset when the son didn't do the dishes and mentioned the money they spent on them taking their cousin out. The son accuses her of trying to own him through money.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether the parents are wrong for expecting help. The mom argues it's about appreciation. The son feels the money is given to make him feel indebted. \n\nFrom a traditional perspective, many parents expect their adult children to contribute chores when living at home, especially if the family is providing for them. However, the parents are clearly working hard and the kids are in a transitional phase. The son's response seems dismissive, which might be frustrating. \n\nBut some might argue that the parents shouldn't have to pay for all the kids' needs and expect help, especially if the kids have their own responsibilities like school. The son's comment about owing the parent could indicate resentment, which might be the parent's fault if they're using money as a way to control. \n\nHowever, the parent is asking for a household contribution, which is reasonable. The key here is whether the parent's expectations are unreasonable. Since the kids are getting a lot of financial support, expecting some chores in return isn't out of line. The parent isn't demanding perfection, just basic help. The son's attitude might be the real issue here. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent might be contributing too much financially and not setting boundaries. But given the context, their request for help seems fair. The answer is likely B, the parent isn't in the wrong. The son's behavior is problematic, not the parent's expectation of help.\n"
