      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has two adult kids, 21 and 20, who moved back home. They're not working, one is in college, the other starting soon. The parents work over 50 hours a week and provide housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun. The kids aren't contributing much around the house. The author asked the son to do dishes, but he was focused on his own stuff. The author got angry, yelling about the money they spent on taking the cousin out and the son's attitude about owing them.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the parents are supporting their adult children financially in a significant way, and they feel it's reasonable to expect some chores in return. The kids aren't pulling their weight, which is causing tension. The son's response about the author feeling like the author owns him is a red flag. It suggests a power dynamic issue.\n\nNow, considering societal norms, it's common for parents to expect some help from adult children, especially when they're living under the same roof. The parents are not asking for a lot\u2014just basic chores to maintain the household. The fact that they've worked hard to provide for them and still manage their own demanding jobs adds to the justification. However, the way the author expressed their frustration\u2014yelling and bringing up past expenses\u2014might be seen as confrontational. They might need to approach it more calmly.\n\nBut the core issue is whether expecting help is unreasonable. The author is not a clean freak, so it's not about perfection. The kids are adults, so they should understand the value of contributing. The son's attitude is problematic because he frames the support as the author's way to control him, which isn't fair. The parents are providing out of support, not control. \n\nThe answer hinges on balancing the parents' right to expect respect and help versus the children's autonomy. Since the parents are providing substantial support, expecting some reciprocal effort isn't unreasonable. The author isn't entirely in the wrong, but they could improve their communication. The son's response is more toxic. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
