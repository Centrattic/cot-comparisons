On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house since they pay for things. The author has two adult kids who moved back home, and they're covering expenses like housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun. The kids aren't working yet, but one is in college and the other starts a job soon. The author works over 50 hours a week with their spouse. They asked the kids to help clean, and when they didn't do enough, the author got angry and yelled about expecting appreciation.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting help in exchange for financial support. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the general expectations in parent-child relationships. Adult children moving back home is common, especially after college or during job transitions. However, expectations around chores and contribution can vary. The author is providing significant financial support, and it's reasonable to expect some level of help in return, especially if the household is shared. The kids are not working yet, but they're still part of a household where chores are necessary for everyone's well-being.\n\nThe author mentions they're not a clean freak and have a \"very lived in home,\" so maybe the expectations aren't unreasonable. The son's response about the author paying to \"feel like they own him\" is a bit concerning. It suggests there might be underlying issues in their communication or the son's perception of the situation. The author's frustration is understandable, given the workload and financial contributions.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether the request is fair. Asking adult children to contribute to household chores is common and reasonable. However, the author did yell, which might have been an overreaction. The key here is whether the request is excessive or if the author's response was disproportionate. The author provided context about the financial support and the kids' lack of contribution, so their frustration is valid. However, yelling and making accusations (like implying the son feels owned) could escalate tensions. The author might be in the right in expecting help but in the wrong in the way they expressed it. But the question is specifically about being in the wrong for the situation, not the response's tone.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because it's reasonable to expect reciprocal help. The financial support is substantial, and asking for basic chores is a fair request. The son's resistance might stem from differing expectations or a sense of entitlement, but the author's position isn't unreasonable. The answer might be B (no), as the author isn't wrong for expecting help in exchange for support, even if the communication could be improved.\n"
