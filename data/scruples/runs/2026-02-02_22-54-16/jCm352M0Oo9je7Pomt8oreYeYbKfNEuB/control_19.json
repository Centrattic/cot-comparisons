But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the parent has two adult children who moved back home. The parents are paying for their housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even giving them money for fun things. The kids don't have jobs yet, one is in college, the other starting soon. The parents work a lot, over 50 hours each week. The parent is asking the children to help around the house, like doing dishes or cleaning, but the kids aren't really doing it. When the parent confronts them, the son says that since the parents pay for things, he feels like the parent owns him. The parent gets angry and yells about the kids not showing appreciation.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author (the parent) is in the wrong for expecting help with chores in exchange for financial support.\n\nFirst, let's consider the parent's perspective. They are providing significant financial support, which is a big responsibility. They work long hours and want their home to be livable. It's reasonable for them to expect some contribution from the kids, especially since they're living in the house. The parent isn't a clean freak, just wants a \"very lived in home,\" so maybe not super strict about it. But even so, basic chores like dishes or cleaning up after oneself are common in shared households.\n\nOn the other hand, the children are adults, but they might be adjusting to moving back home. The son has been living out of a suitcase for three months, so maybe he's still in a transition phase. The daughter is 20 and the son 21, so they might not have much experience in adult living. The parent mentions that the son says the money makes him feel owned, which could indicate some resentment or past issues. The parent's reaction of yelling might be seen as harsh, especially if the kids are under stress or dealing with their own situations.\n\nBut is the parent wrong to ask for help? In many households, contributing to chores is a given even when financial support is provided. It's about shared responsibility. The parent isn't asking for a lot, just basic help. The children's lack of contribution could be seen as taking advantage, especially considering the parent's sacrifices. However, the parent's method of expressing frustration (yelling) might be problematic. But the core issue is whether the expectation is fair.\n\nThe son's comment about feeling owned is a red flag. It suggests that the parent's approach might be triggering negative feelings. The parent should probably consider why the son feels that way and address that, rather than just demanding help. However, that doesn't mean the parent is wrong to expect some chores. Maybe the parent's approach could be more collaborative, but the expectation itself is reasonable.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expecting help, but their reaction could have been handled better. The core issue is the expectation of chores in exchange for financial support, which is common. The son's resistance and the parent's yelling complicate things, but the parent's initial request is reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
