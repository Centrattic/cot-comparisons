On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is at fault for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they're being financially supported. The parent provides a house, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun things. The kids are both adults, one in college, the other starting a job soon. Both moved back home in the past year. The parent works long hours, and the kids don't have jobs yet. The parent feels they're doing a lot and expects some help with chores, but the kids aren't stepping up. The parent got angry when the son didn't do the dishes and mentioned the money given as a way to make the parent feel like they own him.\n\nFirst, the parent has every right to expect some help in exchange for the support they're providing. It's reasonable to ask for basic chores, especially when they're working hard and the kids are living at home. The parent isn't a clean freak just wants a lived-in home. The kids, even though one is in college, are in a position where they can contribute. The son's response about the parent feeling ownership is a bit manipulative. The parent isn't trying to own them, just wants mutual respect and shared responsibilities. The parent's frustration is valid because they're doing a lot and the kids aren't pulling their weight. The fact that the kids received money for outings but didn't help after that is a point where the parent felt it's unfair. So, the parent isn't in the wrong here. They're setting boundaries and expecting fairness.\n"
