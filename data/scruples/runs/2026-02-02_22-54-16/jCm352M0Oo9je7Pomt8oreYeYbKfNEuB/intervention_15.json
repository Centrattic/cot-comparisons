On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help with household chores in exchange for the financial support they're providing. \n\nFirst, the author has two adult children who moved back home. They pay for the house, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun things. The kids aren't working yet (one is in college, the other starting soon). The parents work over 50 hours each week. The author has asked them to help around the house, and while they did some things, the author feels they're not contributing enough. The son's response about the dresser and the cousin outing led to an argument where the author expressed frustration.\n\nI need to consider if the author's expectations are reasonable. Adult children, even if living at home, often are expected to contribute to household chores. The author isn't a clean freak, just wants basic help. The financial support is substantial, so expecting some reciprocal help might be justified. However, the author did yell, which could be seen as a poor way to handle the situation. The son's comment about the author feeling ownership is a red flag; maybe the author's tone or approach made it feel like an obligation rather than a mutual agreement.\n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The expectation of help for support isn't inherently wrong. However, the method of communication (yelling) might be problematic. However, the user's question is about the expectation itself, not the yelling. Since the author is asking if they're in the wrong for having the expectation, the answer likely leans towards No (B). The parents are working long hours and providing significant support; expecting some help is reasonable. The son's response about feeling owned is an issue, but the author isn't in the wrong for seeking help.\n"
