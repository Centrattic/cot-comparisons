On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help with chores since they pay for things. The situation is that both kids moved back home, aren't working yet (though one is starting soon), and the parents work long hours. The author feels it's fair to ask for help around the house, but the kids aren't doing much. The son even accused the parent of trying to \"own\" him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The kids are adults and moved back in, so the parent is providing financial support including housing, utilities, food, and even money for fun. The parent is working a lot and the kids aren't contributing. The son's response about the parent paying for things so they can feel like they own him is a red flag. That seems like a defensive or manipulative response. \n\nNow, the parent is asking if they're at fault for expecting help. The parent isn't a clean freak, just wants basic chores. The kids are getting a lot of support but aren't working yet. One is in college, the other starting a job. Maybe the parent's expectations are reasonable. But maybe they should have set clearer boundaries from the start. However, the parent did ask for help and the kids didn't comply. The parent's frustration is understandable. The son's accusation is toxic. Parents shouldn't feel they have to pay for everything without any contribution. So the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to ask for help. Answer B.\n"
