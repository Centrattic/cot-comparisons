On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they're paying for various expenses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents have adult children (21 and 20 years old) who moved back home. The parents are covering housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun activities. Both kids don't have jobs yet, one is in college, the other starting soon. The parents work long hours. The mother feels the kids aren't helping with chores and got upset when the son didn't prioritize her request over his own task. The son seems to have a defensive attitude, implying the money makes the parents feel like they own him.\n\nThe question is whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting help in exchange for financial support. \n\nFrom a typical societal perspective, it's common for parents to expect some level of responsibility from adult children, especially when they're living under the same roof and receiving financial support. The parent is not a clean freak, just wants a functional living environment. The kids are not contributing, which can be frustrating. The parent's anger seems reasonable given the circumstances. However, the parent might need to set clearer boundaries or communicate expectations better. But in terms of being in the wrong, the parent isn't necessarily wrong to want help. The son's attitude is problematic, but the parent's request is valid.\n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The parent is justified in expecting some help in exchange for the support they provide. The kids are adults, and contributing to household chores is a basic expectation in many families.\n"
