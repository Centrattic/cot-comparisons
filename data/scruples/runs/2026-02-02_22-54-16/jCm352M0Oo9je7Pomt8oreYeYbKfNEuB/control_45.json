      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they're being supported financially. The situation is that both kids moved back home, aren't working (one is in college, the other starting a job soon), and the parents work a lot. The mom gets angry when the son doesn't do the dishes, mentioning that she pays for things and they should be grateful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural norms around parental expectations. In many places, especially in Western cultures, it's common for parents to expect some help from adult children who are living at home and receiving financial support. The parents argue that they're paying for housing, utilities, food, and other expenses, so the kids should contribute to household chores. The kids, however, don't seem to feel the same way. The son's response about the parents paying to \"own him\" suggests resentment or a feeling of being controlled.\n\nThe key points here are: Are the parents overstepping by expecting help? Do the kids have a responsibility to contribute? The parents are providing significant financial support, which can create an imbalance. However, maintaining a shared household often requires some level of cooperation. The author's frustration is understandable, especially after working long hours and managing their own stress. The son's behavior of not doing the dishes when asked might be seen as disrespectful or inconsiderate, especially given the context of the parents' financial contributions.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might be expecting a level of gratitude that isn't there. The daughter and son aren't working, which could affect their motivation to help around the house. The son's comment about the parents paying to \"own him\" indicates a possible power struggle. The parents might be projecting their expectations onto the children without considering the kids' perspectives or the dynamics of their relationship.\n\nIt's also important to consider communication styles. The mom yells and brings up past expenses, which might not be the most effective way to address the issue. Arguing about money and chores in an emotional tone can escalate conflicts. Maybe a calmer, more structured approach to setting household expectations would be better.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The parents are entitled to expect some level of help, especially since they're providing for the children's basic needs. However, the way they're addressing it, and the underlying tension about financial control, might be contributing to the problem. The children, being adults, should have some autonomy and responsibility, but they also need to respect their parents' needs.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expecting help, but their approach might be part of the issue. The answer would likely be B, not in the wrong, but with some caveats about communication and mutual respect.\n"
