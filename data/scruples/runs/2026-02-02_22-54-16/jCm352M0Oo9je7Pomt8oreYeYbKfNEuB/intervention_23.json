On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their adult children, who are living at home and receiving financial support, to help with housework. The parent works long hours, provides housing, utilities, food, and other expenses. The children are in their early 20s; one is going to college, the other is starting a job soon. The parent asked the son to do the dishes, but he was busy with his belongings. The parent got angry and mentioned paying for their outing with the cousin as a reason for expecting help. The son seems to have a negative perception of the parent's financial support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations of adult children living at home. In many cultures, it's reasonable for parents to expect some level of contribution from children who are not employed but are receiving support. The parent is working hard and covering all costs, which is a significant financial burden. The children aren't contributing financially, so contributing with chores makes sense. \n\nHowever, the parent's tone and approach might be an issue. Yelling and bringing up past expenses could come off as harsh or manipulative. The son's reaction suggests that there might be underlying issues with how the financial support is perceived. The parent's frustration is understandable, but the method of addressing it could be counterproductive. \n\nThe key points are: the parent's financial support, the children's responsibilities, and the communication style. While the parent isn't wrong in expecting help, their approach might need adjustment. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance in how the situation is handled. The parent's expectations are reasonable, but the way they expressed them might not be the most effective.\n"
