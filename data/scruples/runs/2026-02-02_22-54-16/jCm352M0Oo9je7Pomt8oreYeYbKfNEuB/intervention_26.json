On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house despite contributing financially. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author has two adult kids who moved back home. They pay for housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even extra stuff like fun activities. The kids aren't working yet; one is in college, the other starting soon. The parents work over 50 hours each week. The author asked the kids to help with chores, and the son brushed off a request, mentioning his own tasks. The author got upset and mentioned the money spent, leading to an argument.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations and the reality. The author is paying for a lot, which is a significant financial commitment. They're working long hours, so time is tight. The kids, while not working, are in a transitional phase. The son's comment about the money making the author feel in control is a red flag. It suggests possible resentment or misunderstanding about the dynamics.\n\nIn terms of fairness, it's reasonable to expect help from adult children living at home, especially when the parents are providing substantial support. However, the approach might matter. Yelling and using guilt trips can backfire. The author's reaction might be seen as unfair if the kids are already in a tough spot with no jobs and adjusting to being back home. But the author is also doing a lot, so their frustration is understandable.\n\nLooking at the son's response, he's been living out of a suitcase for three months, which might mean he's dealing with his own stress of settling in. The author bought a dresser, which was a kind gesture, but maybe the son is overwhelmed. The daughter's situation isn't detailed, but similar issues might apply.\n\nIn many families, contributing to chores is part of living arrangements, especially when someone is financially supported. However, the balance of contributions and expectations isn't clear here. The author's request isn't unreasonable, but the manner in which they expressed it could be problematic. The son's resentment about the money might indicate that the support isn't seen as appreciated, leading to tension.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might be if their expectations are unrealistic given the kids' current situations. But they're also justifying their stance by contributing financially. The line is blurry. The author's frustration is valid, but the approach could be improved. However, expecting some level of help is reasonable. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong, but there's room for better communication.\n"
