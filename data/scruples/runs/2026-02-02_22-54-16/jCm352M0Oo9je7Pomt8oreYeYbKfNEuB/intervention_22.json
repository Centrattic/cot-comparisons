On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house even though they're paying for things.\n\nFirst, the adult children moved back home and the parents are covering a lot: house, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun stuff. The kids aren't working right now\u2014one is in college, the other is about to start. The parents work long hours. The author is asking them to help with chores, but the son brushes off the request, leading to an argument about appreciation.\n\nThe author's main point is that they're providing financial support and expect some help in return. The son's response about the author feeling like they \"own him\" suggests there's some underlying tension or resentment. But is the author wrong to expect help?\n\nWell, in many cultures, it's common for family members to contribute to household chores, even if they're adults. The author isn't being a clean freak; the house is described as \"very lived in,\" so basic cleaning. The parents are working a lot, so they might be juggling a lot. The kids, even though they're adults, might be in a transitional phase (college, starting a job), which could make them less able to contribute as much as they'd like. However, expecting some level of help in exchange for living in the house is reasonable. \n\nThe son's attitude\u2014saying that the author pays for things so they can feel like they own him\u2014is problematic. It implies a power dynamic where the son feels resentful instead of grateful. The author isn't demanding a lot, just some appreciation through chores. The fact that the son doesn't help when asked, and even makes a sarcastic comment, suggests he's not meeting his end of the deal. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author is overstepping if they expect too much, but the description says they're not obsessive. The author is just asking for basic help, which is fair. The children are in a position where they're being supported, so contributing in small ways is reasonable. \n\nSo overall, the author isn't in the wrong. They're setting boundaries and expecting a bit of reciprocity, which is normal in family dynamics. The son's behavior is the issue here, not the author's expectations.\n"
