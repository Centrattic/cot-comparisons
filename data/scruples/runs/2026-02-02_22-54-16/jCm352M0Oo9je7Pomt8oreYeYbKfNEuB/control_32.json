On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.

Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they pay for things. The situation is that both kids moved back home recently, neither has a job (though one is starting soon), and the parents work long hours. The author gave them money for fun stuff, gas, insurance, etc. They asked the kids to help with chores, and when they didn't, the author got upset and yelled about them going out to eat/drink with their cousin last night, expecting appreciation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations of adult children living at home. Typically, when adults live in a household, contributing to chores is considered a shared responsibility, even if they're being supported financially. The parents are providing a home, utilities, food, and other expenses, which is significant. It's reasonable for them to expect some help in return, not necessarily as payment, but as a way to share the household responsibilities.\n\nThe son's response that the author's payments make him feel owned is a red flag. It suggests that the child might be uncomfortable with the dynamic and perhaps the parents' approach to giving money could be contributing to the child's resentment. However, the parents are not wrong in expecting some reciprocation. The key point is whether the author is unreasonable in asking for help, given the circumstances.\n\nThe parents are working long hours and managing a household, so needing help is logical. The children, while not working, are using resources (like the car for gas and insurance), so contributing to chores makes sense. The author's frustration is understandable, especially when the son prioritizes setting up his room over helping with immediate tasks like dishes. Yelling might have been an overreaction, but the underlying expectation isn't unreasonable.\n\nThe fact that the son interprets the financial support as ownership complicates things. The parents might need to address the communication issues, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong to expect help. The children are adults, so it's fair for them to contribute where they can. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries and expecting some level of responsibility from their adult children.\n"
