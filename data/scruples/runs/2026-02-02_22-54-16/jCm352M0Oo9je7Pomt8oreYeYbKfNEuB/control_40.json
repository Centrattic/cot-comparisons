On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help with chores since they pay for their expenses. First, I need to understand the situation. Both adult children moved back home, the parents are covering housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun. The kids don't have jobs (though one is going to college and the other starts a job soon). The parents work over 50 hours each week.\n\nThe author got upset when their son didn't do the dishes, even though he was organizing his new room. The son's response about the author feeling like they own him is a point of conflict. The key here is whether expecting help with chores is unreasonable given the parents' financial support.\n\nI should consider cultural norms and common expectations. Many parents expect some level of contribution from their adult children living at home, especially with financial support. However, the son's comment about feeling owned might indicate resentment. The parents are asking for appreciation through chores, which is a reasonable expectation. The son's lack of help and the dismissive attitude could justify the parents' frustration. Also, the amount of work the parents do (50+ hours each) might make their request more understandable. The answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
