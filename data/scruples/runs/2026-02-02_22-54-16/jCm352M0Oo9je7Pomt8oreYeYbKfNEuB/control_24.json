On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about adult children moving back home and the parent feeling they should help around the house since the parent is paying for various things. \n\nFirst, the parent is paying for the house, utilities, food, and even fun activities, gas, and insurance. Both kids are adults, one in college, the other about to start a job. The parent works a lot and is asking for help with chores. They mentioned they're not a clean freak, just a lived-in home. \n\nThe son didn't do the dishes and instead focused on his own task. The parent got upset and mentioned the money spent on their cousin's outing, and the son's response about the parent wanting to feel ownership. \n\nSo, the parent's argument is that they provide financial support and thus expect some help. The kids, on the other hand, might feel entitled or see the support as a given without needing to reciprocate. The parent is asking if they're at fault for expecting help. \n\nI think the parent is not in the wrong. They're providing significant support and it's reasonable to expect some level of contribution, especially in a shared living situation. However, the way the parent reacted (yelling, implying ownership) might have been harsh. The key is whether the request for help is reasonable. Since the parent is already covering a lot, expecting chores in return is fair. The son's attitude might be the problem here. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
