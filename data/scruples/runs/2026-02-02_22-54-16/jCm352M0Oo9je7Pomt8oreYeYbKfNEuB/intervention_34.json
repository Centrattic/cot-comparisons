On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user posted a question about whether the author is in the wrong for asking their adult children to help with chores in exchange for financial support. The author provides a detailed situation where they pay for their kids' expenses, including housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun activities. The kids don't have jobs, though one is in college and the other starting a job soon. The parent feels they're working long hours and expects some help around the house. When the son didn't comply with a request to do dishes, the parent got angry and accused the kids of not showing appreciation, especially since they used money the parent provided to take their cousin out.\n\nI need to determine if the parent is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants to know what I think. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the parent is providing financial support, which is a significant responsibility. Adult children living at home might reasonably be expected to contribute to household chores, regardless of the financial arrangement. The parent isn't a clean freak, just wants a lived-in home. The son's response about the parent feeling like they own him might indicate a possible control issue, but the parent's request is about chores, not control. \n\nHowever, the parent did yell and bring up the money spent on the cousin outing, which might be seen as guilt-tripping. That could be seen as manipulative. But the core question is whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting help. Since the children are adults, it's reasonable to expect them to pitch in. The parent isn't asking for a lot, just basic help. The argument that the parent is in the wrong would focus on the emotional manipulation, while the other side says it's fair to expect help when you're supporting them.\n\nI think the parent isn't in the wrong because they're asking for reasonable contributions from adults who are being financially supported. The yelling might be a problem, but the underlying request is valid. So answer B.\n"
