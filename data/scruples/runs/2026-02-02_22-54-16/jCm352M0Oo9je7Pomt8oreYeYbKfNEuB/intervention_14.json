On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house in exchange for financial support. \n\nFirst, the author has two adult children who moved back in after the pandemic. They're both in their early 20s, with one in college and the other starting a job soon. The parents are working over 50 hours a week each and are providing housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and extra money for fun things. The kids aren't working yet, but one is in school.\n\nThe main issue is the author getting upset when the kids don't help with chores. The son, in particular, didn't do the dishes and instead focused on organizing his new dresser. The author feels they're paying for everything and expects some appreciation in the form of helping out. The son's response about the author paying to \"own him\" is pretty aggressive.\n\nI need to consider expectations. The author isn't a clean freak; they just want the kids to contribute. The kids are adults, so there's an expectation of responsibility. But they're still in a transitional period, possibly adjusting after moving back in. The parent's frustration is understandable given the workload and financial burden. \n\nThe son's attitude is problematic. Saying that the parent pays to control him is a deflection and shows a lack of respect. The author's response, while emotional (yelling), is a reaction to perceived ingratitude. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't wrong to expect some level of help when they're providing so much. It's reasonable for parents to ask for basic chores, especially when they're working long hours. However, the approach might need adjustment\u2014maybe setting clearer expectations from the start. \n\nThe kids, being adults, should contribute to household responsibilities as a matter of respect and shared living. The author's position is reasonable, and the son's reaction is unwarranted. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
