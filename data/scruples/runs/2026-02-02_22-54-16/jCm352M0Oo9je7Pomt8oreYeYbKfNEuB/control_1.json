On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house in exchange for financial support.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The adult children (21 and 20) moved back home. The parents are covering rent, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even giving money for fun activities. The parents work over 50 hours each week. The kids aren't working yet, one is in college, the other starts soon. The author asked them to help with chores, and when they didn't, the author got angry and mentioned the money spent on their cousin's outing. The son seems to have a defensive attitude, accusing the parent of trying to \"own him.\"\n\nI need to consider if expecting help is unreasonable. Since the kids are adults, even though they're living at home and being supported, it's common for parents to expect some level of contribution, especially with chores. However, the parents are providing a lot financially, so there might be an expectation of gratitude or help in return. \n\nBut the son's response about feeling owned is problematic. That suggests a possible power dynamic or past issues. The author's outburst might have been a reaction to perceived ingratitude. But is the author wrong to expect help? It's a balancing act. The parents are working long hours and taking care of multiple responsibilities. It's reasonable to ask for help with household tasks, especially when everyone lives in the same home. \n\nHowever, the way the author expressed their frustration\u2014yelling and bringing up past expenses\u2014might have been harsh. The son's defensive attitude could be contributing to the tension. So while the author's expectation isn't inherently wrong, their reaction might be. But the core question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking for help in exchange for financial support. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong for expecting help. Parents often provide for their adult children, and contributing to household chores is a reasonable expectation. The son's response and the author's reaction are both issues, but the author's initial request isn't wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
