On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for expecting their adult children to help with chores after they cover expenses. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author has two adult children who moved back home. They pay for the house, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun activities. The kids don't have jobs right now, one is in college and the other is starting soon. The parents work over 50 hours each week. The author has asked the kids to help around the house, and they did a bit. The author isn't a clean freak, just a lived-in home.\n\nThen, there's an incident where the son refuses to do the dishes to set up his new dresser. The author gets upset and yells about them going out with their cousin last night, implying they should be grateful and help out. The son claims the parent is paying to feel like they own him.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nI need to consider societal norms and expectations. Adult children, even when living at home, are expected to contribute, especially when the parents are working a lot and covering most expenses. However, the author's approach might be too harsh. Yelling and accusing the son of being controlled could be counterproductive. The son is in a transitional phase (just moved in, starting college soon) which might affect his willingness or ability to help. Also, the son's comment about feeling owned suggests there's underlying tension. The author's reasoning is valid in expecting some responsibility, but the method\u2014yelling and public shaming about a social outing\u2014might be the real issue here. So the author isn't entirely wrong in expecting help, but their reaction could have been better. However, the question is just about being \"in the wrong.\" Since the core request (help with chores for financial support) is reasonable, the answer is B.\n"
