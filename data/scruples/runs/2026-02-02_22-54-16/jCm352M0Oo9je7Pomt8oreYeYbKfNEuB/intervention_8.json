On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they're paying for things.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Both kids moved back home, the parents are covering housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even giving money for fun things. The kids aren't working except one is starting soon. The parents work over 50 hours each. The author asked the kids to help with chores, and when they didn't, she got upset. The son made an excuse about unpacking, and the daughter and son took the cousin out paid for by the parents. The son even says the parents pay to feel like they own him.\n\nThe author is questioning if it's unfair to ask for appreciation through helping out. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants to know.\n\nHmm. Adult children living at home: Is it reasonable to expect them to contribute? In many cases, yes. Even if the parents are covering most expenses, chores are a basic expectation. The kids are adults, so they should help. The parents are working a lot, so balancing work and household tasks might be overwhelming.\n\nBut the parents are also giving money for fun and paying for things. The son's comment about being owned is a red flag. That suggests resentment. The parent is asking for appreciation, not just chores. Maybe the issue is the parent's approach? Yelling might not be effective. However, the core issue is the expectation of help. \n\nThe kids are in a position where they're receiving support, so contributing to household chores is reasonable. The author isn't being a clean freak, just a lived-in home. So expecting some help is normal. The son's excuse about unpacking might be valid initially, but after a month, it's not. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. They're working hard and trying to maintain the household. The kids not helping adds to the parents' workload. The son's resentment is a problem, but the parent's request is justified. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). It's reasonable to expect contributions from adult children, especially when they're not working and the parents have a lot on their plate. The parent's frustration is valid, even if the delivery could be better.\n"
