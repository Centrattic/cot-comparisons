On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is at fault for expecting their adult children to help with chores since they pay for things. The situation is that both kids moved back in, neither has a job yet (one in college, the other starting soon), and the parents work long hours. The author asks for help around the house, but the kids don't comply, leading to frustration.\n\nFirst, the parents are providing a lot: housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun. That's a significant financial commitment. The key point here is that the author is asking for reasonable help in return. It's common for parents to expect some level of contribution when they're covering major expenses, especially with adult children who are capable of helping.\n\nThe author mentions they're not a clean freak and the house is \"very lived in,\" so their expectations aren't excessive. The son's response about moving into a new dresser and taking time to settle in might be valid, but if the parent is asking for small tasks like dishes, there's an expectation of mutual respect and shared responsibility. The son's comment about the parent paying to \"own\" him is problematic and disrespectful, which justifies the parent's frustration.\n\nThe author's outburst about the previous outing where they paid for the kids to take their cousin out is a bit of a red flag. Using guilt or past expenses to demand help might not be the healthiest approach, but the core issue is about fairness in household responsibilities. The parents are overworked and need help, and the kids aren't contributing despite being able to do so. \n\nConsidering all this, the parents aren't in the wrong for asking for help. They've provided a lot and are within their rights to expect some assistance. The children's lack of cooperation and dismissive attitude is the main issue here. So the answer should be B.\n"
