On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house since they pay for things. The situation involves two adult kids who moved back home, aren't working (except one is starting soon), and the parents work long hours. The author gave money for fun things, gas, insurance, and even bought a dresser. When asked to help with chores, the kids didn't comply, and the author got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many cultures, parents expect children to contribute to household chores, especially when they're living at home and not working. The author isn't a clean freak, just wants a lived-in home. The kids aren't doing much, and the author is working hard. It's reasonable to expect some help in exchange for the support provided. \n\nThen there's the dynamic of money. The son's comment about the author paying to feel ownership is a red flag. It suggests there might be underlying issues or resentment, but the author's request for help isn't unreasonable. The parent is providing financial and emotional support, so expecting some reciprocity makes sense.\n\nAlso, the kids are adults, so they should understand the value of contributing. The parent isn't forcing them but is asking, and when they don't comply, expressing frustration is natural. The key points are the parent's contributions and the kids' lack of help despite being asked. \n\nI think the author is justified in their request. The answer should be B.\n"
