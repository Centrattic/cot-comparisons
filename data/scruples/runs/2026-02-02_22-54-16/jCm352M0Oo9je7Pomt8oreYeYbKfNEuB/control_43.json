But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the parent is paying for their adult children to live at home, including utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun stuff. The kids moved back in the past year. One is in college, the other starting a job soon. The parents work over 50 hours each week. The parent asked the kids to help with chores, and they did a bit. The parent isn't a clean freak, just a lived-in home.\n\nThe son was asked to do dishes, but he was busy setting up his new dresser. The parent got angry and yelled, mentioning that the kids had spent money on their cousin the night before. The son claims the parent gives money so they feel like they own him. The parent is asking if they're at fault for expecting help around the house in exchange for their support.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The parent is providing significant financial support for their adult children. It's reasonable to expect some level of contribution in return, especially with the amount of support given. The kids are adults, so they have responsibilities. The parent isn't asking for anything unreasonable, just cleaning up. However, the parent's reaction was to yell and bring up the previous spending, which the son perceives as controlling. The son's comment suggests he feels pressured or manipulated by the parent's financial support.\n\nOn one hand, the parent isn't unreasonable in expecting help. On the other, their approach might be contributing to the tension. The key here is whether the parent's expectations are fair and how they communicated them. The parent might not be wrong for expecting help, but their method of enforcing it could be part of the problem. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. If the parent is asking for basic chores in exchange for room and board, that's standard. The issue is more about the son's attitude and the parent's reaction. Since the parent isn't a clean freak and the kids are supposed to be helping, maybe the parent isn't in the wrong. The son's response might be the problem. So, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. But wait, maybe the parent is overstepping by linking financial support to chores and implying ownership. The son's comment about feeling owned is a red flag. Maybe the parent is using guilt or financial leverage inappropriately. That could mean the parent is in the wrong. It's a bit of a toss-up. The parent has a right to expect help, but if they're making it about feeling ownership, that's a problem. The parent's approach might be contributing to the son's resentment. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're using financial support as leverage to get chores done, which could be manipulative. But I'm not sure. The parent is providing for the kids, so expecting some help is reasonable. The line is crossed if they're making it about feeling ownership. The parent's anger and yelling might not be justified. The son is an adult; maybe the parent should let him handle it as an adult. Maybe the parent is being too controlling. Hmm. I think the answer is B (No), because the parent is within their rights to expect help, but the way they're handling it is part of the issue. But the question is if the parent is in the wrong. If the parent is asking for help, that's not wrong. The son's response is the problem. So the answer is B.\n"
