On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house, given that they pay for various things. Let's break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author has two adult kids, 21 and 20, living at home. They're paying for the house, utilities, food, plus fun stuff, gas, and insurance. One is in college, the other starting a job soon. The parents work over 50 hours each week. The author wants help with chores, like dishes, but the son resents it, saying the money makes the author feel in control. The author got angry and mentioned the recent expense for their cousin's outing.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the expectations of adult children who are living at home and receiving support. In many cultures, adults are expected to contribute to household chores, especially if they're in the home. The parents are providing financial support, but they also have their own demanding jobs. The son's comment about the money being a way to \"own\" him seems to imply he feels it's a transactional relationship. But is that a valid perception?\n\nThe daughter and son aren't working now, but one is in college and the other is starting a job soon. Maybe they have other responsibilities, but chores are still a part of sharing the household. The author isn't a clean freak and the house is \"very lived in,\" so the expectation isn't unreasonable. The son's attitude might be the issue here\u2014maybe he's being ungrateful or not taking responsibility. The parents are giving a lot, so expecting some reciprocation in chores is fair. \n\nBut wait, the son is living out of a suitcase for 3 months. Maybe he's in the process of settling in, and the dresser was a new purchase. If he's just moving in, maybe he's overwhelmed. However, the author says they did do a couple things before, so they were contributing somewhat. The recent incident with the dishes and the argument about money seems like a conflict over appreciation and responsibility. \n\nThe parents' position is that they're providing for the kids, so some help around the house is reasonable. The kids might feel that since the parents are paying, they don't need to contribute. But adult children, even if they're not working, should help with chores because it's a shared living space. The son's comment about the money being a way to own him is a bit extreme. The author is asking for appreciation through actions, not a clean house. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to expect some help. The kids, especially the son, might be in the wrong for not contributing and for the hostile attitude. The answer should be B (No).\n"
