On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves two adult children moving back in, the parents paying for their expenses, and the parent feeling that the kids should help with chores as a form of appreciation.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The parent provides a home, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun activities. The children aren't working, one is in college, the other starting a job soon. The parent works long hours and is trying to get help with chores. The son responds by saying the parent's payments make him feel owned. The parent yells about not showing appreciation after paying for their cousin's outing.\n\nNow, considering societal norms, when children are adults and living at home, especially when the parents are providing significant financial support, it's reasonable to expect some level of contribution, especially with chores. The parent isn't being a clean freak; the house is just lived in. The parent is asking for basic help, which the kids are doing minimally. \n\nThe son's response that the parent's payments make him feel owned is concerning. It suggests a possible control issue or resentment on the son's part. The parent is just trying to get help, not demanding perfection. The parent's frustration is understandable given the workload and expenses. \n\nHowever, the parent did yell and made a comment about the cousin outing. Yelling might not be the best approach, but the core request for help isn't unreasonable. The children aren't working and are receiving support, so contributing to household tasks is fair. The son's attitude seems more problematic here. \n\nIn most cultural contexts, contributing to household chores is expected when living at home, regardless of age, especially when parents are the primary financial supporters. The parent isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and expecting some form of contribution. The children's lack of help and the son's hostile reaction are more indicative of the issue being on their side. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
