On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help with household chores since they pay for things. The kids are 21 and 20, both moved back home. The parents are working long hours and providing for them, including money for fun stuff, gas, insurance. The son and daughter are in college or about to start. The parents asked the kids to clean, and when they didn't, the author got angry and mentioned the money they spent on the cousin outing. The son accused the author of trying to own him through payments.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong in expecting help in exchange for financial support. Let's break it down. The parents are providing significant financial support, which is a big deal. Adult children are expected to contribute to household chores as a general societal norm. However, the son's response about the author trying to own him seems a bit extreme. The parents are not forcing them, just asking for help. The kids might feel they are entitled to some freedom since they're adults, but moving back home often comes with expectations of contribution. The author's frustration is understandable given their workload. On the other hand, yelling might not be the best approach. But the core issue is whether expecting help is reasonable. Since they are living in the same home and the parents are paying for multiple things, it's fair to ask for some help. The author isn't in the wrong for setting expectations. So the answer is B.\n"
