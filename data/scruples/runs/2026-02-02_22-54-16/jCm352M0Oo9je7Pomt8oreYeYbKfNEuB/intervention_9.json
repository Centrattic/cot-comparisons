On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house in exchange for financial support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The parents are paying for their adult kids' housing, utilities, food, entertainment, gas, and insurance. The kids moved back home recently, one is in college, the other about to start. The parents work over 50 hours a week. They've asked the kids to help with chores, and when they didn't do enough, the author got upset and yelled, mentioning the money spent on their cousin's outings.\n\nThe author's argument is that since they're paying for everything, the kids should contribute with chores as a form of appreciation. The kids, however, seem to feel that the financial support is a form of control. The son's response about the dresser and moving out of a suitcase might indicate he's in a transitional phase, perhaps adjusting to being back home.\n\nI need to think about societal norms. Many people expect adult children living at home to help with chores, especially if the parents are covering living expenses. However, some might argue that after a certain age, independence is expected, and pushing for chores could be seen as parental control. But given the parents' workload, it's reasonable for them to seek some help.\n\nThe author's outburst might be seen as harsh, but the context includes long hours and financial responsibility. The kids not having jobs yet might not be their fault, but still, contributing to chores is a basic expectation in many families. The son's comment about the author feeling ownership is a red flag, suggesting possible resentment, but that's the son's perspective.\n\nOverall, the author is not in the wrong for expecting appreciation through helping with chores. The key is that they're not being asked to pay rent but to contribute in a way that's fair given the parents' sacrifices. The answer should be B (No).\n"
