On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they pay for everything. The kids are adults, both moved back home, and the parent is covering housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun. The kids aren't working yet\u2014son is in college, daughter starts soon. The parent works a lot.\n\nThe parent's frustration is that they're paying a lot and expecting help around the house. The son's response was that he's setting up his room, and he even accused the parent of wanting to \"own him\" when money is mentioned. The parent got angry and yelled about the kids spending money on their cousin last night and expecting appreciation.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the parent is paying for everything and wants help, which seems reasonable. The kids are adults, so they should contribute. But the parent might be overstepping if they're not clear on expectations from the start. However, given that the parent is covering all the costs, it's fair to expect some household responsibilities. The son's attitude and response might be problematic, but the parent's reaction (yelling) could be seen as harsh if the expectations weren't set early. However, considering the parent's situation, it's understandable they're frustrated. The answer is probably B, the parent isn't in the wrong. They have a right to expect help when they're covering all expenses. The kids, being adults, should contribute regardless. The parent's reaction might be a bit much, but the underlying expectation is reasonable.\n"
