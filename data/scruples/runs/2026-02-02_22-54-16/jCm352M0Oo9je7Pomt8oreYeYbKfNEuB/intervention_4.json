On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they're paying for everything. The kids are 21 and 20, both moved back home in the past year. The parent is covering housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even fun money. The kids aren't working (though one is starting soon and the other is in college). The parent asks them to help with chores, but the son responds with excuses and the parent gets upset, even yelling about the kids taking the cousin out last night. The son also accuses the parent of using money to control him.\n\nFirst, the parent's main issue is that they're paying for a lot and want the kids to help out. From a general perspective, it's reasonable for parents to expect some level of contribution, especially if the kids are living at home and benefiting from the household. However, the kids are adults, so this might be a matter of setting boundaries and mutual respect.\n\nThe parent mentions that they're not a clean freak and the house is just lived in, so maybe their expectations aren't unreasonable. The son's response about feeling owned is a red flag. It sounds like there's some resentment or communication issues here. The parent's reaction to the son's excuse could be seen as harsh, especially if the parent is already stressed from working long hours.\n\nThe key points here are: the parent is providing financial support, the kids are adults, and the parent is asking for help around the house. The parent's tone and the son's defensive reply might be contributing to the tension. But expecting some help in exchange for financial support isn't wrong. However, the way the parent expressed frustration and yelled might be an issue. It's possible the parent needs to approach this with more communication and perhaps set clearer expectations rather than yelling.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting help, but the method of communication might be problematic. The son's attitude and the parent's reaction could both be areas for improvement. But based on the question whether the author is in the wrong, the core issue is the expectation of help in exchange for financial support. Since the parent is providing for the kids and the kids are adults, the parent's stance is understandable. The answer might lean towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but there's a nuance in how the situation is handled.\n"
