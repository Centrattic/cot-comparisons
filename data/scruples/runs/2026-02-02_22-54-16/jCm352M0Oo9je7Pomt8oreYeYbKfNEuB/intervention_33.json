On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user provided a situation where the parent is asking if they're at fault for expecting their adult children to help around the house since they pay for various expenses. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The adult children are both in their early 20s, moved back home, and neither has a job yet (though one is starting soon and the other is in college). The parents work over 50 hours a week and are covering all the living expenses, including food, utilities, gas, insurance, and even money for fun activities. The parent feels they're doing a lot and expects some help with chores, but the children aren't contributing as much as they'd like. \n\nThe parent mentioned that they're not a clean freak and the house is \"very lived in,\" so it's not about excessive cleanliness. They asked their son to do dishes, but he prioritized setting up his new dresser instead. The parent then got angry and brought up the fact that they paid for his and his sister's outing with a cousin from another state. The son's response was that the parent gives money so they can feel like they own him, which is a defensive reaction.\n\nNow, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. From a typical societal perspective, it's reasonable for parents to expect their adult children to contribute to household chores, especially if they're living at home and receiving financial support. The parent is not demanding perfection but some appreciation through helping out. The children, being adults, should have some responsibility. However, the children might feel they're being taken advantage of, especially if they're not working or if the chores are seen as a form of control. \n\nThe parent's frustration is understandable. They're working long hours and providing for the kids while expecting some reciprocity. The son's comment about feeling owned is problematic, indicating a strained relationship. But does the parent have a right to expect help? In many cases, parents do expect some level of contribution, and the parent's reaction might be justified given the circumstances. However, the way the parent reacted\u2014getting angry and yelling\u2014could be seen as over the top, but the underlying expectation isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the children being adults. At 21 and 20, they're adults, so it's reasonable to set boundaries and expect help. The parent isn't asking for much, just basic chores. The children's lack of help, despite the parent's sacrifices, might be the real issue here. The parent is not in the wrong for wanting appreciation and help, but perhaps the approach could be more constructive. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the parent isn't wrong to ask for help when they're providing financial support. The children might be in the wrong for not contributing, but the parent's stance is valid. So the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
