On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house since they provide financial support. The adult children are 21 and 20, both moved back home within the past year. The parents pay for housing, utilities, food, plus give money for fun things, gas, and insurance. Neither child has a job yet, though one is going to college and the other starts a job soon. The parents work over 50 hours each week.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations of help and the financial contributions. The author is asking if it's wrong to expect help in return. The son's response about the author trying to \"own\" him is a red flag, indicating possible resentment. The author got upset when the son didn't help with the dishes after having a social outing paid for.\n\nFirst, it's reasonable for parents to expect some level of contribution from their adult children, especially when they're sharing a household. However, the parents are providing significant financial support. The children are still in transition\u2014college and starting a job\u2014so their ability to contribute might be limited. But they're adults, so some responsibility is reasonable.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. They're working long hours and covering many expenses. Expecting help with chores to maintain the household is normal. However, the way the author expressed their frustration\u2014yelling and bringing up the money spent\u2014might not be constructive. It's possible the son feels pressured or that the parents are using financial support as a form of control, which could lead to tension.\n\nThe son's comment about the author trying to own him suggests underlying issues, maybe related to control or the dynamic of the relationship. It's important for the parents to communicate expectations clearly and set boundaries without using guilt or financial leverage. The daughter might have similar feelings but isn't mentioned here.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't necessarily wrong to ask for help. But the approach might need adjustment. Instead of focusing on what they've paid for, emphasizing shared responsibilities in maintaining the home could be more effective. Also, considering the children's current life stages and their limited ability to contribute financially, expecting some chores is reasonable, but the method of communication is key.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but with the caveat that their approach could be improved to foster a more positive environment.\n"
