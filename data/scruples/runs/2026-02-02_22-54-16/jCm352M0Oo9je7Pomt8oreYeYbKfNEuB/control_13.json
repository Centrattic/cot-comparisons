On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house since they're paying for their expenses. The children are 21 and 20, both moved back home, no jobs (though one is starting soon and the other is in college). The parents work long hours.\n\nSo, the author expects help with chores, like doing dishes. When they asked, the son made an excuse about organizing his new dresser. The author then yelled, mentioning paying for their fun activities. The son responded by implying that the author's money makes him feel owned.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if it's reasonable to expect adult children to contribute to household chores. It's common for parents to expect help, especially when they're supporting them financially. The author isn't a clean freak, so the request isn't excessive. The children are adults, so they should have some responsibility.\n\nThe son's response about feeling owned is a red flag. It suggests he's not taking the author's perspective and might be resentful. However, the author's frustration is understandable given the workload and expenses. Yelling might not be the best approach, but the expectation itself isn't unreasonable.\n\nThe daughter is in college, which might affect her availability, and the son is starting a job soon. Their current situation could be a transition period. The author's request for appreciation through chores is a way to balance the financial support with some responsibility.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asking for a fair share of help. The problem might be in how the request was communicated (yelling), but the expectation itself is valid. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
