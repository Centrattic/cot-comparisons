On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.

Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help with house chores since they pay for things.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The parents have two adult children, both moved back home. The parents cover the house, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun stuff. Neither has a job, though one is in college and the other is starting soon. The parents work over 50 hours each week. They asked the kids to help around the house, which they did a bit. The son didn't do the dishes when asked, and the mom got angry, mentioning that they had paid for their cousin's outing. The son feels the money is making him feel owned.\n\nSo, the key points here: Are the parents wrong to expect help? Well, they're providing financial support, which is significant. But adult children might have responsibilities of their own. However, in a shared household, contributing to chores is reasonable. The parents are working long hours, so expecting some help is fair. The son's response about feeling owned suggests a possible issue with how the support is perceived. The mom's frustration is understandable given the effort they're putting in. \n\nBut the kids are adults. They might need to take initiative. The mom's approach of yelling could be problematic, but her expectation is not unreasonable. The son's attitude that money equates to ownership is a red flag. The parents aren't in the wrong for asking for help. The question is about whether they're wrong for the request, not the method. So the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
