We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about Valentine's Day plans.\n\nSo the author, Moja, has been dating Jeremy for a month. She's met him 2-3 times a week but admits it's not a \"fireworks at first sight\" relationship. She's considering it to maybe develop into something more. When Jeremy asked about her Valentine's plans, she told him she'd prefer to work because it's good money and she's not into the holiday. Then later, he calls her after drinking, tells her she's acting like an asshole, and mentions the elaborate plans he made. She was clear before he spent the time and money, right? \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. Moja was upfront that she didn't care for V-Day and wanted to work. Jeremy, after two weeks, still didn't get the hint and went ahead with plans. She's saving for a trip, which is a valid reason. He got upset because she wasn't excited about his gestures, but those are his preferences. She's not opposed to romantic things, just this specific holiday. \n\nJeremy's reaction seems a bit over the top. If he wanted a romantic partner, maybe he should have known her stance better. Moja didn't lie or change her mind after he made plans. She was consistent. The fact that he hung up and criticized her might indicate he didn't handle the situation well. \n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong, and I agree. She communicated her preference clearly. Jeremy's response was inconsiderate. So the answer should be B.\n"
