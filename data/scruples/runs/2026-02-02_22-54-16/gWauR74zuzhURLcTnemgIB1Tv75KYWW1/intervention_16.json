We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a dating relationship where the author, Moja, declined Valentine's Day plans with her partner Jeremy, even after he put a lot of effort into planning a romantic evening. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the situation. They've been dating for about a month, meeting 2-3 times a week. The author doesn't feel a strong spark yet but likes him and is open to a future. On Valentine's Day, when asked, she told him she prefers to work because it's good money and she's not into the holiday. Later, Jeremy, after drinking, calls to reconsider, revealing he made elaborate plans. Moja stands by her decision, leading to a conflict where he accuses her of being an asshole, and the author is now unsure if she's at fault.\n\nThe main issue here is whether Moja was wrong to stick to her plans despite Jeremy's efforts. Let's break it down. Communication is key in relationships. Moja was clear from the start that she didn't want to celebrate Valentine's Day and preferred to work. She even provided a reason (good money and her personal disinterest in the holiday). Jeremy, however, made plans anyway, possibly not respecting her boundaries. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both parties should respect each other's preferences. If Moja communicated her stance, and Jeremy proceeded to plan without considering her input, the fault might lie more with him. It's also worth noting the relationship's stage; after a month, it's reasonable to expect some mutual understanding of each other's priorities. Jeremy's reaction\u2014especially getting drunk and aggressive\u2014suggests he might be overreacting, which could indicate his own issues rather than Moja's wrongdoing. \n\nHowever, some might argue that Moja could have been more considerate of Jeremy's feelings, given his effort. But she had already expressed her preference, so changing her mind later might not be necessary. The fact that Jeremy didn't check in with her before making the plans shows a lack of communication on his part. \n\nAdditionally, the author's explanation of her reasons (saving for a trip) is a valid personal reason. The key here is that she was upfront. If Jeremy couldn't respect that, maybe they aren't a good match. The user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, which aligns with the analysis. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
