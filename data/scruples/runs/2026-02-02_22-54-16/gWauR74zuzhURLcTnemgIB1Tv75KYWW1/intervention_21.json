We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about Valentine's Day plans. The author, Moja, had a guy named Jeremy who planned an elaborate date, but she had already told him she didn't care for Valentine's Day and preferred to work. Later, when he calls her drunk and upset, she stands by her decision, and he gets angry.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. Moja was clear about her feelings towards Valentine's Day right from the start. She mentioned it wasn't a holiday she cared about and that she preferred working because it's good money. She had seen Jeremy a few times a week over a month, so there's some history. Jeremy, on the other hand, planned all these things without checking if she was on board, even after she had already stated her preference.\n\nThe main issue here is communication. Moja made her stance clear when he first asked about her plans. Jeremy then went ahead and planned something elaborate without considering her response. When she reiterates her choice, he gets upset, which seems like his own problem. \n\nNow, is Moja in the wrong? Well, she was upfront. People have different views on holidays and how they want to spend them. If someone plans something after being told the other person isn't interested, it's on them for not respecting that boundary. Moja also mentions they aren't even at the point where they're kissing, so the relationship isn't super serious. She's also saving money for a trip, which is a valid reason. \n\nJeremy's reaction, especially after she was clear, seems unreasonable. His getting drunk and calling her an asshole is uncool. Moja's side of the story is that she's not into the holiday and prefers to work. She's not making a big deal out of it, just sticking to her choice. \n\nI think the answer is B, she's not in the wrong. Jeremy should have respected her initial statement. It's his responsibility to understand her preferences and not push when she's already said no. Plus, making plans after being told she's working is on him. The user's own thought was that the author isn't wrong, which aligns with this reasoning.\n"
