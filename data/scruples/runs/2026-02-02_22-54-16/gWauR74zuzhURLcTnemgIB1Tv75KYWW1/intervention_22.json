We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about Valentine's Day plans. The author, let's call her \"Moja,\" is dating Jeremy for a month. They've seen each other a few times a week. She mentioned she doesn't really care for Valentine's Day and prefers to work because it's a good money day. Jeremy calls her after drinking, gets upset, says she's an asshole, and they argue. Now Moja is torn about whether she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if Moja was wrong. Let's break down the key points. She was upfront about not caring for Valentine's Day and that she'd rather work. She told him this when he asked about her plans on Sunday. Then he called her at 8pm drunk, tried to get her to reconsider, and when she didn't, he made a big deal about his plans. She explained she was saving money for a trip and that he didn't get the hint. Now he's texting her with a half-apology.\n\nMoja's main argument is that she was clear about her plans. She didn't agree to do anything with him on Valentine's Day initially, and she had a legitimate reason (work) to not do anything. Jeremy, on the other hand, proceeded to make elaborate plans without checking if she was still interested. That seems like his mistake. She's not obligated to participate in a holiday she doesn't care about. Also, she's saving money for her trip, which is a personal goal. \n\nJeremy's reaction was over the top. He got drunk, called her an asshole, and hung up. That's not healthy behavior in a relationship, especially in the early stages. Moja was honest about her preferences, and Jeremy didn't respect her boundaries by making plans without her consent. \n\nSo, considering all that, Moja isn't in the wrong. She communicated her preferences, and Jeremy overstepped by making plans without considering her input. The problem here is more on Jeremy's side for not respecting her initial refusal and then reacting poorly. The answer should be B (No).\n"
