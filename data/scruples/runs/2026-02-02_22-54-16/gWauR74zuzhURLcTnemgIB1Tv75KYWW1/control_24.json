We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about Valentine's Day plans. The author, Moja, told Jeremy upfront that she doesn't care for Valentine's Day and would rather work because it's good money. Jeremy then plans an elaborate date, but she ends up working anyway.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. They've been dating a month, seen each other 2-3 times a week. Not a \"fireworks\" relationship yet, but maybe potential. Moja is clear about not celebrating Valentine's Day, so Jeremy's plans might have been unexpected. \n\nShe was clear when he first asked about her plans. He then spends time and money planning something romantic. But when she sticks to her original decision to work, he gets upset, calls her an asshole, and hangs up. Now she's wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nKey points: She was upfront about not wanting to celebrate. Jeremy made plans without considering her stance. Moja has her own priorities (saving money for a trip). Jeremy overreacted. \n\nIs she wrong for not changing her plans after being clear? Probably not. She communicated her intentions. Jeremy should have respected that. His reaction was inappropriate. The fact that he made plans after she said no shows maybe he didn't take her seriously. \n\nHer explanation about saving money adds context. She's not just avoiding him but has a specific reason. The user might argue that people should be flexible, but if you're clear about your plans, it's not your fault if the other person doesn't take it seriously.\n\nSo answer B (author not in the wrong). She was clear, he overreacted. She's not obligated to change her plans based on his efforts after she said no.\n"
