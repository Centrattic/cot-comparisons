We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves Jeremy planning a romantic Valentine's Day date, but the author (let's call her Moja) had already told him she didn't want to celebrate and preferred to work. Then, after he made elaborate plans, she changed her mind a bit but ultimately stuck to her original decision.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. Moja was clear about her preferences when Jeremy first asked. She mentioned she doesn't care for Valentine's Day and would rather work because it's good money. Then, after some time, Jeremy calls her when he's drunk, and she's busy. She reiterates her plans, and he gets upset, even hanging up. Later, he sends a non-apology. She's torn between feeling bad and thinking it's not her fault because she was clear from the start.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether it's reasonable for Moja to have changed her plans after Jeremy made these plans. But wait, she did tell him upfront. Jeremy might have thought that maybe she was just being modest or that there was a chance she might change her mind. However, she was explicit about not wanting to celebrate and her preference to work. \n\nAnother angle is the communication. Jeremy made plans after two weeks of dating, which some might see as moving a bit fast, but if he believed there was a chance she might go, then making reservations is a risk. But Moja had already communicated her stance. So, is he at fault for planning without confirming again, or is she at fault for not being clearer?\n\nAlso, the drunk call complicates things. He might have been emotional and overreacted, but she had already told him twice. She might feel she's not responsible for his expectations. The fact that she's saving money for a trip adds context\u2014her priorities are clear. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, if there's no spark yet, maybe she's still in the \"getting to know you\" phase. It's possible that Jeremy wanted to take it to a more romantic level, but she's not there yet. She's honest about her preferences, which is good. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. She communicated her plans clearly, and while Jeremy was disappointed, the responsibility isn't entirely on her. The answer should be B.\n"
