  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling a guy I've been dating for about a month that I'd rather work on Valentine's Day than hang out with him, even after finding out his elaborate and romantic plan?\nI met \"Jeremy\" about a month ago on Tinder. We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about Valentine's Day plans. The user, let's call her Moja, is dating Jeremy for about a month. They've seen each other 2-3 times a week. She's not feeling a strong spark yet but is open to the possibility. \n\nOn Sunday, Jeremy takes her to a hockey game (her favorite sport). After, he asks about her Valentine's Day plans, and she tells him she doesn't care for the holiday and would rather work because it's good for money. They aren't even at the kissing stage yet.\n\nThen, a few days later, Jeremy calls her drunk and asks if she'll reconsider. She says she's already scheduled to work. He tells her he planned a romantic dinner, carriage ride, and rose petal bath. She explains she's clear and that she's saving money for a trip. He calls her an asshole and says the relationship has two parts. He then hangs up. She feels bad, but also thinks it's his fault for planning elaborate stuff for a two-week-old relationship.\n\nSo, the question is: Is Moja in the wrong? \n\nFirst, looking at communication. She was clear from the start that she didn't want to do Valentine's Day. When she was asked by Jeremy, she directly said she preferred to work. That seems honest. Then, Jeremy didn't take that as a final answer and went ahead to make plans. When she declined again, he got upset and acted out. \n\nBut maybe Jeremy felt ignored or that his efforts were wasted. But in a one-month relationship, expecting someone to drop work for a romantic gesture might be unreasonable. Moja is also clear about her priorities (work and saving money) and her preferences (no holiday, more casual activities). \n\nJeremy's reaction was harsh, calling her an asshole. He might have overstepped, but he did put in effort. However, Moja didn't hide her stance. She was clear, so Jeremy might have misread the signals. \n\nConsidering that Moja was upfront, and Jeremy made plans after knowing her initial refusal, it seems that Jeremy might be the one in the wrong. She's not obligated to change her plans based on his efforts, especially when she's already communicated her preferences. \n\nSo, the answer is B (Not the asshole). She was honest and he overreacted.\n"
