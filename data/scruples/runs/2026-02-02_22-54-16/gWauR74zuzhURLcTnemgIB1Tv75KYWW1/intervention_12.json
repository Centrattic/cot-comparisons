We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a one-month relationship where the author, Moja, told her partner Jeremy that she doesn't want to celebrate Valentine's Day and would rather work. Jeremy then got upset, even after she was clear about her preference. He made a big deal about his romantic plans and even called her an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. They've been dating for a month, which is not very long. Moja was upfront when Jeremy asked about her Valentine's plans, saying she doesn't care for the holiday and prefers working. Jeremy then called her an asshole and hung up after she explained she's saving for a trip. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. Moja was clear from the start about her stance on Valentine's Day. Jeremy, on the other hand, made elaborate plans without considering her expressed preference. Even after she reiterated her decision, he reacted poorly. \n\nIn relationships, especially in the early stages, it's important to respect each other's boundaries. Moja didn't pressure him to plan anything; he did so on his own. Her response was honest and respectful. Jeremy's reaction seems more about his own investment in the plans than Moja's choice. \n\nAlso, the fact that they haven't even reached the \"kiss goodbye\" stage suggests the relationship isn't very serious yet. Expecting her to change her plans after being clear might be unreasonable. \n\nThe author's main question is whether she's the asshole. From the details, she wasn't in the wrong for sticking to her decision after being clear. Jeremy's overreaction and not respecting her boundaries indicate the issue is on his side. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
