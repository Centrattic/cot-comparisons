We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" story is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author, let's call her Moja, has been dating Jeremy for about a month. They see each other 2-3 times a week. She doesn't feel a strong spark yet but likes him. On a recent date, he asked about her Valentine's Day plans. She told him she doesn't care for the holiday and would rather work because it's good money. Later, he calls her drunk, and gets upset because he had planned a romantic dinner, carriage ride, and bath. She had already told him she wanted to work, but he seems to think she should have considered his effort. He accuses her of being an asshole, and they argue. She feels conflicted now because maybe she should have given him a chance despite her initial refusal.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if Moja did something wrong. She was clear about her preferences. Valentine's Day isn't important to her, and she had already communicated that. She had a valid reason (money for her trip) and her priorities. Jeremy made plans without considering her stated preferences, maybe expecting her to change her mind. \n\nBut wait, they were in a month-long relationship. Jeremy's effort might seem thoughtful, but if she had already said no, maybe he should have respected that. The problem here is communication. She was clear, but he went ahead with plans assuming she might change her mind. Also, getting drunk and then calling her a bad name (asshole) is on him. \n\nMoja's actions: She told him upfront she'd rather work. When he asked again later, she reiterated her reasons. She's not obligated to attend a romantic dinner he planned if she didn't express interest. Jeremy's issue seems to be that he wanted her to change her plans, but she had her reasons. \n\nIs she in the wrong for not bending even after he made plans? I don't think so. She was clear, and if he didn't consider that, the fault is his. However, maybe she could have been more considerate in her refusal. But she did express her reasons. \n\nAlso, he hung up on her, and his behavior was aggressive. She's not at fault for standing by her decision. The key points are communication and mutual respect. If she respected his plans, but he didn't respect her decision to work. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
