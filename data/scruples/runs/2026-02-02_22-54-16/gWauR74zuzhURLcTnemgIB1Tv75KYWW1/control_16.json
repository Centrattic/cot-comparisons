We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a dating situation where the author, let's call her Moja, is being asked by her partner Jeremy to spend Valentine's Day together. Jeremy had an elaborate plan, but Moja had already told him she doesn't care for Valentine's and prefers to work. She later received a call from Jeremy, who was drunk and upset, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. Moja was upfront with Jeremy about her preferences regarding Valentine's Day. She had told him directly that she wasn't interested in celebrating and would be working instead. Jeremy, however, went ahead and planned a romantic evening. When Moja confirmed her plans again, Jeremy reacted negatively, even calling her an asshole. Moja feels like she's in the right because she communicated her intentions clearly, while Jeremy seems to have misread the situation or had higher expectations.\n\nNow, considering communication. In relationships, clear communication is key. Moja did communicate her preferences early on. It's important to note that they've only been dating a month, so maybe Jeremy hoped for a more serious commitment, but Moja hasn't indicated that. Jeremy's reaction might stem from unmet expectations or misreading the level of commitment. However, Moja has the right to set her own boundaries. She's not obligated to engage in romantic gestures she's not interested in, especially if she's clear about it. \n\nJeremy's response, especially being drunk and aggressive, is problematic. He should have respected her decision. The fact that she's saving money for a trip adds context to her prioritization. Also, the fact that they haven't had physical intimacy yet might mean the relationship is still in an early stage where such expectations can be misaligned.\n\nSo, from Moja's perspective, she was clear, and Jeremy didn't accept her boundaries. She's not obligated to change her plans if she's communicated them. Jeremy's over-the-top reaction and not respecting her wishes are his faults. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not the Asshole). The author isn't in the wrong because she communicated her preferences and followed through, while Jeremy didn't respect that.\n"
