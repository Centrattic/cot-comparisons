We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a dating relationship where the author, let's call her Moja, told her partner Jeremy that she'd rather work on Valentine's Day instead of spending time with him, even after he made elaborate plans. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. They've been dating a month, met a few times a week. The author isn't into Valentine's Day and made that clear when he asked about her plans. She was working that day. Then Jeremy, after a call where he was drunk, planned a romantic dinner, carriage ride, etc., even though they haven't been intimate yet. She declined again, saying she was clear before, and he got upset, called her an asshole.\n\nNow, the question is whether Moja is in the wrong. Let's break down the arguments. On one side, she was upfront about not wanting to do Valentine's Day and her preference to work. She's saving money for a trip, which is a valid reason. She's not opposed to romantic gestures but prefers different activities. She had already declined when he asked about her plans. Jeremy might have overstepped by making elaborate plans without confirming her interest, especially in a relatively new relationship. \n\nOn the other side, maybe she should have considered Jeremy's feelings more. He put effort into planning, and she rejected it after he had already arranged things. But she had already communicated her stance before he made the plans. So, maybe he didn't take her initial refusal as a clear sign and overcommitted. \n\nThe user might think that once you've made plans, you should honor them, but she had already said no before he made the plans. So she's not at fault for sticking to her initial decision. Jeremy's reaction seems extreme. He got drunk and called her an asshole, which is his fault. \n\nAlso, the author is clear about her preferences. It's important in a relationship to respect each other's boundaries. She wasn't hiding her schedule or her dislike for Valentine's Day. Jeremy should have respected that and not made plans he knew she might not want to do. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong. She communicated clearly, and Jeremy overreacted. His planning after being told she doesn't like the holiday was his mistake.\n"
