  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling a guy I've been dating for about a month that I'd rather work on Valentine's Day than hang out with him, even after finding out his elaborate and romantic plan?\nI met \"Jeremy\" about a month ago on Tinder. We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me read through the details carefully.\n\nSo, the user is dating someone named Jeremy for a month. They've seen each other a few times a week, but it's not a super intense relationship. Jeremy planned a romantic Valentine's Day, but the user told him upfront they don't care for the holiday and would rather work. Then, when Jeremy called drunk and made a big deal about his plans, the user clarified their stance again, mentioned they're saving for a trip, and Jeremy got upset and hung up. The user is confused if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, the user was clear about not wanting to celebrate Valentine's Day. They told Jeremy upfront that they prefer working on that day. So, they weren't hiding their preferences. Jeremy, on the other hand, went ahead and made elaborate plans without considering that maybe the user wasn't interested in a romantic gesture. The user is into hockey and hot wings, not rose petals and dinners. \n\nThe user also mentions they're saving money for a trip, which maybe Jeremy didn't know. But the user didn't have to share that unless they chose to. The problem here is that Jeremy might have misread the relationship's status. A month into dating, planning a big romantic gesture might be premature if the user hasn't shown interest in such things. However, the user was clear from the start about their disinterest in Valentine's Day. \n\nBut the user's issue is that they didn't communicate their summer trip plans yet. That might have been a point where Jeremy felt hurt because he put in effort, and the user didn't share their own plans. But the user's main responsibility is to their own preferences. \n\nThe user stood by their decision even when Jeremy got upset. The user's actions seem reasonable because they communicated their intent. Jeremy's reaction was over-the-top, especially calling them an asshole and hanging up. The user isn't obligated to change their plans just because Jeremy put in effort, especially if they were clear. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. They communicated their preferences, and Jeremy's reaction was inappropriate. The user's stance is valid because they don't have to conform to a romantic holiday if they don't want to. Jeremy might have misread the relationship's seriousness, but the user isn't wrong for sticking to their word.\n"
