We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a dating scenario where the author, let's call them \"Moja,\" told her boyfriend Jeremy that she'd rather work on Valentine's Day than hang out with him, even after finding out he had planned a romantic evening. Jeremy then got upset, called her an asshole, and hung up.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. Moja and Jeremy have been dating for about a month, meeting 2-3 times a week. She mentions there's no \"fireworks\" but she likes him, and there's a possibility of more. So it's not a super intense or long-term relationship yet. \n\nOn Sunday, Jeremy took her to a hockey game, which she likes. Then he asked about her Valentine's Day plans, and she directly told him she doesn't care for the holiday and prefers to work. She's clear from the start. Then later, he calls her, drunk, and asks again. She reiterates she's working. He then reveals his elaborate plans\u2014dinner at a nice restaurant, a carriage ride, and a rose petal bath. She points out that she works at a place that has a Michelin star, implying maybe his restaurant isn't as nice. She explains her preference for hockey and hot wings over his romantic setting. He gets angry, calls her an asshole, and hangs up. The next day, he sends a non-apology, making her feel bad.\n\nSo the question is, did Moja do something wrong here? Let's analyze both sides. \n\nFrom her perspective, she was clear about her plans when he first asked. She's not into Valentine's Day and prioritizes work. She's saving money for a trip, which gives a reason for her choice. Jeremy, on the other hand, made a big plan without confirming if she was still interested. He might have thought she was open to changing her plans after seeing his effort. But the fact that she was clear initially matters. \n\nJeremy's reaction seems over-the-top. Getting drunk, calling her in the evening, and then getting angry after she said no again. His plans might be sweet, but expecting her to drop her plans (especially when she had already communicated her preference) could be seen as insensitive. Also, the fact that they're not even at a point where they've kissed yet (as per the original post) suggests the relationship isn't that serious yet. Making such a big romantic gesture for someone you've been dating a month might be excessive, and expecting her to drop work isn't fair.\n\nMoja's response was to stay true to her stated plans and explain her reasons. She didn't change her mind despite his efforts. That's her right. Jeremy's frustration and anger come from not accepting her boundaries. The key here is communication. She was clear, and he still pursued plans that she had already declined. The problem might be his inability to accept her decision without getting upset, rather than her being in the wrong for sticking to her word.\n\nAlso, considering the timeline: she told him she'd rather work when he first asked. Then, after he made the plans, she again said she's working. He didn't confirm with her again, assuming maybe she'd change her mind. That's on him. She's not obligated to change her plans just because he put effort into something she had no interest in.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author (Moja) is not in the wrong. She communicated her preferences clearly, and Jeremy overstepped by making plans without checking again and then reacting poorly. The answer should be B.\n"
