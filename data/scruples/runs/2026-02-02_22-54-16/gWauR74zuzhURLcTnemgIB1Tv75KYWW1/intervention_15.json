We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The scenario is about Valentine's Day plans.\n\nSo, the main points are: The author (Moja) is dating Jeremy for a month. They've seen each other 2-3 times a week, but there's not much spark yet. On Sunday, Jeremy asked about V-Day plans, and she said she'd rather work. Then a week later, he called drunk and tried to get her to change her mind, even though she was clear about working. He made elaborate plans (dinner, carriage ride, bath) which she points out are for a relationship that's only two weeks into. After a heated argument, he hung up. She's torn between feeling bad and thinking he overreacted.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. I need to decide if she's the asshole (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, communication. She was clear from the start that she doesn't care for V-Day and would rather work. That's her right. People have different priorities. Jeremy didn't get the hint. Maybe he thought they were more serious than they were. She's been with him a month, not super long. He made plans without checking if her plans changed. But she didn't mention her Eurail trip until the call. That might have been a factor in her not wanting to go. \n\nHe got drunk and yelled at her. That's not cool. She was upfront, and he overreacted. She's not obligated to say yes to his plans just because he put effort in. Especially since she's in a work-related phase. She's not the one backing out after agreeing; she was clear from the beginning. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe she should have considered his feelings more. But he should have respected her initial refusal. The fact that he made plans without ensuring her availability shows maybe he didn't take her no seriously. She's not in the wrong for sticking to her decision. So answer B.\n"
