We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (Moja) is in the wrong for declining Jeremy's Valentine's Day plans despite him putting in a lot of effort. \n\nFirst, Moja had already told Jeremy upfront that she didn't want to celebrate Valentine's and would work instead. She was clear about her preferences. Jeremy, on the other hand, went ahead and made these elaborate plans without checking in again, which seems like a miscommunication or maybe unrealistic expectations. \n\nMoja mentions they've been dating about a month, and the relationship isn't super intense. She's not into the whole romantic gestures yet, and she's focused on her goals like saving for a trip. It's important to consider communication here. If she was clear before and Jeremy didn't adjust, maybe he's the one not on the same page. \n\nBut wait, Jeremy did call her after she said no, and got upset. That could indicate he didn't handle the rejection well. His reaction of calling her an asshole and hanging up isn't great. Moja stood by her decision, which is her right. \n\nAlso, the fact that they haven't even kissed yet might mean the relationship isn't at a point where such elaborate plans are expected. Jeremy's actions might be premature. Moja's honesty about her preferences is respectful, and she's not obliging him to change her plans. \n\nThe key points are clear communication from her side and Jeremy's overreaction. So, I think the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
