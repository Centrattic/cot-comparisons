We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about Valentine's Day plans and a disagreement between the author and her date, Jeremy.\n\nFirst, the author has been dating Jeremy for a month. They've seen each other a few times a week, but there's no strong spark yet. She likes him, maybe seeing a future, but it's not super serious. On Sunday, he asked about her Valentine's Day plans, and she told him she's working and doesn't care for the holiday. She's clear about her preferences. Then Jeremy calls her drunk the next week, trying to get her to change her mind about working. He's upset she didn't accept his elaborate plans. She explains she was clear before and mentions her Eurail trip. He gets angry and hangs up. The next day, he sends a half-apology, making her feel bad, but she's conflicted whether she's wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she's not, but wants my opinion. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author was clear from the start. She told Jeremy she prefers working on Valentine's Day and doesn't prioritize the holiday. She's consistent in her communication. Jeremy, however, made a big effort for a plan that the author didn't really indicate was necessary. Since the relationship isn't super serious yet, maybe he overstepped by creating such an elaborate plan without knowing if she's into that. His reaction\u2014getting drunk, calling her an asshole, hanging up\u2014seems immature and disrespectful. The author didn't force him to make those plans; he did it without checking if she's on board. So she's not wrong for sticking to her plan once she's communicated it.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have considered Jeremy's feelings more. She mentions he worked hard on the plans, and maybe she could have been more accommodating. But she was upfront about her preferences, and it's his responsibility to respect that. If he's okay with her not participating in romantic gestures, then his reaction is his issue. The author isn't obligated to change her plans just because someone else expects her to. Also, the fact that he didn't know about her Eurail trip until she brought it up shows he might not be attentive enough to her priorities.\n\nAnother point: The author isn't in a committed relationship yet. They've been dating a month, not exclusive or serious. So maybe Jeremy's expectations were too high. The author isn't wrong for not meeting those expectations if they weren't communicated properly. She's also clear about her work schedule, which is a legitimate reason. Plus, she felt conflicted after his half-apology but is questioning if she's the asshole. Her actions were honest and upfront, and she's saving money for a trip, which is her personal goal. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author communicated her intentions clearly, Jeremy overstepped by making plans without her input, and his reaction was inappropriate. The author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
