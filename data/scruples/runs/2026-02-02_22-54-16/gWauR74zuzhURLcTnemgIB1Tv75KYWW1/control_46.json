We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who's been dating Jeremy for a month, declining his Valentine's Day plans even after he revealed his elaborate romantic plans. The author is torn between whether she was clear enough and if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author met Jeremy on Tinder, they've seen each other 2-3 times a week for a month. She likes him but hasn't felt a strong spark yet. On Sunday, he asked about her Valentine's plans, and she directly said she preferred to work. Later, he called her drunk, revealed his plans, and she stood by her decision. He got upset, called her an asshole, and hung up. Now she's wondering if she's wrong.\n\nThe main issue here is communication and expectations. The author was upfront when he initially asked about her plans. She communicated her preference to work and not celebrate Valentine's. Then, when he later shared his plans, she was consistent with her decision. The problem arises from his reaction and the assumption that she should have known or changed her mind. \n\nIn relationships, even casual ones, honesty is key. The author was clear about her plans. However, making elaborate plans for a two-month-old relationship might be Jeremy's mistake. He may have assumed more commitment than she intended. The author isn't obligated to change her plans if she's been clear. On the other hand, maybe Jeremy should have communicated his feelings about the holiday earlier, but the author's directness seems justified.\n\nThe author is saving money for a trip, which is a valid reason. Jeremy's reaction (calling her an asshole) is immature, which might indicate his own issues rather than her wrongdoing. The fact that they aren't intimate yet and the author hasn't mentioned the trip before might add to the misunderstanding, but the core issue is her right to choose her plans after being clear. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong because she was honest and he overreacted. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
