We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about Valentine's Day plans. The author, who's been dating Jeremy for a month, told him she'd rather work than spend the day with him, even after he made a big romantic plan. Now she's questioning if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. They've been dating for a month, met a couple times a week. The author isn't super into the relationship yet but likes him. When Jeremy asked about Valentine's plans, she was direct that she didn't care for the holiday and preferred to work. Later, Jeremy called drunk, tried to get her to change her mind, and she explained she was clear. He got mad and hung up. Now she's confused because part of her feels bad but also thinks he shouldn't have planned elaborate stuff for a new relationship.\n\nThe author's main points: She was clear upfront, he didn't take the hint, and he made plans without considering her preferences. But maybe she should have been more considerate of his feelings? Or perhaps he overstepped by getting angry? \n\nFrom a communication standpoint, she did express her preference before. Jeremy, on the other hand, might have expected her to be more flexible, but that's his assumption. The author isn't obligated to change her plans just because he made them. Also, he got drunk and called her an asshole, which is his fault. She's not the one who's being unreasonable here. She's honest about her priorities and has her own goals (saving for a trip). \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. Jeremy didn't respect her boundaries and overreacted. The answer should be B.\n"
