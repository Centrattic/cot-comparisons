We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about Valentine's Day plans and a disagreement with their boyfriend, Jeremy. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author and Jeremy have been dating for a month. They've seen each other a few times a week, but it's not a \"love at first sight\" scenario. The author mentions that there's no strong spark yet, but they like each other and maybe there's potential for something more. That's important context because it sets the stage for where each person is in the relationship.\n\nOn Valentine's Day, the author told Jeremy upfront that they don't care for the holiday and prefer to work instead, which is when they make good money. Then Jeremy, after a couple of weeks, calls her drunk and asks if she'd reconsider. She declines again, mentioning her work schedule. He then reveals his elaborate plans, which the author finds surprising and maybe even a bit over the top. The author explains her reasons again, and Jeremy gets upset, even hung up on her. The next day, he sends a non-apology, making the author feel bad, but she's torn between feeling guilty and thinking it's not her fault he made those plans.\n\nNow, the user's take is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they want to know the assistant's opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A for yes, B for no). \n\nLet me consider both sides. The author was clear about her preferences when Jeremy first asked. She didn't lead him on by saying maybe or being unsure. She made her position known: she prefers to work on Valentine's Day. Jeremy, on the other hand, made elaborate plans without considering that she might not want that. The fact that they've only been dating a month and haven't even gotten to the kissing stage suggests the relationship is still in the early stages. It's reasonable for the author to have her own priorities, especially if she's not into grand gestures. Also, the author mentions saving money for a trip, which is a valid reason. \n\nHowever, some might argue that being clear once isn't enough, especially if the other person is really putting effort into planning. But the author did communicate her stance directly. The issue here is that Jeremy didn't pick up on her cues and made plans anyway. The author isn't obligated to participate in a romantic holiday that she doesn't care for, especially if it's not something she's ever shown interest in. \n\nAdditionally, Jeremy's reaction seems disproportionate. The author didn't hide her reasons, yet he accused her of being an asshole. That's a red flag. The author's response was honest and firm, which is appropriate. She's not at fault for not changing her plans after being clear. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. Jeremy misread the situation and made plans without considering her preferences, even after she explained them. The author's actions were respectful and honest. Therefore, the answer should be B for No.\n"
