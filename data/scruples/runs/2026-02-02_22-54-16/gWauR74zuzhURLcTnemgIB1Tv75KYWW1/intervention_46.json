We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario involves a one-month relationship where the author, let's call her Moja, declined Valentine's Day plans after Jeremy made elaborate arrangements.\n\nFirst, Moja was clear from the start that she doesn't care for Valentine's Day and prefers to work because it's well-paying. She mentioned this directly when Jeremy asked about her plans. Then, Jeremy surprised her with a hockey game date, which she liked, but she still made it clear she's not into the holiday. She's also busy and hasn't been very available, seeing him 2-3 times a week. \n\nJeremy then calls her late at night, drunk, and after she explains she's working, he gets upset. He lists the plans he's made, which include a fancy dinner, carriage ride, and bath\u2014things Moja hasn't expressed interest in. He accuses her of being an asshole, which seems harsh. Moja clarifies she's not against those things but prefers to work, and she's saving for a trip. Jeremy then hangs up, and later sends a half-apology.\n\nNow, the key points here: Moja was clear about her preferences early on. She didn't suddenly change her mind. Jeremy made plans without checking if she actually wanted to do them, which might be an issue. He got drunk and confrontational, which isn't healthy. Also, the fact that they haven't even progressed to kissing yet suggests the relationship is still in the early stages. Jeremy's reaction seems to be more about his own feelings of rejection than Moja's actions being wrong.\n\nMoja's side of things is that she communicated her stance on Valentine's Day and her work schedule. She's not avoiding the relationship but is busy. Jeremy's investment in plans that she's not into might be a mismatch. The user's opinion is that she's not in the wrong, and the analysis supports that. Jeremy's behavior\u2014making assumptions, getting drunk, and lashing out\u2014points more to his own issues than Moja's wrongdoing. So, the answer should be B.\n"
