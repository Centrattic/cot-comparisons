We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about Valentine's Day plans and communication between two people dating for a month.\n\nFirst, the author, let's call her AITA, told Jeremy upfront that she doesn't care for Valentine's Day and prefers to work. He then made elaborate plans after learning that. She felt he should have known her preferences by now. He got upset when she didn't change her mind, even calling her an asshole. She's torn because she was clear but maybe should have considered his efforts more.\n\nHmm. So, is she in the wrong? Well, she communicated her plans clearly when he first asked. He went ahead and made plans anyway, which might not be her fault. He had two weeks to prepare after their Sunday meeting. But maybe she should have considered that he might be trying to be romantic and given him a chance to adjust or talk about it earlier. However, she's also consistent in her preferences and has a valid reason (saving money). \n\nHe called her an asshole, which is harsh, and hung up. That's his part. She's not obligated to change her plans if she's already communicated them. The fact that she's still in the relationship shows she's not completely against it, but she's clear about her priorities. \n\nI think the key here is that she was clear with her intentions. He might have overstepped by making plans after she said no. So she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
