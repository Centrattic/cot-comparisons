We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves Valentine's Day plans and a disagreement between her and Jeremy.\n\nFirst, the timeline: They've been dating for a month, meeting 2-3 times a week. The author isn't feeling a strong spark yet but likes him. On Sunday, he takes her to a hockey game, then asks about her Valentine's Day plans. She says she'll be working and doesn't care for the holiday. She thought that was the end of it. \n\nLater, Jeremy calls her drunk, asks her to reconsider, and when she refuses, he gets upset, mentions his elaborate plans, and accuses her of acting like an asshole. The author clarifies her reasons\u2014she's saving for a trip and prefers other activities. Then he hangs up, and she's conflicted about whether she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and expectations. The author was clear from the start that she prefers working on Valentine's and isn't into the holiday. Jeremy, however, made big plans assuming she might change her mind, which she didn't. The user's friend thinks the author is not in the wrong, and I need to agree or disagree.\n\nLet me think about boundaries. She set her boundaries early. He didn't respect them by trying to pressure her after she said no, especially when drunk. Also, his reaction was inappropriate\u2014calling her an asshole and hanging up. The author tried to be polite, explaining her reasons, which shows she wasn't being dismissive. \n\nAnother angle: relationships require mutual understanding. If Jeremy wanted to plan a romantic evening, he should have discussed it with her first instead of making assumptions. She didn't lead him on; she was upfront. His over-the-top reaction suggests he might not be handling rejection well. \n\nThe user's friend's reasoning makes sense. The author isn't at fault here. She communicated her preferences clearly, and Jeremy's actions were his own choice. The author can't be blamed for not changing her plans, especially when she had already stated her intentions. \n\nSo, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
