We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario is about Valentine's Day plans. The author, let's call her Moja, had been dating Jeremy for a month. They've seen each other a few times a week but it's not a super intense relationship yet. She told Jeremy she didn't want to celebrate Valentine's Day and would rather work because it pays well. Then later, he called her drunk and made a big deal about his elaborate plans, which she wasn't aware of, and got upset when she didn't change her mind.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if Moja was clear about her preferences. She mentioned she's not into Valentine's Day and would rather work. She directly told him that when he asked about her plans. So if she was clear from the start, it's his responsibility to not make plans she's not interested in. But then he did go ahead and plan something big. \n\nBut wait, maybe she wasn't clear enough? Or maybe the issue is that he went too far with the plans without checking in again? The fact that they've only been dating a month might matter here. In a new relationship, people might have different expectations. Moja seems to have a more casual approach, enjoying the time together but not into the romance yet. Jeremy, on the other hand, is trying to plan a romantic day, which might be his way of showing commitment or moving things forward. \n\nShe also mentioned that she didn't mention her Eurail trip, which caused another issue. But the main question is about the Valentine's Day plans. She was clear she didn't want to celebrate, so Jeremy's response was disproportionate. She had already stated her preference, so she's not obligated to change her mind. \n\nHe called her an asshole, which is definitely not cool. That kind of reaction is a red flag. She stood by her decision, which is her right. The fact that he made plans after she told him she wasn't interested shows poor communication on his part. \n\nSo, putting this together, Moja was clear about her desires. Jeremy didn't respect her boundaries by making those plans. Even though he might be trying to be romantic, he should have known that she wasn't interested in celebrating. The author isn't in the wrong for sticking to her decision. The issue is more on Jeremy for not respecting her initial statement and overstepping.\n"
