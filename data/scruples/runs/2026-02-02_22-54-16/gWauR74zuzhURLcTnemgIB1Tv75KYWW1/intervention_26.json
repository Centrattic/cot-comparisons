We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for declining to spend Valentine's Day with her boyfriend Jeremy, even after he made elaborate plans.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: They've been dating for a month, met on Tinder, seen each other 2-3 times a week. The author isn't feeling a strong spark yet but enjoys his company. On Valentine's Day, she told him upfront she'd rather work because it's good money. Later, he planned a romantic evening, which she found surprising since they aren't that far into the relationship. She clarified her stance, mentioned her Eurail trip savings, and he got upset, calling her an asshole. She's now torn between feeling bad for not going and thinking he overstepped.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether she was wrong to say no. The AITA (Am I the Asshole?) subreddit usually looks at whether someone overstepped or was unreasonable. In this case, the author was clear about her preference early on. She had the right to prioritize her work and her own preferences, especially if she communicated that. Jeremy's reaction seems excessive, especially after she had already said no. The fact that he made plans after knowing her initial stance could be his mistake. Also, the author hasn't mentioned any prior commitments where she backed out, just stating her preference. Since Valentine's Day is a personal choice, and she's honest about not being into it, she's not in the wrong. Jeremy's planning might have been impulsive given their relationship stage. So, answer B.\n"
