We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (Moja) is the asshole in the situation described. So first, I need to understand the key points of the story.\n\nMoja and Jeremy have been dating for a month, meeting 2-3 times a week. The relationship isn't super passionate but it's okay. Then on Sunday, Jeremy takes her to a hockey game, which is her favorite sport. After that, he asks about her Valentine's Day plans. She tells him she doesn't care for the holiday and would rather work because it's more money. They aren't close enough yet to kiss, so she hugs him and that's the end of the conversation.\n\nThen, Jeremy calls her later in the week when he's drunk. He asks her again about V-Day, she says she's already scheduled to work. He goes on about his elaborate plans, which include a fancy dinner, carriage ride, and a bath with rose petals. They haven't been intimate yet, so that's a bit much. She explains she's saving money for her trip, he gets angry, calls her an asshole, and hangs up. The next day, he sends a non-apology, making her question if she should give him a chance.\n\nNow, the user thinks Moja isn't in the wrong. Let's see why. She was clear about her preferences when asked. She's not into V-Day and prefers working. Jeremy made plans based on his own ideas without considering her preferences, which she had already stated. He then got angry when she didn't change her mind. \n\nBut maybe there's a nuance. Did she have a responsibility to communicate her preferences more clearly? She told him directly she didn't want to celebrate, so she did that. Jeremy's overreaction seems to be his own issue. He might be projecting his expectations onto her. The fact that she's saving money for her trip is a valid reason, and she's consistent in her decision. \n\nHe called her an asshole, which is harsh. His behavior (drunk call, tirade) is problematic. Moja stood by her decision and explained her reasoning. She didn't change her plans after he shared his efforts. That seems fair because she had already made her position clear. \n\nSo, the main issue here is Jeremy's reaction, not Moja's initial refusal. She wasn't obligated to change her plans. The problem lies in Jeremy's inability to handle her clear communication and his own over-the-top reaction. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
