We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about Valentine's Day plans.\n\nSo the author, let's call her Moja, has been dating Jeremy for a month. They've seen each other a few times a week. She's not sure if there's a spark yet but likes him. When Jeremy asked about her Valentine's plans, she told him she'd rather work because it's a good money day for her. Then later, he called her drunk, told her he had elaborate plans (reservation at a nice restaurant, carriage ride, rose bath), and she said she was clear she wanted to work. He got angry, called her an asshole, and hung up. Now she's feeling torn because he apologized text but she's unsure if she's wrong for turning down his plans.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether Moja is in the wrong. The key points are communication and expectations. She told Jeremy upfront she didn't care for Valentine's and preferred to work. He then made plans based on that information. But maybe he thought they were more serious? Or maybe he thought she was being coy and hoped she'd change her mind. But she was clear. He had two weeks to think about it after her initial refusal, but still went ahead with the plans. Then when she stuck to her decision, he got angry. \n\nHer reasons are practical (work money) and personal (not into the holiday). She also mentioned she's saving for a trip. So she's being honest about her priorities. Jeremy's reaction seems out of proportion. He made plans without checking if she was still interested, then got upset when she didn't change her mind. \n\nIn relationships, clear communication is key. She was clear, and he didn't respect her wishes. His reaction was hostile. So Moja isn't in the wrong. The problem is Jeremy's overreaction and not respecting her boundaries. Therefore, answer B.\n"
