We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about Valentine's Day plans. The author, let's call her \"Moja,\" has been dating Jeremy for a month. She told him upfront she doesn't care for Valentine's Day and would rather work because it pays well. Jeremy, after two weeks, planned a romantic dinner, carriage ride, and bath. Then he called her an asshole when she stood by her original plan.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. Moja was clear from the start about her preferences. She didn't hide her schedule or her dislike for the holiday. Jeremy, on the other hand, made elaborate plans despite her earlier statement. Maybe he thought she was being polite, but she was pretty direct. \n\nThen there's the drunk call. He called her after drinking and accused her of being an asshole. That's not respectful behavior. She had already explained her reasons, so his reaction seems over the top. Also, he didn't consider that she had already scheduled work, which is a valid reason. \n\nThe fact that they haven't even kissed yet is another point. The relationship isn't that serious yet, so expecting her to drop work for a romantic evening might be too much. Jeremy's investment in planning a big date might be more about his own needs than considering hers. \n\nMoja's response was staying true to her initial decision. She's saving money for a trip, which is a personal goal. She's not being selfish; she's prioritizing her financial plans. The confusion might be that Jeremy thought there was a spark, but Moja says there isn't yet. So maybe he's projecting more onto the relationship than she is. \n\nThe morning after the call, he sends a non-apology, which adds to the tension. She feels torn because he worked hard, but she's not at fault for not changing her mind after being clear. \n\nIn relationships, especially new ones, respecting each other's boundaries is key. Moja respected Jeremy's initial plan by not committing when he asked about V-Day. He didn't respect her clear communication. So, she's not in the wrong here. His actions were more problematic. \n\nI think the answer is B. She's not the asshole.\n"
