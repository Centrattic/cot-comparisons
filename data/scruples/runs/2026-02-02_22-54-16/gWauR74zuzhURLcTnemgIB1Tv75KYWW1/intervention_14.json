We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a dating situation where the author, who's been dating Jeremy for a month, declines his Valentine's Day plans even after he made elaborate arrangements. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had already communicated their disinterest in Valentine's Day and preferred to work. Jeremy then created a detailed plan, which the author found surprising. The argument arose when Jeremy felt hurt that the author didn't reciprocate the romantic gestures.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, and I need to evaluate that. Communication is crucial here. The author was upfront about their stance on Valentine's Day and work commitments. However, Jeremy proceeded with plans despite the prior communication. The author's refusal isn't about rejecting Jeremy's efforts but about personal preferences.\n\nI should also consider relationship dynamics. A month is early in a relationship, and both parties are figuring out each other's preferences. The author's honesty is important, and Jeremy's reaction might stem from unmet expectations rather than the author's wrongdoing. The author isn't obligated to compromise on their own values or priorities, especially when they were clear from the start.\n\nJeremy's reaction seems a bit over the top, especially after the author had already declined. The author's response was respectful and explained their reasons. The fact that Jeremy hung up and later sent a non-apology might indicate his own issues with handling rejection, not necessarily the author's fault.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author was clear, and Jeremy's plans might have been premature. The author isn't in the wrong for sticking to their decision, especially given their prior communication.\n"
