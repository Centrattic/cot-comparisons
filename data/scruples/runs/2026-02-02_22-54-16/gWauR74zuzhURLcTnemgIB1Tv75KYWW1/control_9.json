We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for rejecting Jeremy's Valentine's Day plans. Let me go through the situation again.\n\nSo, the author, let's call her \"Moja,\" has been dating Jeremy for a month. They've seen each other 2-3 times a week, but there's no \"fireworks at first sight\" moment. She likes him but doesn't feel a strong spark yet. On a recent date, Jeremy asked about her Valentine's plans, and she told him she'd rather work because it's a good money day. She's not a fan of the holiday. Then, later, Jeremy calls her drunk, trying to get her to reconsider. He reveals he had planned a fancy dinner, carriage ride, and rose petal bath. She reiterates her plans, mentions she's saving for a trip, and he gets angry, says she's acting like an asshole, and hangs up. The next day, he sends a half-apology. She's torn about whether she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. Jeremy put in effort for a romantic day, but Moja was clear about her preferences. She told him she wasn't interested in celebrating Valentine's and preferred to work. When he called drunk and tried to change her mind, she stayed consistent. He overreacted, criticized her, and ended the call. \n\nKey points: Communication is crucial. Moja was clear from the start. Jeremy didn't take her no as a final answer and escalated. His reaction was unkind and maybe a bit possessive. She's not obligated to change her plans just because he made them. She's in a position where she's setting boundaries, which is her right. However, maybe there's a nuance where she could have shown more empathy for his feelings, but he overstepped. The user is asking if she's in the wrong. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is important. If she's clear about her preferences and he's not respecting that, the issue is on his side. She's not the one being unreasonable. She's sticking to her values\u2014working on Valentine's because she likes the money and doesn't care for the holiday. His reaction was inappropriate. So the answer is B (she's not in the wrong). However, maybe she could have handled the conversation better, but given the context, she's not the asshole.\n"
