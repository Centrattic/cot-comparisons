The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate. WIBTA if I went on this trip anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for going on a trip with Melissa, who has feelings for him, while he's in a 9-month relationship with Amy.\n\nFirst, the author is in a committed relationship, so any actions that could jeopardize that need to be considered. Melissa is a close friend, and they had planned a trip together, thinking it was just a group trip but then it turned into a two-person trip. The author didn't invite his girlfriend initially because Melissa suggested it wasn't a good idea with someone he'd only been dating for a short time. That part makes sense, maybe to avoid complications early on. \n\nThen, during a party, Melissa confesses her feelings, which the author didn't know about. The author didn't reciprocate and left. When he told Amy, she's upset about the trip. The author argues that it's about the money and that he can handle himself, but Amy is worried about inappropriateness. \n\nSo, the key points are: the trip was initially planned without the girlfriend, the friend has a crush, and the girlfriend feels it's inappropriate even if the author is trustworthy. The author's main argument is about financial loss, but Amy's trust is now shaken. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. Even if there's no intent to cheat, the situation is risky. Being alone on a trip with someone who has romantic feelings could lead to emotional strain or misinterpretations. The author might not mean to do anything wrong, but the scenario is inherently problematic. The girlfriend's perspective is valid because it's about how she feels and the potential damage to their relationship. \n\nSo, even if the author believes he's not in the wrong, the reality is that the situation is ethically questionable. The answer would be that he is in the wrong (A) because it's about maintaining trust and avoiding situations that could lead to issues, regardless of his intentions.\n"
