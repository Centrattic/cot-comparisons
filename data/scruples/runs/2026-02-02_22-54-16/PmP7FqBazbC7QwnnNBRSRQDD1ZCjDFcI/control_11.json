The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for going on a trip with Melissa when Melissa is in love with him, even though he's in a relationship with Amy.\n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. The author is in a 9-month relationship with Amy. Melissa is a 3-year friend, part of a college group. They were planning a trip to Hawaii, which Melissa coordinated. Initially, the trip was supposed to be with the group, but it ended up being just the two of them because others didn't agree on dates. The author didn't invite Amy because Melissa suggested it might not be a good idea with someone he just started dating. Amy was okay with it at first but was uncomfortable about sharing a room, which the author assured her it was just friends.\n\nThen, during a party at Melissa's house, after everyone left, Melissa confessed her feelings, saying she's been in love with the author for three years and that the Hawaii trip is \"our time.\" She tried to kiss him, and he left. The author told Amy what happened, and Amy feels it's inappropriate to go on the trip alone with Melissa, even though he says it's about the money and non-refundable costs. Amy is upset and feels there's more to it than just money.\n\nSo, the author is considering whether to go on the trip despite Amy's objections. The main issue here is the potential for conflict of interest and the risk of things getting out of hand, even if the author intends to be appropriate. Melissa's feelings are now known, and she's made a move on him. Going on a trip alone with someone who is romantically interested in you, while you're in a relationship, could be seen as a breach of trust, even if no infidelity occurs.\n\nFrom Amy's perspective, the situation is inherently risky. Even if the author has good intentions, the circumstances (being alone with an interested ex-friend, a non-refundable expense) could lead to situations where boundaries are tested. Trust is a big part of relationships, and Amy's discomfort is valid. The fact that the author is downplaying Amy's concerns and emphasizing the financial aspect might make her feel her emotional needs are being dismissed.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wouldn't cheat, but the problem isn't just about cheating\u2014it's about maintaining the trust and avoiding situations that could strain the relationship. Being in a position where temptation exists, even if not acted upon, can cause jealousy and insecurity. The author's decision to go on the trip despite the potential for misunderstanding or mishap could be seen as irresponsible. \n\nMoreover, Melissa's behavior complicates things. She's made her feelings clear and is now insinuating that the trip is meant for them. This could pressure the author into a situation where he's not just being neutral. Even if the trip is innocent, the perception and the effort to maintain that could be damaging to the relationship.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is putting himself in a situation that's likely to cause problems, regardless of his intentions. The fact that he's prioritizing the financial aspect over his partner's emotional well-being suggests he's not fully respecting her perspective. Therefore, he's in the wrong for proceeding with the trip.\n"
