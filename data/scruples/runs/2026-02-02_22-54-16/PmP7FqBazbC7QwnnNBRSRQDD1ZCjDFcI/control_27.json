The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate. WIBTA if I went on this trip anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for going on a trip with Melissa, who is in love with him, while he's in a 9-month relationship with Amy.\n\nFirst, the trip was initially supposed to be part of a group of seven college friends, but Melissa couldn't get others to agree. So it became a two-person trip with Melissa. The author didn't invite his girlfriend because Melissa suggested it wouldn't be good to plan a trip so far in advance with a new partner. They had discussed sharing a room, and Amy was okay after being assured they were just friends.\n\nThen, at a party, Melissa made her feelings clear, trying to kiss him. He told Amy about it and there's tension because Amy feels it's inappropriate to go on the trip with her. The author argues it's about money since non-refundable payments were made, and he trusts he can stay appropriate.\n\nNow, considering the relationship dynamics. Being in a committed relationship, going on a solo trip with someone you're friends with who's in love with you can be seen as risky. Even if there's no intention to cheat, the situation could be seen as ethically problematic because it might lead to emotional complications or mistrust. Amy's concern is valid because even if the author is faithful, the trip could strain the relationship. Trust is important, but sometimes avoiding situations that could lead to misunderstandings is also necessary. The author's main argument is about money, but relationships often require sacrificing financial aspects for the sake of trust and emotional well-being. \n\nMelissa's admission of feelings and the past behavior (staying alone, trying to kiss) adds to the potential for a breach of trust. The author might not be cheating, but the act of going on a trip alone with someone who has feelings for you could be seen as crossing a line in the context of a committed relationship. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he's putting his relationship at risk for financial reasons, which is not justifiable. So answer A.\n"
