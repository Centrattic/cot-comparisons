The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate. WIBTA if I went on this trip anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author (the person in the scenario) is in the wrong for going on the trip with Melissa, his friend who is in love with him, while he's in a relationship with Amy.\n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The author has been in a 9-month relationship with Amy. They planned a trip to Hawaii with a college friend group, but due to scheduling issues, it ended up being just him and Melissa. Melissa coordinated the trip, and they had initially shared a room, which Amy was okay with after being assured that Melissa is just a friend. Then, Melissa confessed her feelings, leading to a kiss attempt, and the author told Amy. Amy is now upset about the trip happening without her, even though the author says it's mainly about money and non-refundable costs.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author is in a committed relationship and is planning a trip alone with someone who has a crush on him. Even if the author is confident in their ability to stay appropriate, the situation itself could be seen as risky and potentially hurtful to the girlfriend. The girlfriend's concern is about the appropriateness of the trip, not just the financial aspect. The author might be justifying it by saying it's about money, but the girlfriend doesn't buy that anymore, sensing other motivations.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial, but actions that could be perceived as crossing boundaries can still be problematic. Even if there's no infidelity, the act of being alone on a trip with someone who has romantic feelings could lead to emotional complications. Amy might feel insecure or not respected, even if the author intends to be faithful. The fact that Melissa initiated the romantic feelings after the trip was planned might complicate things further. The author might be in a bind, but the situation is ethically questionable. \n\nSo, considering the potential for harm to the relationship and the girlfriend's valid feelings of insecurity, the author might be in the wrong by proceeding with the trip despite the girlfriend's discomfort. Even if there's no physical infidelity, the emotional aspect and the setup of the situation could be seen as inappropriate. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong), but I need to make sure I didn't miss any nuances. The author's intention is to save money and avoid wasting resources, but in relationships, sometimes the relationship's well-being is prioritized over financial matters. So yes, the author's actions could be seen as wrong.\n"
