The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate. WIBTA if I went on this trip anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complex. The author, let's call him X, is in a 9-month relationship with Amy. He has a friend, Melissa, for 3 years. They planned a trip to Hawaii with their college friends, but due to scheduling issues, it ended up being just X and Melissa. Amy was initially okay with it after being assured they're just friends.\n\nThen, during a party at Melissa's house, she confesses her feelings for X and tries to kiss him. X leaves, but later tells Amy what happened. Amy suggests canceling the trip, but X argues that it's about the money, and he's confident he can stay appropriate. Amy feels hurt because she trusts him but still thinks it's inappropriate. Now, the question is whether X is in the wrong if he goes on the trip.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. First, X is in a committed relationship. Melissa is a friend who has feelings for him. He's going on a trip alone with her after she made a move. Even if he didn't reciprocate, being alone in a romantic setting with someone who has confessed feelings could be seen as a problem. Amy's trust is important, but her being upset shows that this situation might strain their relationship. \n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, even if X is faithful, being in a situation that could be misinterpreted or lead to emotional infidelity is questionable. Melissa's advances might create tension and pressure, making it harder for X to maintain boundaries. Also, Amy's discomfort is valid; being in a situation where the partner is alone with a person who is romantically interested in them can feel violating, even if nothing physically happens.\n\nOn the other hand, X is not breaking any explicit rules. He's not cheating, and he's paying for the trip, which adds a financial angle. He believes he can handle the situation, but his partner doesn't feel comfortable. The key here is mutual respect and communication. Amy feels that the trip is inappropriate, and her feelings matter. If X continues, he might be prioritizing his financial investment over his partner's emotional well-being, which is a red flag.\n\nSo, even though there's no cheating, the situation could be seen as neglecting Amy's feelings and creating a scenario that's risky for both their relationship and Melissa's. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not fully considering his partner's perspective and the potential for harm, even if his intentions are good.\n"
