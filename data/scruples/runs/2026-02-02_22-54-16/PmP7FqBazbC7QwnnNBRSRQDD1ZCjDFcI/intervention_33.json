The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for planning a trip with a friend who has a crush on him, while he's in a relationship. \n\nFirst, the author has a girlfriend named Amy, and they've been together for 9 months. The trip was initially planned as a group thing, but when that fell through, it became a two-person trip with Melissa. The key point here is that Melissa has feelings for the author, and she made that clear during their hangout. The author didn't know about her feelings until then.\n\nNow, the author is considering going on the trip with Melissa despite her confession. His reasoning is that he's already paid for it and doesn't want to waste money. His girlfriend, Amy, is uncomfortable with the idea, even though she trusts him not to cheat. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for proceeding with the trip.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is the appropriateness of a married (or committed) person going on a solo trip with someone who has romantic feelings for them. Even if there's no intention to cheat, being alone in a romantic setting with someone else could be seen as crossing a boundary. It might also cause jealousy or insecurity in the partner, which Amy is showing. \n\nBut then again, the trip was originally planned before Melissa's feelings became apparent. The author didn't know about her feelings at the time. However, now that he knows, it's possible their trip could be misinterpreted, even if they're just friends. \n\nThe author argues that it's about the money and that he can control his actions. But in a relationship, trust and comfort are important. Even if the author is confident, Amy's feelings matter. So, is it the author's fault for not seeing the situation clearly from the start? Or is it his responsibility to now consider his girlfriend's feelings after learning about Melissa's crush?\n\nI think the key here is that the trip was planned before Melissa's feelings were known. However, now that the author is aware, proceeding with the trip could be seen as insensitive to his girlfriend. Even if there's no cheating, the perception and the girlfriend's trust are important factors. The author might not be wrong in a strict sense, but he's not considering how his actions affect Amy's trust and comfort. So, maybe he is in the wrong for not prioritizing her feelings once he knew about Melissa's situation.\n"
