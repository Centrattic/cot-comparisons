The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate. WIBTA if I went on this trip anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for going on a trip with Melissa, his friend who's in love with him, while he's in a 9-month relationship with Amy.\n\nFirst, the key points here: The author and Melissa planned a trip for a group, but it ended up being just the two of them because no one else could agree. The author didn't invite his girlfriend Amy because Melissa thought it wasn't a good idea with someone they'd just started dating. At a party, Melissa made it clear she's in love with him and tried to kiss him. The author left early but told Amy later. Now, Amy is upset because going on a trip alone with Melissa is inappropriate, even if the author says he won't cheat. The author says he's going because of the money, but Amy feels there's something more.\n\nSo, the question is if the author is wrong. From a relationship ethics standpoint, being alone on a trip with someone else who's in love with you can be problematic. Even if there's no cheating involved, it can cause trust issues. The girlfriend's trust is important. The author is prioritizing financial loss over the potential emotional damage to his relationship. That might be a mistake. The girlfriend's perspective is that the situation is inherently risky, not just about money. The author might be underestimating the emotional impact on Amy, even if he's confident about his own actions.\n\nAlso, Melissa's feelings complicate things. If she's made a move on him, going on a trip alone might put him in a vulnerable position, making it hard to maintain boundaries. The fact that Amy is interrogating him suggests she's worried there's more to his insistence than just money. The author might not be considering how his actions affect Amy's feelings and the trust they've built. Even if he's not at fault in terms of cheating, the situation is ethically questionable because it could be seen as disrespectful to his girlfriend's trust and feelings. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because he's dismissing his girlfriend's valid concerns about the appropriateness of the trip and prioritizing his own convenience/money over her emotional well-being. Even if he's not cheating, the situation is a breach of social and relationship norms. Therefore, answer A.\n"
