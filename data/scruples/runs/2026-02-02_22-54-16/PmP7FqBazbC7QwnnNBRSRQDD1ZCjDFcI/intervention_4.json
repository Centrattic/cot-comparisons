The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for going on a trip with Melissa, who's in love with him, while he's in a 9-month relationship with Amy. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and Melissa are friends, and they planned a trip to Hawaii. Melissa initially said others weren't interested, so it's just the two of them. Amy was okay with sharing a room but was assured they were just friends. Then, Melissa made a move, confessed her feelings, tried to kiss him, and he left. Now, Amy thinks it's inappropriate to go on the trip with Melissa, but the author says it's about money and he's not going to cheat.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about infidelity, trust, and what's considered inappropriate. The author claims he's not going to act on the feelings, but the fact that he's going on a trip alone with someone who has feelings for him could be a red flag. Even if he's faithful, being in a situation where temptation could arise might be a problem. \n\nAmy's concern is valid because even if there's no intention to cheat, the scenario itself might be risky. The trip being non-refundable complicates things financially, but relationships often require sacrifice. The author's argument is that trust should be enough, but Amy might feel insecure despite his assurances. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author might be in the wrong because he's choosing financial considerations over his partner's emotional well-being. Even if he doesn't plan to cheat, the act of going on a trip with an ex-crush could make the relationship feel unstable. Also, Melissa's feelings might lead to awkward situations that could strain both relationships. \n\nBut some might argue that if the author is committed to his girlfriend and has no intention of cheating, it's not his fault. However, the situation is ethically murky because he's placing himself in a position where misunderstandings or temptations could occur. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong (A) because he's prioritizing financial loss over his partner's trust and comfort, and it's a risky scenario regardless of his intentions.\n"
