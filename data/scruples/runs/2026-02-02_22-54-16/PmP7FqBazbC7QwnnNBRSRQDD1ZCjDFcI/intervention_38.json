The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate. WIBTA if I went on this trip anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for planning a trip with his girlfriend's friend, Melissa, who is in love with him. The author has a girlfriend, Amy, and they've been together for 9 months. The trip was supposed to be with a group of friends, but it ended up being just the author and Melissa because others couldn't agree on dates. Amy was initially a bit uncomfortable but okay as long as they were just friends.\n\nThen, during a party, Melissa made it clear she's been in love with the author and tried to kiss him. The author told her he wasn't feeling well and left. Now, Amy is upset that the author wants to go on the trip with Melissa despite the situation. He argues it's about the money because some payments are non-refundable. Amy doesn't think it's just about the money anymore and feels the trip is inappropriate.\n\nHmm. The author's perspective is that he's not planning to do anything inappropriate and that he's willing to be appropriate. But Amy doesn't trust the situation. So the question is whether the author is wrong to go on the trip.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, even if the author has no intention of cheating, the situation can be seen as a potential for conflict. Being alone with someone who has feelings for you, especially when you're with a girlfriend, might be problematic. It could lead to jealousy, misunderstandings, or even actions the author didn't anticipate. Even if he's loyal, the perception and the risk of something happening (even if unintentional) might be why Amy is upset.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that he's being accused without cause and that the trip is already planned with financial stakes. However, relationships often require compromise and putting the partner's feelings first. The fact that Amy is feeling the trip is inappropriate and is getting mad suggests that there's a breach in trust or perceived disrespect, even if the author is trying to maintain boundaries.\n\nSo maybe the author is in the wrong because even if he's not intending to do anything wrong, the situation can be seen as creating unnecessary risk and possibly hurting his girlfriend's feelings. The right decision might be to cancel the trip to avoid any potential issues, even if it's costly, to show consideration for Amy's feelings.\n"
