The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nAlright, the author is in a relationship with Amy for 9 months. They have a friend, Melissa, who's been a friend for 3 years. They planned a trip to Hawaii with the college friend group, but Melissa ended up coordinating it and decided it would be just the two of them. Amy was uncomfortable with sharing a room but okay after being assured they're just friends. Then, during a party, Melissa makes a move, saying she's in love with him and that the trip is \"our time,\" which he didn't know about. He tells Amy what happened, and she's upset that the trip is going to happen. The author argues it's about the money and that he wouldn't cheat, but Amy is distrustful.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong to go on the trip anyway?\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The trip was originally planned with the friend group but ended up being just the two of them. The author didn't know Melissa had feelings for him and she made a move. Now, the author is trying to justify going on the trip because of financial reasons and trust. But Amy feels it's inappropriate despite trusting him. \n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, when you're in a committed relationship, the expectations are usually that you avoid situations that could be perceived as risky or that your partner finds uncomfortable. Even if the author feels he's trustworthy, the issue here is more about Amy's feelings and the potential for things to escalate, even if unintentionally. \n\nMelissa's behavior was definitely crossing a line by making advances, and the author didn't know about her feelings beforehand. However, the trip is now a source of tension. The author is choosing to go on the trip despite knowing it upsets Amy. The key point here is whether the trip is inherently wrong or if it's about the author's intentions. \n\nThe author argues that the trip is about money and that he can be appropriate. But in relationships, sometimes partners expect you to prioritize their feelings over logistical issues. The fact that Amy is getting to the point where she's not sure if it's just about money anymore suggests there's deeper trust issues. \n\nSo, even if the author isn't planning to do anything wrong, the act of going on a trip alone with a friend who has feelings for him, especially after that friend made a move, might be seen as inconsiderate or potentially risky. The partner's trust is important, and not respecting her comfort level could be seen as the author being in the wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't initiate the trip alone; Melissa was the one who coordinated it that way. But since the author agreed to it, he shares some responsibility. Maybe he should have reconsidered the arrangement after Melissa's advances. However, the question is whether going on the trip now is wrong. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author didn't intend harm, the situation is problematic because it disregards Amy's feelings and could lead to further issues. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by proceeding with the trip despite the partner's concerns.\n"
