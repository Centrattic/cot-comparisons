The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate. WIBTA if I went on this trip anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is in a relationship with Amy for 9 months and has a friend Melissa who's been in love with him for 3 years. They planned a trip with the college friend group, but due to scheduling issues, it ended up being just the author and Melissa. Amy is upset about the trip, even though the author assures her they're just friends. Then, Melissa confesses her feelings and tries to kiss him. He leaves, tells Amy, and they argue about canceling the trip.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether it's wrong for the author to go on the trip with Melissa despite her feelings. The author says it's just about the money and that he can be appropriate. Amy doesn't trust the situation, even if she trusts him not to cheat. \n\nHmm. The user's opinion is that the author isn't wrong. But I need to evaluate based on the facts. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the trip was planned before Melissa's confession. The author didn't know about her feelings before, so he didn't intend to go on a trip that could be problematic. Then, after the confession, he informs Amy. The trip is already paid for with non-refundable costs, so canceling would be a financial loss. The author argues that he can handle the trip appropriately, but Amy is concerned about the potential for impropriety. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for going? Well, even if he doesn't cheat, being alone on a trip with someone who is in love with you might be seen as a bad idea. It could create tension, and even if he doesn't act on it, the situation itself might be uncomfortable for both him and his girlfriend. The fact that Melissa is persistent and has feelings complicates things. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't arrange the trip knowing Melissa's feelings. He was unaware and acted in good faith. The trip was supposed to be a group thing, but circumstances led to it being just them. The author is trying to be responsible with money and is confident he can manage the trip without crossing lines. \n\nSo, is it his fault? Maybe not. He didn't know Melissa's feelings beforehand. It's a difficult situation where he's trying to do the right thing by being honest with Amy and not wanting to waste money. However, some might argue that once Melissa's feelings are known, the trip being just the two of them could be seen as inappropriate regardless of his intentions. \n\nBut the key point is that he didn't plan it knowing the feelings. The mistake might be in not canceling after the confession, but if the trip is non-refundable, he's in a bind. The answer might be B, not in the wrong, because he's in a tough spot where he's trying to be responsible and honest. However, others might say that even with good intentions, the situation is inherently problematic. But the question is if he's in the wrong. Since he didn't know and is trying his best to handle it, maybe B is the answer.\n"
