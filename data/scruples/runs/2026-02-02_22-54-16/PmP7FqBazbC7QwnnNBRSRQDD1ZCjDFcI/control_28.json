The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author has a girlfriend, Amy, and a friend, Melissa, who's been in love with him for three years. They planned a trip to Hawaii, which was supposed to be with the college friends but ended up being just them two. The author didn't invite his girlfriend because Melissa thought it wasn't a good idea with someone he'd just started dating. Then, during a party, Melissa made it clear she's in love with him and tried to kiss him. He told her he wasn't feeling well and left. Later, he told Amy about it, and she's upset because they're going on the trip together. The author argues that it's just about the money since he already paid, and he trusts himself not to do anything inappropriate. Amy trusts him but still thinks it's inappropriate.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether going on a trip alone with an ex-love interest is wrong, even if there's no intention to cheat. Melissa has feelings for him, which complicates things. Even if the author is confident he won't act on them, the situation could be seen as risky. Amy's discomfort is valid because the presence of strong emotions from Melissa might lead to situations that could be hard to navigate, regardless of the author's intentions.\n\nThe fact that Melissa tried to kiss him shows she's not holding back her feelings, which could put the author in a position where he has to constantly manage her advances. Even if he's honest and committed to his girlfriend, the trip alone could lead to misunderstandings or pressure. Also, the author initially didn't involve his girlfriend because Melissa thought it wasn't a good idea, which might have been a red flag. Now that Melissa's feelings are out in the open, the trip seems more problematic.\n\nMoney being a factor doesn't negate the relational issues. Trust is important, but trust shouldn't require the other partner to feel uncomfortable or to be in a potentially compromising situation. The fact that Amy is getting upset suggests that the author's decision might not respect her feelings enough. Even if he believes he can handle the trip without issues, the situation is inherently risky and could be seen as a breach of trust or respect towards his girlfriend.\n\nSo, while the author might not intend to do anything wrong, the context and Melissa's feelings make the trip a bad idea. The girlfriend's perspective is valid, and prioritizing financial loss over her emotional well-being might make the author the wrong person here. Answer A makes sense.\n"
