The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for planning a trip to Hawaii with Melissa, who's in love with him, while he's in a 9-month relationship with Amy. \n\nFirst, the setup: The author and Melissa have been friends for three years, and they initially planned the trip as part of a college friend group. When others couldn't agree, it became a two-person trip. Amy was the girlfriend, and he didn't invite her because Melissa said it's a bad idea with someone he just started dating. Amy was okay with them sharing a room as friends. \n\nThen, at a party, Melissa makes a move, saying it's \"our time\" and that she's been in love with him. The author left, then explained it to Amy. Amy feels it's inappropriate to go on the trip alone with her and is upset. The author argues it's about the money and that he's trustworthy.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about trust, boundaries in a relationship, and whether the trip is inappropriate. The author's girlfriend is uncomfortable, even if he thinks it's just about the money. But Melissa is clearly in love with him and tried to kiss him, so there's a potential conflict of interest. \n\nEven if the author believes he can keep things appropriate, the girlfriend's feelings matter here. Trust is important in a relationship, and if the girlfriend is worried that being alone with someone who has feelings for the author could lead to issues, then he might be causing unnecessary stress. Plus, Melissa's actions suggest she might not respect the boundaries, which the author might not be able to control. \n\nAlso, the initial reason for not inviting Amy was because Melissa thought planning a future trip with a new girlfriend was a bad idea. But now, with Melissa's feelings out in the open, that same reasoning doesn't hold. The author's insistence on going despite the girlfriend's concerns could be seen as dismissive of her emotions. \n\nSo considering all that, the author is probably in the wrong for not considering the impact on his girlfriend's trust and for proceeding with a trip that's now a sensitive situation. The answer should be A.\n"
