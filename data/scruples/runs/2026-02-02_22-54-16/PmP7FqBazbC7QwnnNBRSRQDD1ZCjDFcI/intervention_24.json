The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author has a girlfriend, Amy, and a friend Melissa. They were planning a trip to Hawaii together, which was originally supposed to be part of a group trip but ended up being just the two of them. The problem comes when Melissa confesses her love and tries to kiss him. The author tells Amy, and they argue about whether he should cancel the trip because it's inappropriate to go alone with a girl who's in love with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The author is in a 9-month relationship with Amy. Melissa, a friend for 3 years, was in charge of coordinating the trip and convinced the author to make it a two-person trip instead of including the group or Amy. The initial reasoning was that it might not be wise to plan a trip with a new partner. Now, Melissa has made her feelings clear, and Amy is upset about the trip.\n\nThe key points here are trust and boundaries in relationships. Even if the author claims he has no intention of cheating, the situation is potentially awkward. Melissa's feelings might affect the trip, and Amy's trust is being tested. The author argues that it's about the money and he doesn't want to lose the non-refundable costs. But Amy feels it's inappropriate regardless of money, because it's just the two of them with a friend who's in love with him.\n\nI need to think about whether going on the trip is responsible. Even if the author is trustworthy, the situation could be seen as crossing a boundary. Relationships often require setting boundaries to prevent misunderstandings. The fact that Melissa tried to kiss him adds to the tension. So, maybe the author is in the wrong by not considering Amy's feelings and the potential for discomfort or jealousy. Alternatively, if both agree to be appropriate, maybe it's okay. But if the author is prioritizing money over his partner's feelings, that could be a problem. \n\nHmm. The author doesn't want to cancel because of financial reasons, but Amy feels it's a matter of respect and trust. The author says he wants Amy to trust him, but the trip might be a breach of trust even if there's no infidelity. So maybe the answer is that the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting Amy's comfort zone and the potential for the situation to be problematic. Even if he's not cheating, the trip could be seen as inconsiderate towards his girlfriend's feelings.\n"
