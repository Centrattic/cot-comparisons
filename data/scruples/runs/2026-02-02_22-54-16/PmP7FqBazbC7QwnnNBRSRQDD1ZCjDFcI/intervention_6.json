The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author has a girlfriend, Amy, and a female friend, Melissa, who loves him. They had planned a trip to Hawaii, which was supposed to be just the two of them because the group couldn't agree on dates. Now Melissa has confessed her feelings, and the author is considering going on the trip anyway because of the money, but Amy is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has a relationship with Amy, and Melissa is a friend who has feelings for him. The trip was initially planned by both of them, but now Melissa's confession complicates things. The author is in a committed relationship, so the key issue here is whether it's appropriate to go on a solo trip with someone who has romantic feelings for you when you're in a relationship.\n\nAmy feels that it's inappropriate, even though she trusts the author. She's not accusing him of cheating, but she's concerned about the potential for impropriety. The author argues that he has already spent money and that he wouldn't cheat, but the problem is more about perception and trust. \n\nIn relationships, certain actions can be seen as crossing boundaries even if the intention is pure. Being alone on a trip with someone who is romantically interested in you, especially when you're in a relationship, can create situations that might lead to emotional or physical infidelity, even if unintended. The key point here is whether the trip could be a risk to the relationship, regardless of the author's intentions.\n\nTrust is important, but so is respecting the boundaries that the partner feels are necessary. The author might not be \"cheating,\" but he is putting himself in a situation that his partner finds uncomfortable and potentially harmful to their trust. Even if the author believes he can handle it, the fact remains that the situation could lead to jealousy, insecurity, or future issues if something were to happen.\n\nAdditionally, the initial decision to plan the trip without his girlfriend was based on Melissa's advice that it wasn't a good idea when dating someone new. Now that the circumstances have changed, the author should reconsider. The money is a factor, but trust and relationship health are more critical. \n\nSo, even if the author's intentions are good, the act of going on the trip could be seen as inconsiderate of Amy's feelings and the potential risks to their relationship. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's not taking his partner's concerns seriously and is prioritizing his own convenience over maintaining trust and avoiding conflict.\n"
