The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate. WIBTA if I went on this trip anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who's in a 9-month relationship with Amy, but he's planning a trip with his friend Melissa, who's been in love with him for three years. The trip was originally supposed to be with the college friend group, but ended up being just them two. Amy is uncomfortable with them sharing a room but was okay after being assured they're just friends. Then, during a party, Melissa confesses her feelings and tries to kiss him. He tells Amy, and she's upset that he's still going on the trip. He argues it's about the money, but she's now suspicious.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is in a committed relationship, yet he's going on a trip with a friend who has feelings for him. Even if he intends to be faithful, the situation is ripe for conflict and mistrust. The girlfriend's trust is being tested, and the author is prioritizing financial reasons over his partner's emotional well-being. \n\nEven though he hasn't done anything wrong yet, the potential for issues is high. Being in a compromising situation, like a trip with someone who's romantically interested, can lead to problems even if one's intentions are good. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because it's about more than just the act of cheating\u2014it's about the perception and the risk involved. The author's insistence on going despite her concerns shows a lack of consideration for her feelings. \n\nAlso, Melissa's confession complicates things. The trip was already planned with her, and now there's an added layer of tension. The author might not have known about her feelings before, but now that he does, proceeding with the trip could be seen as negligent. The fact that some payments are non-refundable doesn't excuse putting the relationship at risk. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in a position where his actions could be seen as reckless, even if he doesn't intend to do anything wrong. The girlfriend's trust is important, and the author's choice to prioritize money over her comfort and trust might make him the asshole. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
