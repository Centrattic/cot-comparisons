The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, he's in a relationship with Amy for 9 months and has a friend Melissa who's loved him for 3 years. They planned a trip to Hawaii, and Amy wasn't invited initially. Then, Melissa made it clear she's in love with him and tried to kiss him. He told Amy, and now Amy is upset about the trip.\n\nHmm. The main issue is whether it's wrong to go on the trip with Melissa after she's expressed romantic feelings. The author argues it's about the money, but Amy feels it's inappropriate. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the trip was originally planned without Amy because Melissa thought it wouldn't be good to plan a long trip with someone he'd just started dating. But now, Melissa's feelings have been revealed. Even if the author says he won't do anything inappropriate, the situation could be seen as risky. Trust is important in a relationship, and Amy's concern is valid. Even if there's no intention to cheat, being alone on a trip with someone who has romantic feelings might lead to uncomfortable situations. \n\nAlso, the fact that Melissa initiated the romantic advances might affect the dynamics. The author might be putting himself in a position where he's tempted or where Amy feels insecure. Even if he believes he can handle it, the perception is that it's wrong. So, maybe the author is being selfish by prioritizing money over his girlfriend's feelings and trust. \n\nAnother angle: the trip was supposed to be with friends, but now it's just the two of them. That's a different situation. Amy might feel left out and that her partner isn't respecting her boundaries. The author's response about trust is important, but sometimes partners need to accommodate each other even if it's not about cheating. \n\nBut then again, if the author is confident he can handle it and the trip is already paid for, does that matter? However, the emotional cost to the relationship might be higher. If Amy is upset and feels the trip is a breach of trust, even if there's no cheating, it's a conflict in the relationship. \n\nSo, I think the author is in the wrong because going on the trip despite the girlfriend's discomfort could be seen as disrespectful to her feelings, regardless of his intentions. It's not just about cheating; it's about respecting her perspective and the trust in the relationship. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
