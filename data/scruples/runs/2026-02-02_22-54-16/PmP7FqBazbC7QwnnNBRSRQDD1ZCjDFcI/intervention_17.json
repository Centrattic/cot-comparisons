The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate. WIBTA if I went on this trip anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for going on a trip with a friend who's in love with him, while he's in a 9-month relationship. \n\nFirst, the key points: The guy, let's call him John, has a girlfriend, Amy. His friend Melissa, who's been a friend for 3 years, organized a trip to Hawaii with their college friends. Initially, the trip was supposed to be for the group, but Melissa ended up coordinating it for just her and John, saying it was hard to get others on board. John didn't bring up his girlfriend then, following Melissa's reasoning that it's too soon. Now, Melissa is in love with him, and after she confesses her feelings and tries to kiss him, John tells his girlfriend, who is upset that he's going on the trip with Melissa despite the situation.\n\nSo, is John in the wrong? Well, from a relationship ethics standpoint, even if he has no intention of cheating, the trip alone with someone who's in love with him could be seen as problematic. His girlfriend's trust is important, and even if he's innocent, the situation might make her uncomfortable. The fact that Melissa is now expressing her feelings and has tried to kiss him adds to the potential for misunderstanding or mistrust. \n\nJohn argues it's about the money, but his girlfriend is concerned about the appropriateness. Even if he's confident in his actions, the perception matters in a relationship. Melissa's behavior has changed, and going on a trip alone could lead to situations that strain their relationship. Also, the fact that the trip was initially supposed to be with their friend group but now it's just the two of them without others might be another layer of issue.\n\nOn the other hand, John didn't know Melissa had feelings for him until after the trip was planned. He didn't push for the trip to be just them; Melissa suggested it. But after her confession, continuing the trip without her knowing could be seen as disregarding his girlfriend's feelings. \n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is valid because trust and comfort are crucial. Even if John hasn't done anything wrong yet, the setup of the trip post-confession could be seen as risky. It's possible that John is in the wrong because he's prioritizing the financial aspect over his partner's emotional well-being. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because the situation is inherently a conflict of interests between his financial commitment and his partner's trust. Even if his intentions are good, the potential for misunderstanding and harm to the relationship is there. The fact that his girlfriend is upset and feels interrogated shows that trust is being tested, and sometimes in relationships, the perception and the effort to prevent conflict matter more than the actual actions.\n"
