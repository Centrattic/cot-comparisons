The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for planning a trip with his girlfriend's friend, who's in love with him. The situation is a Reddit-style \"Will I Be The Asshole\" scenario.\n\nFirst, the author has a girlfriend, Amy, and a friend, Melissa, who organized a trip. They initially planned it as a group but ended up going alone. The author didn't invite Amy because Melissa thought it wasn't a good idea with a new relationship. Then, Melissa confesses her feelings and tries to kiss him. The author tells Amy, and they argue about whether to cancel the trip. The author wants to go because of non-refundable costs, but Amy feels it's inappropriate.\n\nI need to consider relationship boundaries. Being in a monogamous relationship usually means avoiding situations that could lead to cheating or appear unfaithful. Even if the author has no intention of being unfaithful, being alone with an ex or someone who has feelings for you can be risky. Melissa's feelings complicate things further, especially after she tried to kiss him. The fact that the author had to lie or not tell the whole truth from the start (like not inviting Amy initially) might be a point against him.\n\nAlso, Amy's trust is important. Even if the author believes he can stay appropriate, the trip might erode Amy's trust. The argument isn't just about money anymore, which suggests deeper issues. The author's insistence on going despite Amy's concerns could be seen as dismissive of her feelings and the potential risks. Relationships require compromise, and in this case, the author is prioritizing financial loss over emotional safety. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest now and doesn't plan to cheat. But intentions don't always align with outcomes. The situation with Melissa's feelings creates a scenario where mistakes can happen. Even if the author doesn't want to, being in a vulnerable situation with someone who's emotionally invested can lead to complications. \n\nSo, even if the author hasn't done anything wrong yet, continuing with the trip might be crossing a boundary in the relationship. The key is whether the trip is a responsible decision considering the existing trust issues and Melissa's feelings. The answer might be that the author is in the wrong because he's putting his relationship at risk by not considering Amy's perspective and the potential consequences, even if his intentions are good.\n"
